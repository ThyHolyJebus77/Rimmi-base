# Mansions of Madness 2e - Rules
## Setup

Separate the **Investigator cards** into decks by type. Shuffle
the **Damage** and **Horror** decks separately and place them
facedown. Organise the cards in the **Common Item** , **Unique
Item** , **Spell** , and **Condition** decks alphabetically and place
them faceup.

Organise the **map tiles** by size. Organise the **monsters**
with their matching tokens. Separate all **tokens** into pools
by type.

Run the **app** , ensure that all expansions you wish to play
with are enabled, and select **New Game**. As a group,
decide which story to play and select it. Alternatively,
resume a saved game by selecting **Continue**.

Each player chooses an **investigator** and takes its card and
figure. Then input the chosen investigators into the app. If
playing solo, choose 2 investigators.

Players take the specific possessions as instructed by the
app and distribute them among the investigators as they
choose.

Read aloud the scenario’s **Prologue** , place the starting map
tile, Investigator figures, and other tokens as instructed,
and perform any other steps required by the app.

```
At any time, players may access a record of all
messages displayed by the app by selecting
Message Log from the in-game menu.
```
Players can **save** the progress of the current scenario, **quit** ,
and resume playing during another session. If players
intend to resume the game later, they should record their
possessions, damage and horror, and the positions of their
figures, monsters, and possessions on the board. Map tiles
and tokens on the board are recorded by the app. The app
records only a single saved game at a time: starting a new
game overwrites any previously saved game.

## Playing the Game

## Investigator Phase

Investigators take turns in the order of their choice.
**On an investigator’s turn, he performs up to 2 actions of
his choice**.

You may perform the same action more than once per
round.

You may tap any token in the app to inspect it (this does
not require an action and the token does not have to be in
your space). You cannot select an action preceded by
unless you expend an action.

## Move Action

**Move your investigator figure up to 2 spaces** , one space at
a time, from one space to an adjacent space.

You cannot move through walls (solid brown lines) or
impassable borders (dashed white or yellow lines) unless
an effect specifically allows it.

```
You may interrupt your Move action to perform another
action. After you have finished performing that action, you
may finish performing your Move action.
```
```
If you attempt to move out of a space that contains a
monster, you must first resolve an evade check.
```
## Explore Action

```
Use the app to reveal an adjacent room. You must
occupy the same space as the Explore token, or a space
adjacent to the door the token is on. Tap the Explore
token corresponding to the area you want to explore, then
confirm the action by selecting Explore.
Resolve the effects as instructed by the app. After all
tiles and tokens have been placed, you may move into the
explored area as instructed by the app.
```
## Search Action

```
Use the app to search in your space. Tap a Search token
in your space, then confirm the action by selecting
Search. Resolve the effect as instructed by the app.
```
## Trade Action

```
You may give any number of possessions (common items,
unique items, or spells) to each other investigator in your
space and allow those investigators to give you any number
of their possessions. Additionally, you may pick up or drop
any number of possessions in your space.
```
## Interact Action

```
Use the app to interact with a person or object in your
space. Tap a Person or Interact token in your space, then
confirm the action by selecting an action preceded by.
Resolve the effect as instructed by the app.
```
## Component Actions

```
Component actions are described by the component
or effect that allows you to perform that action. Those
on cards are preceded by the word Action and can be
performed by the investigator who has that card.
```
```
Some items allow you to perform a component
action by using the app. Open the inventory by
pressing the Inventory button in the bottom-left
corner of the screen and select the item.
```
```
Then confirm your action by selecting an option preceded
by action. Resolve the effect as instructed by the app.
```
## Attack Action

```
Use the app to attack a monster. Select the
monster you want to attack from the monster
drawer, then press the Attack button.
Confirm your action by selecting the option that
corresponds to your chosen attack type:
```
```
Attack with a Heavy Weapon;
Attack with a Bladed Weapon;
Attack with a Firearm;
Attack with a spell , or
Attack unarmed.
```
```
If you are using a weapon or spell with the melee
icon you can only attack a monster in your space.
```
```
If you are using a weapon or spell with the ranged
icon you can attack any monster within 3 spaces.
```
```
Range cannot be counted through walls or doors
unless an effect specifically allows it, but can be
counted through impassable borders.
Then resolve the effect as instructed by the app.
```
```
Use the + and – buttons in the monster menu to record the
damage the monster suffers.
```
## End of Investigator Phase

```
After all investigators have taken a turn, one of
them presses the End Phase button i n the bottom-
right corner of the screen to end the Investigator
phase and proceed to the Mythos phase.
```
## Mythos Phase

```
There are 3 types of effects the app can generate in the
Mythos phase:
```
## Mythos Events

```
The app generates Mythos events: resolve the effects as
instructed by the app.
```
```
After all mythos events for the round have been resolved,
the app generates instructions for activating monsters.
```
```
If there are no monsters on the board, the Mythos phase
ends automatically instead.
```
## Monster Activations

```
The app generates instructions for activating each monster,
one at a time; describing how to move each monster and
how each monster attacks.
```
```
Resolve the effects as instructed by the app.
```
```
After all monsters have activated for the round, the app
instructs investigators to resolve horror checks.
```
## Horror Checks

```
The app instructs each investigator to resolve a horror
check against a single monster within range with the
highest horror rating (choose one if there are several).
```
```
If you are not within range of any monsters, you do not
resolve a horror check.
```
```
Select the monster from the monster drawer and resolve
the effect as instructed by the app.
```
## End of Mythos Phase

```
After all investigators have resolved horror checks,
one of them presses the End Phase button to end
the Mythos phase and begin the next round.
```
## Damage & Horror

```
When an effect causes you to suffer damage or horror ,
draw the top card of the Damage or Horror deck,
respectively. Claim the card faceup unless the effect
specifies otherwise.
```
```
When you claim a faceup card with the Resolve
Immediately trait, immediately resolve its effect (this
usually includes flipping the card facedown). A card with
the Keep Faceup trait has a lasting effect for as long as the
card remains faceup.
When an effect instructs you to flip one or more damage
or horror faceup, select them at random from among all of
your facedown Damage or Horror cards.
```
```
When an effect allows you discard a damage or horror,
you may discard a faceup card of your choice or a random
facedown card. Shuffle it into the appropriate deck.
```
## Wounded

```
When you suffer damage (faceup or facedown) equal to
or exceeding your health, you become wounded. Gain
a Wounded condition and discard all of your facedown
Damage cards.
```
```
While wounded, you cannot perform the Move action more
than once each round.
A wounded investigator that suffers damage equal to or
exceeding his health is eliminated.
```
## Insane

```
When you suffer horror (faceup or facedown) equal to or
exceeding your sanity, you become insane. Gain an Insane
condition and discard all of your facedown Horror cards.
```
```
Read the back of your Insane condition (you cannot reveal
the back of the card to the other investigators).
```
```
Your Insane condition might alter how you win and lose
the game. In such a case, you may want to perform one or
more of the rarely used actions ( Push , Set Fire , or Steal ).
Each Insane condition has a required number of investigators
on the bottom-right corner on the card back. When you
gain an Insane condition, if the number of investigators is
less than the required number of investigators, discard that
card and gain a different copy of the Insane condition.
```
```
An insane investigator that suffers horror equal to or
exceeding his sanity is eliminated.
```
## Eliminated

```
When you are eliminated , drop all your possessions in your
space and remove your figure from the board.
The remaining investigators have a single additional
Investigator phase to attempt to complete their investigation.
At the end of that Investigator phase, if the investigators
did not complete the investigation, they lose the game.
```
```
A player then selects the Investigator Eliminated option
from the in-game menu to end the game.
```

## Rarely Used Actions

## Push Action

To **push** a monster or another investigator, choose an
adjacent space and either a monster or another investigator
in your space.

If a chosen investigator chooses to move willingly, resolve
the movement.

If pushing a monster, the test difficulty is equal to the
monster’s **brawn**. If pushing another investigator, that
investigator tests **strength** ; the test difficulty is equal
to the test result plus 1.

Test your **strength** : if the result equals or exceeds the test
difficulty, resolve the movement. If the result is less than
the test difficulty, then you forfeit this action without
resolution.

When moved, the monster or chosen investigator moves
1 space toward the chosen space. Then you may move 1
space toward the chosen space.

## Set Fire Action

You can perform this action only if you have a **light source**.
If there is not already fire on the board, select the **Set Fire**
option from the in-game menu.

## Steal Action

To **take possessions** from another investigator, choose
another investigator in your space and choose **strength** ,
**agility** , or **observation**. Then both investigators test
that skill.

You may take 1 possession from the chosen investigator
for each you roll in excess of the chosen investigator’s
result.

If the chosen investigator’s result equals or exceeds
your result, you forfeit this action without taking any
possessions.

## Skill Tests

When you are resolving an effect that includes a **skill icon**
in the text, you must immediately test that skill.

**Roll a number of dice equal to your value in the indicated
skill** (+/- any modifiers). Roll a minimum of 1 die.

After rolling, you may spend a **clue** to convert a single
**investigation result** to a **success result**. You
may do so multiple times as long as you spend a clue for
each result you convert. Determine your test result after
resolving all conversions.

The number of **success results** rolled is the **test result**.

**Skill Test Difficulty**
Skill tests may include a test difficulty in parentheses
separated from the skill icon by a semicolon. This number
indicates the number of success results required to pass
the test. If you do not roll enough , you fail the test.

**Negating Damage & Horror**
Some effects cause you to suffer multiple damage or horror
at the same time but allow you to resolve a skill test to
negate some or all of it. To do so, test the indicated skill.
You prevent 1 damage or 1 horror for each rolled.

**Skill Tests in the App**
Some skill tests in app instructions require you to input
your test result (the number of success results required
to pass is unknown). Even if you fail the test, the app
remembers how many were previously rolled. Future
attempts to pass the test will require fewer.

## Monsters

```
When an effect spawns a monster, place a copy of that
monster as indicated. Each monster token includes the
following information:
Awareness (top right-hand corner): Referenced when
an investigator resolves an evade check in a space that
contains multiple monsters.
```
```
Horror Rating (bottom right-hand corner): Referenced when
an investigator resolves a horror check within range of
multiple monsters.
```
```
Brawn (bottom right-hand corner on reverse): A monster’s
physical prowess; referenced by various effects.
```
```
Use the ID tokens to mark unique monsters and to
differentiate monsters from others of the same type. The
app may indicate one of the ID tokens to be assigned to
a newly spawned monster; place the specified ID token in
the figure’s base. A monster retains its ID token for as long
as it remains in play.
```
## Evading Monsters

```
If you are in a space containing a monster and attempt to
leave your space or perform an action other than the Attack
or Move actions, you must first evade the monster. If there
are multiple monsters in your space, you must evade only
the monster with the highest awareness (choose one if
there are several).
Select the monster from the monster drawer, then press the
Evade button and resolve the effect as instructed by the app.
After evading a monster, perform your action as normal
unless the effect states that your action is forfeit. If you
forfeit your action, you lose your action without resolving
any part of its effect. If you forfeit your action while
moving, you lose any remaining movement and do not
leave your space.
If you move out of a monster’s space involuntarily you do
not resolve an evade check.
```
## Items, Spells, Conditions

```
When you discard a common item, unique item, spell, or
condition, return it to its respective deck.
```
```
Items and spells are possessions and may be dropped,
picked up and traded.
```
## Items

```
When you gain a common or unique item , claim the card
(art side faceup). If the item has a unique back, you may
read the back at any time unless an effect states you
cannot.
```
## Spells

```
When you gain a spell , claim a random copy of that spell
(art side faceup). You cannot look at the back of a spell
until an effect causes the spell to flip.
Whenever you cast a spell, its effect instructs you to flip
the card. When you flip the card, immediately resolve the
effect on its back.
```
## Conditions

```
Occasionally, an effect will cause you to gain a condition.
When you gains a condition, claims a copy of that card
(art side up). You cannot gain multiple copies of the same
condition.
```
```
Some conditions are double-sided (if so, claim a random
copy of that condition). You cannot look at the back of a
condition unless an effect allows you to do so.
```
## Features

```
All features are square tokens. Interacting with a feature
does not require the app.
```
## Barricades

```
As an action, an investigator in a space containing
a barricade may move the barricade against a
door/secret passage or move the barricade away
from the door/secret passage it blocks.
```
```
You cannot move a barricade to another space unless an
effect specifically allows it.
```
```
Investigators cannot move through blocked doors/secret
passages.
```
```
You may try to move a barricade on the other side of a
door/secret passage by testing strength.
If you roll 2 or more , move the barricade away, then
move 1 space through the door/secret passage.
```
```
If a monster attempts to move through a blocked door/
secret passage, it rolls a number of dice equal to its brawn
(+/- any modifiers). If it rolls 2 or more , the barricade
is discarded and the monster moves as normal. Otherwise,
the monster forfeits its movement.
```
## Darkness

```
An investigator in a space containing darkness
cannot spend clues to convert dice results or
perform additional puzzle steps.
```
```
Each investigator in or adjacent to a space containing a
light source or fire ignores the effects of darkness.
```
```
Darkness cannot be placed in a space that contains
darkness.
```
## Fire

```
Whenever an investigator moves into a space
containing fire , performs an action other than the
Move action or forfeits an action in a space
containing fire, he suffers 1 facedown damage.
```
```
Whenever a monster starts its activation in a space
containing fire or moves into a space containing fire, it
suffers 1 damage.
As an action, you may attempt to extinguish fire by testing
your agility. For each you roll, you may discard 1 Fire
token from your space or a space you move into later during
the round. Fire discarded this way does not damage you.
```
```
At the beginning of each Mythos phase, fire spreads. If one
or more spaces contain fire, place 1 Fire token in a space
adjacent to a space that contains fire.
```
```
Fire cannot be placed in a space that contains fire.
```
## Secret Passages

```
An investigator or monster in a space containing
a secret passage can move to any other space
containing a secret passage as if those spaces
were adjacent (unless it is blocked by a barricade).
Range cannot be counted through a secret passage.
```
## Puzzles

```
Puzzles are resolved entirely using the app. A puzzle step
is a single unit of progress toward solving a puzzle; the
types of puzzle steps you can perform are defined by the
type of puzzle.
```
```
When you attempt a puzzle, perform a number of puzzle
steps equal to your value in the skill indicated by that
effect.
```
```
While attempting a puzzle, you may spend any number
of your clues to perform 1 additional puzzle step for each
clue spent.
After you have has performed all of your allotted puzzle
steps, if the puzzle is not solved, press the Close button.
Your progress will be saved so that you or another
investigator can continue solving the puzzle at a later time.
```
```
The app automatically detects when a puzzle is solved.
At which point, the investigator who solved the puzzle
continues resolving his action as instructed by the app.
```
## Slide Puzzle

```
Attempt to assemble an image that has been split into 6 or
more pieces. The pieces of a slide puzzle are displayed in
a grid and randomized.
```
```
As a puzzle step, you can swap any 2 adjacent pieces by
dragging one of them over the other.
```
```
The puzzle is solved when all pieces of the puzzle are in
the correct position and the puzzle’s image is properly
displayed.
```
## Code Puzzle

```
Attempt to determine a code made of 3 or more pieces
(numbers or runes). The pieces that can make up the code
are displayed at the top of the screen, and each can be
used any number of times.
As a puzzle step, you can guess the code by dragging one
piece into each of the current guess brackets and selecting
Guess.
```
```
If the guess is incorrect, you receive information about
your guess. The app marks each incorrect guess with a
number of success and investigation results. Each
indicates that a single piece of the guess is the correct
piece and is correctly positioned within the code. Each
indicates that the guess contains a single correct
piece, but that piece is not in the correct position.
```
```
The puzzle is solved when you guess the correct code.
```
## Lock Puzzle

```
Attempt to maneuver pieces in a grid to allow the visually
unique goal piece to be removed.
As a puzzle step, you can move any piece by dragging it in
the direction of its orientation—vertically or horizontally.
No 2 pieces can occupy the same space of the grid, and a
piece cannot be moved through other pieces.
```
```
The puzzle is solved when the goal piece is moved to the
far right side of the grid.
```
## Winning the Game

```
The scenario determines what the investigators need to
do to win the game, but this objective is hidden from the
investigators. The investigators must unravel the mystery
and discover their ultimate goal.
After the investigation has progressed enough, the
objective will be revealed, giving the investigators one final
task to complete the investigation. When the investigation
is complete, investigators win the game.
```
```
If the investigators take too long to complete the
investigation, the scenario’s objective might change or
become more difficult to accomplish. If the investigators
continue to take too long, investigators lose the game.
When an investigator is eliminated, the game ends at
the end of the next investigator phase. At the end of that
investigator phase, if the investigation is not complete,
investigators lose the game.
```
