iii. Free	construction	chain - If	you	have	Constructed an	Age	I/II	
Building	with	an	icon	in	its	effect	bar matching	the	icon	in	the	
cost bar of	an Age II/III Card,	you	may	add	that Age	II/III	with	
the	same	icon	to your	tableau	for	free.	
2. Discard	the	Building	to	Gain Coins - Discard	the Building Card	and	take	2	coins	
+	1	coin	per yellow	card	in	your	city from	the	bank.	
3. Construct	a	Wonder – Place	the	Building	Card face-down	under	the	Wonder	card	
being constructed. Pay	the	building	cost	of	the	Wonder (not the	Building),	as	per	
the	rules	 for Constructing	a Building.	The	effect	of	 the	Wonder	is	now	active	(an	
immediate	effect,	or	an	ongoing	effect).
a. Only	7	Wonders in	total may	be	built over	the	course	of	the game.	The	
8th	Wonder is	returned	to	the	box when	the	7th is	built.
An	Age	ends	when	all	20	cards	from	the	display	have	been	played.	Proceed	to	the start	
of	the next	Age,	or	Final	Scoring.
End	 of	 the	 Game	 and	 Victory:	 A	 game	 ends	 immediately	 in	 the	 case	 of	 a	 Military	
Supremacy,	 a	Scientific	 Supremacy,	 or	 failing	 this,	 at	 the	 end	 of	 Age	 III,	 resulting	in	 a	
Civilian	Victory after	Final	Scoring.
Military	Icons:	Each	time	a	Military	Building or	Wonder is	constructed,	the	active	player
immediately	 moves the	 Conflict	 pawn	 one	 space	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 the	 opposing	
capital for	each	Shield	Icon on	the	card	constructed.	When	the	Conflict	pawn	enters	a new
Zone (denoted	by	dotted	lines),	the	active	player	applies	the	effect	of	the	corresponding	
token,	then	returns	it	to	the	box. If	the	conflict	pawn	re-enters	a	Zone	where	the	token	is	
already	spent,	there	is	no	effect.

constructs	the	Scientific	Building	matching	the	icons	of	a	Scientific	Building	already	in	their	
City,	 they	 immediately	 choose	 one	 of	 the	 Progress	 tokens on	 the	 game	 board (and

and	that	player	declares	a	Civilian	Victory.	Players	score	points	as	follows:
• Victory	points	(0,	2,	5,	or	10) for the	position	of	the	Conflict	Pawn.
• Victory	 points	depicted	 on Buildings you	 have	 Constructed (usually	 on	blue,	
green,	yellow,	and	purple	cards).
• Victory	 points	 depicted	 on	 Wonders you	 have	 Constructed. Wonders	 not	
constructed	score	0	Points.

• Remaining	Money: each	complete	set	of	3	coins	is	worth	1	point.
The	player	who	has	the	most	victory	points	wins	the	game.	In	case	of	a	tie,	the	player	who	
has	the	most	victory	points	from	their	Civilian	Buildings	(blue	cards)	wins	the	game.	If	this	
is	also	a	tie,	then	the players	share	their	victory.


7W⊙NDERS DUEL
C⊙NS⊙LIDATED RULES WITH THE PANTHE⊙N EXPANSI   N
⊙


Introduction & Goal
Two players lead their own city over three ages. They will construct buildings which help them produce materials, earn coins, strengthen their military and make scientific discoveries. And eventually
they will build Wonders which will earn them glory and renown throughout the world.
Setup
Throughout setup, unused components are returned the box without looking at them.
1. Place the board between the two players to one side of the play area.
With Pantheon, place its board above the main board.
2. Place the conflict pawn on the middle space on the track and the 4 military tokens face up on the spaces next to it.
3. Shuffle the 10 progress tokens and deal 5 of them, face up, onto the spaces.
With Pantheon, shuffle in the 3 new progress tokens (Poliorcetics, Mysticism, and Engineering) into the stack before dealing them.
4. Place all the coins in the middle to form a bank. To start, each player takes 7 coins.

5. Shuffle each Age’s deck (I, II, III) and place them face down. From each deck, return 3 random cards to the box unrevealed. a. Without Pantheon, shuffle 3 Guild cards into Age III’s deck. b. With Pantheon, shuffle 3 Grand Temple cards into Age III’s
deck.
6. Place the Age I cards in their structure.
With Pantheon, place 5 random mythology tokens face down on to the structure.






7. Shuffle the Wonder cards. Reveal 4 between the two players, face up. The first player takes 1. Then the second player takes 2. The first player takes the remaining 1.
Do this again, but start with the other player first.
8. With Pantheon, shuffle the 5 decks of Divinity cards, and place them face down next to the Pantheon board. Other tokens should be within reach.
On your Turn
Take an accessible card (not covered by any other card) from the card structure and build it, discard it or build a Wonder instead. Or, with Pantheon, invoke a Divinity instead.
Reveal any face-down cards which are no longer covered by others. With Pantheon, in Age I, also take any mythology token on top
the cards that were just revealed. Keep the token face up. Draw 2 cards from its Divinity deck and place one card face down on an empty Pantheon space and return the other card.
With Pantheon, in Age II, also take any offering token on top the cards that were just revealed. Look at the token, but keep it face down.
a) To build a Building card
Pay the cost of the Building (top left of the card) and then place it in your city.
a. Some cards are free.
b. Resources can be paid from your cards (mostly brown or grey cards) or trading with the bank. To trade, for each resource you need, pay 2 coins plus 1 coin for each of this resource on your opponent’s grey and brown cards.
c. If you have a Building with a white chain symbol (top right), you can build subsequent buildings with this symbol (under their cost) for free.
d. With Pantheon, if you have a mythology token with a symbol matching a Grand Temple in Age III, you may build 1that Temple for free.



b) To discard a Building card
Discard the Building card and gain 2 coins plus 1 coin per yellow card in your city. Discarded cards are placed face-down next to the board. Players can look at the discard pile.
c) To build a Wonder
Pay the cost of one of your Wonders as with a Building. Place the card, face down, under it, poking out slightly to show the Wonder has been built. The Building card has no other effect.
When the game’s 7th Wonder has been built, the last unbuilt Wonder is returned to the box.
d) To invoke a Divinity (with Pantheon)
In Ages II and III, instead of taking a card from the structure, choose a Divinity or the Gate from the Pantheon board.
Pay the cost pointing to you in coins and/or offering tokens. The cost of the Gate is double the cost shown.
Take and keep the card and activate its ability.
End of an Age
An Age ends when all cards from its structure have been played. Prepare the next Age’s structure, or if it is the end of Age III,
proceed to Scoring.
The weaker player on the military track decides who will go first in the next Age. Or, in a draw, the player who drew the last card decides who will go first.
Start of Age II	Start of Age III
Place the Age II cards in their	Place the Age III cards in their structure.	structure.
With Pantheon, reveal the Divinity Cards on the Pantheon and place the Gate card in the empty space. Place 3 random offering tokens face up on the structure.

Victory Conditions
Military Icons and Military Victory
Each shield (mostly on red cards) immediately moves the conflict pawn one space towards the opposing capital. When it crosses a dotted line into a new zone, apply the effect of any military token there and return it to the box.
If the conflict pawn reaches your opponent’s capital, you immediately win the game.
Science Icons and Science Victory
There are 7 different scientific symbols in the game (6 on 2 cards each, one on a development token). Each time you gain 2 of the same symbol, immediately take and keep a progress token from the board (before revealing any uncovered cards on the structure).
If you have 6 different science symbols, you immediately win the game.
Scoring and Civilian Victory
At the end of Age III, if no one has won yet, count up victory points: • From the conflict pawn’s position (0, 2, 5, or 10).
• From progress tokens.
• From your Buildings (blue, green, yellow, and purple cards). • From your Wonders.
• With Pantheon, 5, 12 or 21 victory points for 1, 2 or 3 Grand Temples, respectively.
• With Pantheon, from your Divinities.
• Each complete set of 3 coins is 1 victory point.
Highest number of victory points wins. In a draw, victory points from civilian Buildings (blue cards) wins the game. If it is still a draw, then it really is a draw.
Guilds (without Pantheon only)
Builders Guild: This is worth 2 victory points for each Wonder constructed in the city that has the most Wonders.
Moneylenders Guild: This is worth 1 victory point for every 3 coins in the richest city (in addition to the normal victory points for coins).
The following Guilds are similar. Merchants Guild: Yellow cards.
Ship-Owners Guild: Brown and grey cards, added together. Magistrates Guild: Blue cards.
Scientists Guild: Green cards. Tacticians Guild: Red cards.
When these are built, gain 1 coin for each indicated card in the city that has the most of them.
Additionally, at the end of the game these cards are worth 1 victory point for each indicated card in the city that has the most of them.
Progress tokens
Agriculture: Immediately gain 6 coins. The token is worth 4 victory points.

Strategy: Any future military Buildings (red cards) built by you will have 1 extra Shield. Note, this does not apply to Wonders that have the Shield symbol.
Theology: All future Wonders constructed by you have the “Play Again” effect. Note, this is wasted on Wonders that already have this effect.

Engineering (Pantheon): You can build, for 1 coin, any card that has a chaining symbol (white symbol) under its cost, even if your city does not contain the
Building or token that has that symbol. This does not trigger the Urbanism bonus if you have both cards.
Grand Temples (with Pantheon)
If you have a Mythology token that has the chaining symbol of a Grand Temple, you may construct that card for free. You can also construct a Grand Temple by paying its cost.
At the end of the game, you score 5, 12, or 21 victory points if you’ve built 1, 2, or 3 Grand Temples, respectively.
Divinities (with Pantheon)

## Solo

7 WONDERS DUEL : THE SOLO CHALLENGE Solo variant proposed by La Société des Jeux / The Board Game Society
(Version 2.0 - last updated on the 7th August 2017)

Set-up:

Use the same configuration as a 2 player game with the exception of the following modifications:

1.   Before placing the progress tokens, remove the Economy and Strategy tokens and give them to your opponent. He will start with these 2 upgrades, then randomly place 5 progress tokens on the game board, and keep the 3 remaining tokens close by.

1.   After shuffling the Wonder Cards, randomly select 7 cards to form a single face down deck. The other Wonder cards are returned to the box.
2.   All other set-up elements are identical, including the preparation for the card decks of ages 1 to 3 as well as the layout of the cards for each of the Ages.

Objective for the Solo Challenge:

Before the end of age 3, complete the construction of the 7 Wonders AND obtain a Military OR Scientific Supremacy. You will win if you meet both victory conditions and your end-of-game score is higher than your opponent.

Game Turns :

At the beginning of the game, reveal the first Wonder card to build, the other cards remain face down and will be revealed one by one, once the Wonder card is completed. Your opponent will always be the first player, start by selecting an available card to give him, regardless of purchase prerequisites (for your opponent only), then you proceed with your turn in the usual way. You alternate each turn, giving a card to your opponent and a card for yourself until the end of Age 1. Once the first Age is complete, set-up the cards according to the Age 2 layout. You will then start over by giving your opponent a card and taking one for yourself and so on. This process will also be identical for the third age, ending the game, once the last card has been picked up.

Reminder: Each military card given to your opponent receives a +1 advancement bonus due to the strategy Progress Token. In addition, when trading for resources, you hand over the entire cost of the transaction to your opponent because of his Economy Progress Token. During the game,  if  your  opponent  succeeds  in  completing  a  Military  or  Scientific  Supremacy,  you immediately lose the game...

Note: Updated rules 2.0

When your opponent has the opportunity to take a Progress Token, he will choose in the following order:

1.   Law, this token is worth a scientific symbol
2.   Mathematics, scoring 3 victory points for each Progress Token in your possession (including itself)
3.   Philosophy, giving him 7 victory points
4.   Agriculture, immediately take 6 coins from the bank, the token is worth 4 victory points 5.   Urbanism, immediately take 6 coins from the bank – each time you construct a building
for free through linking, you gain 4 coins
6.   For the Balance : Theologie, Masonry, Architecture

Upon final point counting, each 3 coins grants 1 additional victory point.

To determine the score of the solo challenge, simply compare between your points and that of your opponent.
