## Quick Start Rules Guide

1. Setup:
   - Each player gets: 1 Monster card, 3 Power Boost cards (1, 2, and 3), and 1 Power Dial
   - Choose 2 Katakana cards to add to your Monster (this creates your unique monster)
   - Shuffle the Power cards and City cards separately

2. Start of Each Round:
   - Draft 12 Power cards (pick 1, pass the rest, repeat)
   - Place 6 City cards face-up in the center

3. How to Battle:
   - The "Angriest Monster" picks a city to fight for
   - Players take turns either playing Power cards or passing
   - To play Power cards:
     * Play cards of the same type (e.g., all Fire or all Toxic)
     * You can't play more cards than your monster's icons for that type
     * Add up the numbers, then multiply by how many cards you played
     * You can add ONE Power Boost card to increase your total
   - Your play must beat the highest current power total
   - If you can't or don't want to play, you must pass (you're out for this city)
   - Last player left wins the city card

4. Winning the Game:
   - Play 3 rounds (18 city battles total)
   - Add up the points on your city cards
   - Most points wins!

5. Important Things to Remember:
   - You can only play each power type once per battle
   - Use your Power Dial to keep track of your current power in a battle
   - After each round, discard remaining Power cards and draft new ones
   - Have fun and make silly monster noises!

This simplified guide should help new players get started quickly. The key is to focus on the core mechanics of drafting, playing power sets, and battling for cities without overwhelming them with too many details upfront.

# RARRR!! - Rules

OVERVIEW
RARRR!! is a card game of earth-shaking battles between giant Japanese movie monsters (daikaiju). Each player creates a monster, builds up its power, and then battles with other monsters for the right to destroy the world’s greatest cities.

12 Monster Cards

COMPONENTS
There are 12 horrifying monsters in this game! Each has a syllable in Japanese, along with its Roman equivalent.
It also shows the monster’s starting powers.

Starting Monster Powers


Katakana cards are drafted to help complete your Monster. Two Katakana cards placed next to a Monster card
finish its name, and give it additional powers.

6 Power    The Power Dials are used Dials    to keep track of the amount
of power your Monster has committed to the current battle. The left (10’s) dial has values 0-15, the right (1’s) side has values 0-9. To show more than 159 power (the dial’s max) simply add 100 to the power shown on the dial.

HOW TO DRAFT
Drafting provides a way for players to select from a set of cards rather than just getting a completely random hand. RARRR!! has drafts for Katakana cards during setup and Power cards at the start of each round.
To draft, first deal out the designated number of cards to each player, for instance 3 Katakana cards. Each player looks at his hand of cards, selects one and puts it face-down in front of them. (Players can look at their own face-down cards any time.) Then the rest of the cards are passed to his left.
Players repeat selecting one card and passing the rest to the left until all of the cards have been drafted.

OBJECTIVE
The game consists of three rounds, each with six cities. The Angriest Monster selects cities to destroy. Whoever bids the most Power on a city destroys it and gets its victory points.
Players must wisely draft power cards to fuel their Monster, and make the smartest bids to destroy cities.
After three rounds, the player with the most Victory Points wins.

SETUP
Give each player
• One set of three Power Boost cards
• One Power Dial
Shufle the Katakana, Power and City cards into their own decks.
Give the Angriest Monster card to the angriest player. If players cannot decide which player is angriest, then give it to the oldest player.



G


DE


Example: This monster is named Gofude and is heavy in Radioactive power.

Now create the Monsters. Randomly deal one Monster card to each player.
Deal three Katakana cards to each player. Place the rest of the Katakana cards in the box — theywill not be used for the rest of the game.
Draft the Katakana cards around the table. To learn about how to draft, see the sidebar on the previous page.
Players select two of the three Katakana cards to use with their Monster, then place the third card in the box — it will not be used.
Players lay the two Katakana cards next to their Monster card, in any order. In the example at the bottom of this page, the Monster’s name is Gofude, but could easily be named Fugode, Degofu, etc. by simply rearranging the cards. Players should announce the

name of their monster to all at the table and make the sound their Monster would make if it were destroying a city.
PLAYING THE GAME RARRR!! is played in three rounds. Each round consists of the
• Power-up Phase followed by a
• Battle Phase
At the end of each round, any remaining Power cards are discarded from players’ hands, and all of the Power cards are reshufled to start the next Power-up Phase.
The Power-Up Phase
Shufle the Power cards and deal 12 to each player. Players draft the Power cards the same way they drafted Katakana cards. At the end of the draft, each player’s 12 Power cards become his Power Hand for that round.
One player deals out six City cards face-up to the center of the table. These are the cities over that Monsters will be battling over this round.
The Battle Phase
All players set the power levels to zero on their Power Dials.
The player holding the Angriest Monster card selects one City card to be contested in this Battle, and either passes or plays one or more sets of Power cards, adding their values to their Monster’s Power Level. See the spread on the next two pages to learn how to play Power cards into a Battle.

After the player with the Angriest monster plays Power cards or passes, play passes
to the left, with each player in turn either:
• playing one or more sets of Power cards to increase his Monster’s Power Level above the highest power level of all of the other Monsters, or
• passing. Players who pass are out until the next the next City Battle.
The Battle continues until all but one player has passed. The last player remaining wins
the Battle, takes the City card and places it face-up in front of him. He then discards all Power cards played in this battle, and removes any Power Boost cards he played from the game.

PLAYING POWER CARDS INTO A BATTLE
Here are the rules for how you can play Power cards from your hand to the table when battling.
Playing Sets
Power cards are laid on the table face-up in sets, as follows:
• Each set has a single Power type. There must be at least one card of this Power type in the set. A Power Boost card does not count toward this minimum.
• Players cannot add to sets after they have been played to the table and and can only play one set of each Power type in each Battle.
• The number of Power cards in a set cannot exceed the number of Power icons of that type on that player’s Monster cards.
• The total Power of the set is the sum of the values of the Power cards of that type in the set multiplied by the number of cards in the set.
• One single-use Power Boost card may be used to increase the total Power of the set. Power Boost cards do not count as a card in the set for purposes of the Monster limit or multiplier.
• A player can lay multiple sets at the same time.
• Sets can only be played if they increase the Monster’s Power Level above those of all other Monsters.
After playing sets to the table, the player adjusts his Power Level to match the total amount of Power he played into the Battle.
Passing
When a player passes, he removes any Power Boost cards he played from the game. Then he may take one Power card that he played in this battle back into his hand. All of the other Power cards played
into this Battle are discarded. Once a player passes, he can no longer participate in the current Battle.
The last player to pass in a Battle may take a second Power card played into the battle back into his hand. He also takes the Angriest
Monster card and places it on the table in front of himself.
If only one player battles for a city, that player is the Angriest Monster.
If all players pass on a City card, remove the card from the game. The player with the Angriest Monster card selects another city and again passes or plays.
If a player has no Power cards in his hand, he
must pass.
If a player is unable (or unwilling) to add enough Power to exceed the highest Monster’s Power Level, he must pass.
Players keep any card sets played into the Battle face-up in front of themselves until they either win or pass.

Battle Example
Michael holds the Angriest Monster card, so he selects Sao Paulo as the next City. Sao Paulo is worth 4 Victory
Points.Michael’s Monster, Ahefu, has 3 Electrical, 6 Toxic, 2 Radioactive and 1 Fire Power.
Michael opens the Battle for Sao Paulo by laying a set of Electricity cards — a 1 and a 3. The sum of 1 and 3 is
4, multiplied by 2 cards is 8 Power. He sets his Power Dial to 8.

Play proceeds around the table, with each player laying enough Power to beat the previous player’s Power Level. When it comes back to Michael, he needs to beat 54!
Even though his Monster allows him to play one more Electricity card, he cannot, since he has already played Electricity during this Battle. Instead, he plays two other sets — Toxic and Radioactive. He can play 6 Toxic and 2 Radioactive cards. Michael only has 5 Toxic cards in his hand, but he really wants Sao Paulo, so is willing to spend one of his precious Power Boost cards.The Power Boost does not count as a card for his 6-card Toxic limit or the multiplier.
Michael’s new Power Level is 8 Electricity plus 55 Toxic plus 8 Radioactive, for a total of 71! If bidding went around another round, Michael could still play Fire,but he’s limited to only 1 card. No other players can (or wish to) beat 71 though, so Michael wins Sao Paulo!

Ending the Battle Phase After the Battle has been
completed, all players set their power levels back to 0 on their Power Dial. The player with the Angriest Monster card selects the next City card and starts the next Battle by either playing Power card(s) or passing.
Ending the Round
If there are no more face-up City cards, or no players have Power cards left, the Round ends. Remove any remaining City cards from the game. Begin a new Round by dealing six more City cards face-up to the table.
Players discard their unused Power cards, and all of the Power cards are shufled.
Deal 12 Power cards to each player and do another Power card draft.

After the third Round, the game is over.
WINNING THE GAME
After three rounds have been played, the player with the highest total number of Victory points on the City cards wins! If two or more players are tied, the player who has won the most City cards is the winner. If two or more of the tied players have the same number of City cards, they share the win.
ADVANCED RULES
After playing RARRR!! a few times, players can feel free to add in any of the advanced rules below.
Bonus Scoring
The city cards are colored by group. Each color group also has a symbol (e.g. rice bowl for Asia/red). At the end of the game, players score bonus points for collecting Cities of the same group:
• 1: No Bonus
• 2: 1 Bonus Point
• 3+: 2 Bonus Points Players also score bonus
points for having global impact. Score as follows for each different color/symbol group:
• 1 Group: No Bonus
• 2 Groups: 1 Bonus Point • 3 Groups: 2 Bonus Points • 4 Groups: 4 Bonus Points
• 5+ Groups: 8 Bonus Points Adding Power Cards of a Different Type to a Set
Power cards can be played face-down into a set. These cards add 0 to the sum, but are used in the multiplier. Face-down power cards are played sideways into the set. They

count against the Monster’s set size limit.
Example: This set has a Power value of 20 (3 + 2 + 0 + 0) * 4.










Power Resistance
Each City card shows a resistance to one Power type. Players can play one fewer card of that Power type into a set.
Example: In the Sao Paulo Bat-tle example earlier in these rules, Michael could only play 5 Toxic cards even though his Monster’s limit is 6, since Sao Paulo has a resistance to Toxic Power.
