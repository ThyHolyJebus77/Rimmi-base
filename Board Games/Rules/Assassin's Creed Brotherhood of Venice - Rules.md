## Condensed Rules Summary

1. Setup: 
   - Arrange map tiles and place tokens as shown in the mission instructions.
   - Each player selects an assassin character and takes their board, miniature, and starting equipment.

2. Game Round:
   Each round has 3 phases: Event, Assassin, and Enemy.

3. Key Phases:
   a) Event: Draw and read an event card, following its instructions.
   
   b) Assassin: Players take turns using action points (AP) to:
      - Move (1 AP)
      - Attack enemies (1 AP)
      - Hide bodies (1 AP)
      - Complete mission objectives (1-3 AP)
      - Use equipment (varies)
   
   c) Enemy: 
      - New enemies appear on the map
      - Existing enemies move towards exposed assassins
      - Enemies attack nearby exposed assassins

4. Important Concepts:
   - Stealth: Assassins are either hidden (incognito) or visible (exposed)
   - Detection: Roll dice when entering an area with enemies while hidden
   - Combat: Roll dice to attack. Assign hits to enemies to defeat them

5. Winning:
   Complete all mission objectives and have at least one assassin escape the map using a fast travel point.

6. Key Tips:
   - Stay hidden when possible to avoid enemy attention
   - Manage your action points carefully
   - Work together with other players to complete objectives
   - Use equipment and special abilities strategically

7. Health and Recovery:
   - Each assassin has health points (HP)
   - Lose HP when hit by enemies
   - If HP reaches zero, the assassin is critically wounded and can't act
   - Use medicine or abilities to heal

8. Equipment:
   - Assassins can carry and use various equipment
   - Equipment provides special abilities or bonuses
   - Some equipment is limited use, so use wisely

9. Saving Action Points:
   - You can save 1 unused AP for later use
   - Saved AP can be used during your turn or enemy phase

10. Alert Level:
    - The game has two alert levels: normal and high
    - High alert means more enemies and easier detection
    - Certain actions or failed stealth checks raise the alert level

11. Mission Objectives:
    - Each mission has specific objectives to complete
    - Objectives are usually marked on the map
    - Some objectives require spending AP to complete

12. Between Missions:
    - Manage your headquarters
    - Upgrade assassins' abilities
    - Craft new equipment
    - Prepare for the next mission

Remember, the goal is to work together, stay stealthy when possible, and complete your objectives. Don't be afraid to take risks, but always have a backup plan. Good luck, Assassins!

# Assassin's Creed Brotherhood of Venice - Rules

[[Assassins Creed Brotherhood of Venice.pdf]]

## SETUP

See the current memory for setup instructions. Place the compass
near the map and orient it as shown. Place the map tiles, tokens,
and miniatures as shown. You can place any tile of a given type
as long as its type and orientation match. Always play with the
8 reinforcement cards that have an icon that matches the total
number of assassins in play.

## GAME TURN

### 1. EVENT PHASE

Place 3 on the grouped slots of each assassin’s board.

Draw 1 event card (regardless of the number of assassins in
play). Read it aloud, then place it next to the map. The card's
effect takes place immediately unless it states otherwise, and
only applies during the turn in which it was drawn (however, any
change to a map persists until the memory is completed).

If the event deck runs out, shuffle the discards to form a new deck.

### 2. ASSASSIN PHASE

Assassins use their to perform actions in any order desired.
You can alternate between players as you perform actions, and
you can perform the same action more than once. Remove each
from your assassin’s board as it is used.

At the end of the phase, remove any left in the 3 grouped slots
on your assassin board (not saved ).

### 3. ENEMY PHASE

You can use 1 saved before or after one of these enemy steps.

#### 1. ENEMY REINFORCEMENT

There are 2 types of guards: crossbowmen and elites.

Draw 1 reinforcement card and select the column that
corresponds to the alert state. Take the number of guards of the
indicated type from the reserve and place them on each square in
contact with an enemy entrance token matching the letter.

Ignore any reinforcements associated with enemy entrances that
are not on the map. Also ignore reinforcements that cannot enter
because the square is full. If an enemy entrance token is placed
behind a wall, the guards can still enter.

If there are not enough miniatures to place all the reinforcements,
the memory is failed.

#### 2. ENEMY MOVEMENT

Any enemy that is nearby a square containing any red bases
moves into that square.

If there is not enough space on the destination square to
accommodate all the enemies, choose which ones will not enter.
If enemies are nearby several appropriate destination squares,
you decide which square they move to.

Then, all the enemies that have not yet moved move 1 square
(unless otherwise indicated on the enemy card) in the direction
indicated on the event card drawn at the start of the turn: N, S, E

```
or W. If the direction on the event card is ?, Check a random card
halfway through the event deck until you get a direction, then
move enemies 1 square in that direction.
```
```
When moving enemies, first move those who are on the row of
squares closest to the direction shown by the event card. Then
move those on the row of squares that is in contact with the
previous row, and so on until all have been moved.
```
```
Guards on a square containing an objective base that has any
unoccupied spaces are immediately placed on those spaces.
```
```
After performing all enemy movements, resolve detection tests.
An enemy does not move if:
```
- A wall blocks their movement.
- The square they are headed to already contains 4 enemies.
- There are no ladders between street and roof squares
    (some elite guards do not need ladders).
- They are on one of the 3 spaces of an objective base.
- They are on a square containing one or more red bases
    (even if they are not attached to a miniature).

```
If a card states to move 1+ guards, it must always be done
following the above rules, unless the card states otherwise.
```
#### 3. ENEMY COMBAT

```
When assassins/allies are exposed, all nearby enemies
simultaneously make 1 attack targeting the square where the
assassins/allies are located. Each enemy can perform a maximum
of 1 attack during the enemy combat step. Each attack is
performed in this order:
```
##### 1. DETERMINE THE TARGET SQUARE

```
Each group of enemies on the same square targets, in order of
priority:
```
1. Their own square.
2. One nearby square provided they have a weapon equipped.
    If any or all of the enemies can shoot at several squares
    containing exposed assassin /allies, players decide which
    square is targeted (each group can only target 1 single square).

##### 2. ATTACK

```
For each square, take as many black dice as shown on each
attacking enemy’s card. If there are several exposed assassins/
allies on the targeted square, split the dice evenly between them.
If an equal split is not possible, players decide how to allocate the
remaining dice. Then roll the dice for each targeted assassin/ally:
```
```
= 1 hit. = Fail.
```
```
Each removes 1 from the targeted assassin/ally.
If an assassin/ally is reduced to critical condition, any remaining
that should have been allocated to them are lost.
```
## 4. END OF TURN PHASE

```
Check if the memory is a success or a failure.
```
```
As long as there are any assassins on the map and/or any
objectives to complete, start a new game turn.
```
```
Discard the current event card and remove from play any red
bases that aren’t attached to a miniature.
```
### A MEMORY IS SUCCESSFUL AS SOON AS:

- All memory objectives have been completed and
- At least 1 assassin has left the map using a fast travel station
    and
- No assassin is left on the map.

```
When these conditions occur, the game turn ends immediately
(do not play the enemy phase).
```
```
Turn the page of the memory you just played in the campaign
book to discover its conclusion and receive your rewards.
```
### A MEMORY IS FAILED AS SOON AS:

- All assassins have been eliminated or
- The memory included a failure condition that was met or
- There are not enough miniatures left to place all the guards
    when required (this also applies if any of your characters are
    wearing a guard uniform).

## ASSASSIN ACTIONS

## MOVE (1 )

```
Move to a nearby square.
Nearby squares are the square in which the character is located
and those in orthogonal contact with it, as long as they are not
separated by a wall (thick black line). The start and destination
squares can be of any type.
```
## TRADING (1 )

```
When an assassin trades, all assassins in the square in which they
are located can take, give or trade equipment cards at will.
```
## COMPLETING AN OBJECTIVE (1-3 )

```
Any assassin on a square with an objective token can complete
it by spending as many as the number on the token. Several
assassins can combine their to complete an objective, but all
the must be spent during the same game turn.
```
```
An assassin can complete an objective on their square if they are
incognito. If they are exposed, they can complete it only if there
are no enemies on their square.
```
```
After completing an objective, flip the token and keep it near you
until the end of the memory. Then remove the objective base.
```
## USE A FAST TRAVEL STATION (1 )

```
Any assassin on a square containing a fast travel station can
spend 1 to leave the map. You then have 2 options:
```
1. Go to the next memory: Place your assassin on the table
    (outside of the map) while waiting to set up the next map.
    Assassins who have left the map cannot do anything, nor are
    they affected by anything.
2. Return to the game for 0 : Place your assassin on the square
    of your choice containing a fast travel station (on the map they
    just left, or on another).

```
The assassin keeps everything they owned when they entered the
fast travel station.
```
```
Assassin/allies that are incognito can use fast travel stations.
Those that are exposed can use one only if there are no enemies
on the square where it is located (leave their red base on the
square). Enemies cannot use fast travel stations.
```
```
When more than 1 fast travel station is on a map, each assassin
can use any to enter or to exit the map.
```
## USE A WEAPON (1 )

### 1. AIM

```
Designate 1 square within range:
The square where the attacker is located.
A nearby square.
```
### 2. ATTACK

```
Roll as many assassin dice as shown on the weapon’s card.
= 1 hit.
= 1 and triggers the weapon’s special ability.
= Failure and enemy retaliation.
```
### 3. WEAPON’S SPECIAL ABILITY

```
The weapon’s special ability is triggered once only per attack.
Any on another dice is considered a. Add the effect of the
special ability to the current attack (it is not a new attack).
```
### 4. ASSIGN

```
Assign the to enemies on the target square as desired. Each
enemy that has received a number of equal to the total of
on their card is eliminated. Lay down each eliminated enemy
miniature: they are now bodies.
```
```
If the total is less than the enemy’s total , their armor
absorbs the attack and nothing happens. If there are more
than wounds to allocate, they are lost (they cannot hit enemies
on other squares).
An assassin’s attack cannot hit another assassin.
```
### 5. ALERT STATE AND STATUS CHANGE

```
Apply the effect of these icons if they are on the card of the
weapon used:
The assassin/ally becomes exposed.
Attach a red base onto their miniature.
The alert is triggered. Flip the alert state token to.
```
### 6. RETALIATION

```
If you rolled any and there is at least 1 living enemy remaining
on the targeted square, the assassin becomes exposed if
they were incognito (the alert is triggered) and is immediately
subjected to 1 retaliation: each enemy present on the target
square performs 1 attack on the assassin who just attacked.
```
```
Only assassins that took part in the attack that caused the
retaliation are subjected to it. Enemies equipped with a can
retaliate from a distance.
```
### COORDINATED ATTACK

```
Assassins can combine their and/or attacks to make a
coordinated attack. Each participating assassin spends 1.
Choose a target square within range, then each participating
player rolls their dice. Choose how to assign the results to the
enemies on the targeted square. If there is a retaliation, share the
dice as evenly as possible among all the exposed assassins who
participated in the coordinated attack, then roll them.
```
## HIDING AND SEARCHING BODIES (1 )

```
Assassins on a square containing one or more bodies can hide
all the bodies by spending 1.
```
```
An incognito assassin can hide bodies on their square. An
exposed assassin can hide bodies only if there are no enemies on
their square.
```
```
If you want to search the bodies, draw and reveal, one by one,
as many equipment cards as there are bodies to hide. You
can stop drawing cards whenever you want. As soon as you
draw an investigation card, apply its effect and stop searching
immediately.
```
```
Remove all the bodies from the square, even if the search was
interrupted by an investigation card, and return them to the
enemy reserve. Then choose to discard or keep the equipment
cards on your assassin board.
```
```
If the equipment deck runs out, shuffle the discards to form a
new deck.
```
## EQUIP (0-1 )

```
When you collect new equipment cards or cards of another
type that you want to keep, place them on the corresponding
slot ( , , or ) or on one of the 5 slots of your assassin
board. Adding any equipment card to an available slot does not
cost any. If the required slot is already occupied, you have
these options:
```

1 Move a card that is in a , , or slot to an
unoccupied slot in your inventory.

1 Perform the trade action with any assassins on your square
(or for 0 if they are the one who spent 1 to perform the
trade).

0 Discard the card that is in the slot. A card with the icon
is permanently discarded from the game.

## SAVE 1 (1 )

When setting up maps from memory 0.3 onward, place a 4th
next to each assassin board.

When you save 1 of your 3 , place it on the slot with the + icon
on your board. Each assassin can save 1 at most. It stays there
until you decide to use it (though you must discard it at the end
of the current memory). You can use 1 that you have saved in
either of these situations:

- During an assassin phase.
- During an enemy phase, before or after one of the 3 enemy
    steps.

At the start of the next game turn, collect your 3 as usual: If
you have saved 1 , you will have a total of 4 on your board.

## THE MAP

### HIDING SPOT

One and one only assassin/ally on a square with a hiding spot can
enter that spot for 0. Place the miniature on that spot.

An assassin/ally on a square with an empty hiding spot can enter
it if they are incognito. If they are exposed, they can hide there
only if there are no enemies on their square (they then become
incognito: leave their red base on the square).

An assassin/ally in a hiding spot does not undergo detection tests
when any enemies enter the square they are on.

An assassin in a hiding spot can perform the following actions
(the first 3 actions do not require them to exit the hiding spot):

- Attack with their hidden blade.
    (You cannot attack from a hiding spot with a or .)
- Hide the bodies of enemies that were eliminated on their
    square.
- Use equipment.
- Leave their hiding spot for 0. Place their miniature on the
    square where the hiding spot is located. If any enemies are
    present, perform a detection test.

### TOWER

An assassin located on one of the 4 squares around a tower can
spend 1 to climb it and place their miniature at the top (if an
assassin isn’t already there). The top of a tower is not a square,
nor is it a roof.

An assassin can climb a tower if they are incognito. If they are
exposed, they can do so only if there are no enemies on their
square (they then become incognito: leave their red base on their
starting square).

An assassin at the top of a tower can spend 1 (once per map)
to synchronize and reveal new elements on the map: flip the large
card showing a tower.

An assassin at the top of a tower is always incognito and cannot
attack. To leave the tower, perform a leap of faith for 0 and
place the assassin on the hiding spot (cart or haystack) located
at the foot of the tower. If any enemies are present on the square
where the hiding spot is located, perform a detection test before
entering the hiding spot. If this test fails, the assassin is exposed:
clip a red base to the miniature and place it on the square outside
the hiding spot.

### CHEST

```
Assassins on a square containing a chest can spend 1 to
open it: take the card on top of the chest deck, remove the chest
miniature from the map and take 1 chest token (flip it and keep it
near you until the end of the memory).
```
```
An assassin can open a chest if they are incognito. If they are
exposed, they only open it if there are no enemies on their square.
```
### CANAL

```
A canal square is split into 2 zones: in and out of the water.
Assassins/allies on a canal square always have to be placed in
the water and cannot use weapons with the icon, nor specific
bulky weapons (see their cards).
```
```
Enemies on a canal square are always placed outside of the water
(eg, on a dock or on a gondola). They can attack unhindered.
```
## STEALTH

### INCOGNITO AND EXPOSED

```
An incognito assassin/ally has no red base. Enemies do not see
them and they cannot be targeted.
```
```
Enemies that are nearby an exposed assassin/ally will move
towards them and attack them as soon as they can.
```
```
An assassin/ally automatically becomes exposed:
```
- If any enemies have successfully performed a detection test
    against them.
- As soon as they use a weapon or equipment with a.
- As soon as they are subject to a retaliation.

```
Clip a red base to the assassin/ally miniature (in place of the
assassin’s color base). If there already is a red base on the
assassin’s square, clip that to the miniature.
```
```
Any assassin/ally who becomes exposed immediately triggers
the alert state.
```
```
To become incognito again, an exposed assassin/ally must move
to a square without any enemies. Then, detach the red base from
the miniature, place it on their arrival square and recover your
own color base.
```
```
Assassins can also also use a card that allows someone to become
incognito.
```
```
A red base that isn’t clipped to any miniatures represents the last
known position of an assassin/ally who was exposed.
```
```
At the end of each turn, remove from the map any red bases that
aren't attached to a miniature.
```
```
If the assassin does not move or use any cards, they remain
exposed, even if there are no enemies left on their square or on
the map.
```
### DETECTION TEST

```
As soon as an incognito assassin/ally moves to a square
containing any enemies, perform a detection test before doing
anything else.
```
```
Similarly, any enemies who move to a square containing any
assassins/allies who are incognito immediately perform 1
detection test.
Each involved player rolls as many dice as there are enemies on
the square of their assassin/ally:
```
```
No icons The assassin stays incognito.
```
```
1+ The assassin becomes exposed and the alert state
immediately becomes.
```
```
1+ The assassin becomes exposed only if the alert state
is already. If the alert state is , the assassin
remains incognito.
```
### ALERT STATE

```
As soon as the alert is triggered, flip the alert state token to its red
side ( ). Enemy reinforcements become more numerous, and
during each detection test, assassins become exposed if you roll
any and/or on dice.
```
```
The alert state remains even if all the assassins/allies become
incognito again or if there are no assassins left on the map. The
only way to stop the alert state is to play a specific card.
```
```
Only the assassins/allies who triggered the alert become exposed.
Assassins/allies can become incognito again even when the alert
state is.
```
## ASSASSINS’ HEALTH

### FULL HEALTH

```
An assassin/ally who has all their is in full health.
```
### INJURED

```
An assassin/ally is injured when they have lost any but still
have at least 1.
```
### CRITICAL CONDITION

```
An assassin/ally is in critical condition when there are no longer
any on their board. Lay their miniature down and remove their
red base from the map. They cannot do anything.
Assassins/allies in critical condition must be healed. They will
then go back to full health status if they recover all their , or
to injured status if not. They can then immediately use their if
they have any left, otherwise they will have to wait until the start
of the next turn’s event phase to collect their 3. Assassins in
critical condition recover 3 at the start of the event phase as
usual (though they cannot use them while in critical condition).
```
```
An assassin on the same square as an assassin in critical
condition can perform a trade action with the latter if they agree.
```
### ELIMINATED

```
If no one comes to heal an assassin/ally who is in critical condition
before the end of the next game turn, they are eliminated. Put
their assassin card, card and level III and IV skill cards (if they
have any) inside a plastic bag. Remove the eliminated assassin
miniature from the map and place it near you.
```
```
The eliminated assassin will not be able to participate in the next
memory: you will have to play as an assassin apprentice instead.
```
```
Assassins who cannot leave a map are also eliminated.
```
### ASSASSIN APPRENTICES

```
Eliminated assassins are replaced by an assassin apprentice at
the beginning of the next memory. They can perform the same
actions as an assassin.
```
```
Take an assassin apprentice miniature. If you have the
headquarters (HQ), take this miniature during the assignment
step when you place the eliminated assassin in the hospital. You
will then have 1 assassin apprentice less to place in your HQ.
```
```
On your board, place:
```
- The corresponding assassin apprentice card,
- 3 + those of their armor,
- 3 +1 to the side (from memory 0.3 onwards),
- On the , , and slots, the cards chosen from those
    available to you (usually those of the eliminated assassin or
    those in the villa/HQ). An assassin apprentice cannot use.
- The eliminated assassin’s level I and II skill cards. An assassin
    apprentice cannot use level III or IV skill cards.

```
If you don’t have your HQ yet, your assassin will be in full
health as soon as you complete the memory with the assassin
apprentice. You can then recover the assassin with all their.
```
## ENEMIES

```
There can never be more than 4 enemies and/or bodies on a
square.
If enemies have to enter a square containing bodies and there are
not enough spaces to accommodate them all, remove as many
bodies as necessary (return them to the enemy reserve) and
perform a detection test for those bodies.
```
### HUNT

```
Whenever an exposed assassin leaves a square containing any
enemies, they are immediately hunted by half of them (round up).
Choose which enemies participate in the hunt among those who
can move. A guard on an objective space or on a square with any
red bases does not move.
```
```
As long as an assassin is hunted, they cannot be incognito.
Enemies stop the hunt as soon as they can no longer move.
```
```
An exposed assassin cannot use a fast travel station, climb a
tower, or open a chest if there are any enemies on their square.
Enemies cannot hunt an assassin who is using a piece of
equipment that lets them glide.
```
### BOSS

```
When you face a boss, place a number of corresponding to the
number of assassins on the map (including apprentice assassins)
on the boss’s card.
```
```
A boss moves, performs detection tests and fights in the same
way as guards, unless their card specifies otherwise (though rules
referring specifically to guards do not apply to a boss).
When hit, the boss loses 1 if they take a number of at
least equal to the total of remaining on their card. A boss is
eliminated when you remove their last. Their body can be
searched and hidden, unless the boss card says otherwise.
```
```
The number in the hexagon next to the boss’s name is the amount
of XP you gain at the end of the memory after eliminating them.
```
## REPLAYING A MEMORY

```
If you have failed a memory, you have a second chance to
complete it:
```
- Keep the equipment cards on your assassin boards. Do not
    recover those that were discarded during the first attempt.
- Remove any from the + slots of the assassin boards.
- Return any chest cards you collected during your first attempt
    to the chest card deck (in their original order).

```
When you replay the memory, set the map up once again as if
you were playing it for the first time. Restore the tiles, enemy
miniatures and tokens to their original state. The assassins restart
the memory with the left at the end of their first attempt. Each
eliminated assassin is replaced by an assassin apprentice.
```
```
Before restarting the memory, you can trade equipment between
assassins, equip yourself, deposit an /or remove equipment stored
in the villa or the HQ (without using any ).
```
```
If you fail a second time, read the Synchronized Memory page at
the back of the current memory and act as if you had completed
it but:
```
- Do not keep any chest cards from this memory (put them back
    on top of the chest deck).
- Do not place any 100% sync stickers.
- Only receive XP from mandatory objectives.
Then continue the campaign.


## COLLAPSE

At the end of the turn in which a collapse occurs, remove the
tile indicated in the memory. At the end of each subsequent
turn, remove all tiles in contact with those previously removed.
Also remove those that are no longer in contact with any tile.
Miniatures on each removed tile are eliminated (enemies go back
to their reserve).

To locate the tiles that will disappear, place a yellow reminder
token on each of them at the beginning of each game turn in
which a collapse occurs.

## ESCORT

When assassins complete an objective where they have to escort
an ally, replace the objective token with the matching mini. An
escorted ally does not have. An escorted ally can:

- Follow any assassin on their square each time the assassin
    moves or uses a fast travel station (in the latter case, remove
    the escorted character from the game).
- Hide in a hiding spot.
- Be exposed or incognito, under the same conditions as the
    assassins.
- Perform a coordinated attack with assassins on their square
    provided there are dice on their character card. The
    escorted ally becomes exposed if a icon is on their card
    and they may have to incur a if required.
- Go into critical condition if they have any on their card and
    lose all of them. If no one heals them before the end of the next
    turn, they are eliminated.

An escorted ally cannot:

- Climb up to or down from a roof without a ladder;
- Climb a tower;
- Benefit from the special ability of the assassin escorting them.

## DIFFICULTY LEVEL

You can choose the game’s difficulty level (normal or easy) before
starting a memory or during play.

Normal difficulty: Apply the game’s regular rules. For each 100%
sync won when playing through a memory entirely in normal
difficulty, stick the red version of the sticker in the Diary of
Memories.

Easy difficulty: When attacking enemies, ignore the retaliation
rule for crossbowmen only. For each 100% sync won by playing
through all or part of a memory in easy difficulty, stick the gray
version of the 100% sync in the Diary of Memories.

## OPTIONAL MEMORY

Optional memories allow you to learn more about the past of your
assassins and get specific reward cards, a 100% sync, and a
second chance to obtain a chest that you missed.

You may choose whether you play an optional memory when it is
offered to you, or to ignore it for good (in which case, continue the
campaign by playing the next memory).

When playing an optional memory, continue playing with all cards
and miniatures acquired or unlocked during the campaign.

## TIME LIMIT

When a memory must be completed in a limited number of
turns, create an event deck with a number of cards equal to that
number. Use this deck to count the number of turns left, setting
aside unused event cards. If you draw an event card with a ?,
use the deck of event cards that were set aside to determine the
direction in which the enemies will move.

```
If the memory does not end once the time limit is reached, play
subsequent turns by drawing event cards from the deck that was
set aside.
```
## LEONARDO DA VINCI’S MACHINES

```
For 0 , 1 exposed or incognito assassin on the same square
as an unoccupied machine can climb into it. A machine can
accommodate a maximum of 1 character.
```
```
Exiting it costs 1 : place your miniature on the machine’s
square (perform 1 detection test if any enemies are present).
```
```
An assassin inside a machine is incognito. They can only carry
out actions specific to the machine by using their own. They
cannot use their special ability or skills, and cannot benefit from
those of other assassins.
```
```
Place as many on the machine’s card as the number given.
A machine loses 1 only when it targeted by an attack with a
number of at least equal to the number of remaining on
its card. When you remove its last , the machine is eliminated
(remove it from the map). If an assassin was inside, leave their
miniature incognito on the square where the machine was
eliminated (perform 1 detection test if any enemies are present).
```
```
When an enemy attack targets a machine containing an assassin,
all are allocated to the machine. If any exposed assassins are
on the square of a machine that is not controlled by a guard,
the enemies’ are split equally between the machine and the
assassins. Enemies never attack a machine containing a guard.
```
```
When a machine attacks with dice and rolls one or more ,
the surviving enemies on the target square retaliate as usual.
```
```
A machine does not occupy a space on a square (4 enemies can
enter it as usual), but the guard aboard a machine occupies 1 of
the square’s spaces.
```
## RESTRICTED AREA

```
In the campaign booklet, each square on a map containing a red
restricted token is a restricted area.
Any assassin who enters a restricted area and one or more
enemies becomes exposed (without a detection test), and the
alert is triggered as usual.
```
```
When one or more enemies enter a restricted area containing any
bodies/assassins/allies, the latter become automatically exposed
(even if they are in a hiding spot) and the alert state becomes.
```
## TWO MAPS SIDE BY SIDE

```
When playing on 2 maps side by side, flip the enemy board to the
side with the letters A and B, then place it between the 2 maps,
with the letter A next to map A and the letter B next to map B.
Ensure both maps face N. Place the second alert state token,
side up, on its dedicated space.
In the event phase, draw 1 event card for each map and apply its
effect to the corresponding map.
In the enemy phase, when both maps are in play, reinforcements
enter only on the map pointed to by the white triangle on the back
of the card on top of the enemy reinforcement deck. Play the
enemy movement and combat steps as usual on both maps. The
enemy phase must always be played, even if no assassin is on a
map where there are still objectives to accomplish.
You can use a fast travel station to move to another fast travel
station, even if it is on a different map.
As soon as one of the maps no longer contains objectives nor
assassins, dismantle it as normal. During each subsequent turn,
reinforcements enter the other map until the end of memory.
```
```
An alert triggered on one map does not automatically trigger an
alert on the other map.
```

## CAMPAIGN

Each time you successfully complete a memory, if you complete
the optional 100% sync objective, place the corresponding sticker
on its spot in the Diary of Memories. If you were playing in easy
mode, place the gray version of the sticker.

Every 100% sync unlocked in a campaign is valid for all the
campaigns you played before. You can place the matching sticker
on their diaries as well.

The Diary of Memories records your progress through the
campaign. After each completed memory, total the XP you gained
(from objective tokens, boss cards, etc.), add it to your previous
total, and circle the new total on the experience track.

### VILLA

At the end of memories 0.1-0.3, keep the cards and the 3 on
your assassin boards. Recover your lost (your 3 initial and
those added by your armor if you are wearing it). Before starting
the next memory, you can freely trade and equip equipment, and
can store or recover unused equipment from the villa envelope.

### ADJUSTING THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS

Between 2 memories (never during one), you can change the
number of assassins of a campaign that is in progress.

When an assassin joins the campaign:

- If your assassins are level 0, take the new assassin’s card from
    its envelope, as well as 4 (3 if playing memory 0.1 or 0.2)
    and 3.
- If your assassins are level I or higher, from the assassin’s
    plastic bag, take the assassin card matching the level of the
    other assassins already in play, their skill card(s), and 4.
- Equip the assassin with the cards of your choice from the villa
    envelope or from your HQ (if you have one).

When an assassin leaves the campaign:

- Put their assassin card, , remaining , and skill cards inside
    a plastic bag. Place all the equipment and reward cards that
    were on their assassin board in the villa envelope or in the main
    hall of your HQ (if you have one).

You can also swap your assassin for another during the campaign
by following the above rules, but you cannot swap an apprentice
for an assassin this way.

### LEVELING UP AND SKILLS

Each time you reach or pass a level I, II, III or IV space on the
experience track in the Diary of Memories, all assassins (including
those not in play), level up.

To display the level reached, turn over each assassin’s card or
take it from their envelope and swap it with the one on their board.
If the assassin is not in play or is in the HQ’s hospital, place the
card in the assassin’s plastic bag.

Take the 3 skill cards matching the new level out of each
assassin’s envelope, choose one, and place it on the
corresponding slot of their assassin board (leave the other 2
inside their envelope). If the assassin is not in play, place the card
in their plastic bag.

```
An assassin apprentice cannot use level III or IV skill cards (place
them in their plastic bag).
```
```
Skill cards can be used at the time indicated on the card or at
any time if not indicated. You can play several at the same time.
The effect of a skill card only applies to the assassin who owns
it, unless specified otherwise. If a skill card has ‘Lvl. I, II, III or IV
headquarters required’ written on it, you can pick the card, but to
use it, your HQ must be at the indicated level.
```
## HEADQUARTERS

```
The headquarters (HQ) board is placed on the table when it is
unlocked, and consists of several buildings, each of which has
spaces on which you place the miniatures that will operate it.
Management of the HQ takes place during the assignment step
before each memory, and the resolution step after each memory.
During the assignment and resolution steps, at any time, you may:
```
- Trade small cards between assassins (except skill cards).
- Take or store small cards in the headquarters’ main hall.
- Rearrange the cards on your assassin board.
- Use medicine to heal an assassin (discard the card).

## FIRST ASSIGNMENT

```
If this is your first time in the HQ:
```
1. Place each eliminated assassin miniature on an available red
    hospital space.
2. Place the flying machine blueprint card (collected at the end of
    memory 0.4) in the workshop.
3. Reveal contract card 1 and read it. You will play this during
    the resolution step. Do not shuffle contract cards.
4. Place all the cards contained in the villa envelope in the main
    hall , then remove the villa envelope from the game.
5. Make up 2 groups of miniatures using your assassins, the 4
    apprentices, and your 4 mercenaries/courtesans (according to
    the chosen HQ):
    The memory group will be available for the next memory.
    These miniatures make up the memory group:
    - Your assassins. Any assassin on a red hospital space is
       replaced by an assassin apprentice on the map. You can
       never replace an assassin in hospital with another assassin.
    - Ezio Auditore.
    - 1 mercenary / courtesan (according to the chosen HQ).

```
The headquarters group is assigned to the HQ:
```
- Hospital: Place 1 assassin apprentice or mercenary/
    courtesan miniature on a white space.
- Workshop: Place 1 assassin apprentice or mercenary/
    courtesan miniature there.
- Command room: Place 1 assassin apprentice or
    mercenary/courtesan miniature there.
- Shop: Place 1 assassin apprentice or mercenary /
    courtesan miniature there if you have any left.
- Assign any remaining assassin apprentice or mercenary/
    courtesan miniatures to the command room.

## ASSIGNMENTS: MEMORY 1.2 ONWARD

```
Assign your miniatures and cards in this order during each
assignment step:
```
1. Place each eliminated assassin miniature on a red hospital
    space. If you wish, you may also place any injured assassins
    there. In any case, put their assassin card, card, III and IV
    skill cards, and their remaining in a plastic bag (you recover
    them as soon as they leave the hospital).

```
Any assassin on a red hospital space will be replaced by an
assassin apprentice during the next memory.
```
2. Choose 1 blueprint card and place it in the workshop.
3. If the card on the top of the contract deck in the command
    room is facedown, reveal it. If it has a gray text box, read and
    resolve it now.

```
If this is your second attempt at fulfilling the contract, you have
to place enough miniatures in the command room to succeed.
```
4. Separate your miniatures into 2 groups: those who will
    participate in the next memory and those who will stay at HQ.
5. Assign allies and assassin apprentices from the headquarters
    group in the buildings of your choice. As indicated by the
    circles, you can have a maximum of:
    - 4 Injured or eliminated miniatures and 4 caregivers in the
       hospital.
    - 4 miniatures in the workshop and in the shop.
    - 6 miniatures in the command room.

## CALLING AN ALLY FROM THE HQ

```
Some allies can be played either in the HQ or on the map during a
memory (as indicated on their brown card).
```
```
To use the ally on the map, place their miniature on the table. A
miniature can be used multiple times as long as you have cards
available to play it.
You can place them on the map each time you use an equipment
card (mercenary/courtesan); each time you use a skill card (Ezio);
and by meeting the conditions written on the ally’s brown card.
```
## CONTRACT CARDS

```
Gray text box: To be played during the assignment step (before
the memory).
```
```
Red text box: To be played during the resolution step (after the
memory).
```
```
As long as the text in the box you read directs you to a box or card
of the same color, keep playing. Whenever you need to switch to a
box or card of a different color, wait for the next step (assignment
or resolution) to continue playing. You can always read the entire
text of a contract card, even if you can’t play it yet.
```
## HQ RESOLUTION STEP

```
When returning from a memory, resolve the effects of each
building, in this order:
```
## I. HOSPITAL

```
Each ally/assassin apprentice on a white space restores to
assassins depending on the HQ’s level (as indicated on the back
of the card located on the top of the contract deck).
```
1. Determine the number of to give back to the assassins by
    checking the brown cards of the allies/assassin apprentices
    in the hospital. Any eliminated assassin who is healed in the
    hospital returns as either injured or full health (if they have
    recovered all their ) and may take part in the next memory.
2. Remove all miniatures from the hospital.

```
Allies and assassin apprentices do not need to be healed: if they
have been injured/eliminated, they will be available with all their
for the next memory or the second attempt at a failed memory.
```
## 2. WORKSHOP

```
You can reveal and read a blueprint card before building it. If you
have placed 1 blueprint card in the workshop, you can build the
object shown by paying its manufacturing cost in small black and
white equipment, reward and special equipment cards (made
from blueprints).
```
```
A blueprint card that has not been manufactured is not
considered a white card.
```
1. Determine the number of cards needed by checking each
    brown card of the allies/assassin apprentices in the workshop.
    Used cards with a icon are permanently removed from the
    game, and those with a icon are placed in the equipment
    discard pile.
2. Remove all miniatures from the workshop.

```
Once the object is manufactured, flip the blueprint card; you can
now use it.
```
```
If you no longer wish to craft the item, put the blueprint card in
the main hall, blueprint faceup.
```
## 3. SHOP

```
Draw and reveal 4 cards from the equipment deck (ignore
investigation cards and draw other cards to replace them):
```
1. Determine the number of cards to keep by reading the brown
    card of each ally/assassin apprentice present in the shop.
2. Remove all miniatures from the shop.

```
Place the equipment cards thus acquired on the assassins’
boards and/or in the HQ’s main hall.
```
## 4. COMMAND ROOM

```
Each contract card requires a certain number of to be
completed. These contracts improve the HQ’s level (as shown on
the back of the card that is on top of the contract deck).
The HQ’s level determines the amount of health restored to
assassins and allows them to use more skill cards.
```
1. If this is your first attempt at completing the contract, find the
    number of dice to roll by reading the brown card of each
    ally/assassin apprentice in the command room.

```
Roll the dice:
If the total of (1 counts for 1 ) is greater than or equal
to the value on the contract card, you have succeeded: remove
the card from the game (). The back of the new card thus
revealed is the HQ's’ new level.
```
```
If the total is lower, you have failed: your HQ's level does not
increase and the contract remains faceup on top of the deck.
```
```
If this is your second attempt, the contract is automatically
fulfilled. However, during the assignment step, enough
miniatures had to be placed in the command room in order
to fulfill the contract. Each die that should be rolled
automatically provides a (no need to roll them).
```
2. Remove all miniatures from the command room.

## SAVING THE GAME

```
After each memory, you can pause your campaign and save the
game. If the memory was unsuccessful, first follow the steps
required after a failed memory.
In any case, follow these steps:
```
```
Assassins: Place all cards, the 4 and the remaining from
each assassin board in a plastic bag.
```
```
Headquarters: Store all cards (allies, assassin apprentices,
contract, equipment, chest, blueprints, and reward) inside the
HQ save box.
Map: Place the event, chest and equipment cards in a plastic bag.
```

## GAME TURN

### 1. EVENT PHASE

Place 3 on the grouped slots of each assassin’s board.

Draw 1 event card (regardless of the number of assassins in
play). Read it aloud, then place it next to the map.

### 2. ASSASSIN PHASE

Assassins use their to perform actions in any order desired.
At the end of the phase, remove any left in the 3 grouped
slots on your assassin board (not saved ).

### 3. ENEMY PHASE

You can use 1 saved before or after one of these steps.

#### 1. ENEMY REINFORCEMENT

Draw 1 reinforcement card and check the column that
corresponds to the alert state. Take the number of guards of the
indicated type ( ) from the reserve and place them on each
square in contact with the matching enemy entrance token.

If you cannot place all reinforcements, the memory is failed.

#### 2. ENEMY MOVEMENT

Any enemy that is nearby a square containing any red bases
moves into that square.

Then, all the enemies that have not yet moved move 1 square in
the direction indicated on the event card. If ?, Check a random
card halfway through the event deck for the direction.

Guards on a square containing an objective base that has any
unoccupied spaces are immediately placed on those spaces.

There can never be more than 4 enemies and/or bodies on a
square. If enemies have to enter a square containing bodies
and there are not enough spaces, remove as many bodies as
necessary (return them to the enemy reserve) and perform a
detection test for those bodies.

After performing all enemy movements, resolve detection tests.

#### 3. ENEMY COMBAT

When assassins/allies are exposed, all nearby enemies
simultaneously make 1 attack targeting their square. Each
enemy can perform a maximum of 1 attack per enemy combat
step. Each attack is performed in this order:

##### 1. DETERMINE THE TARGET SQUARE

Each group of enemies on the same square targets, in order of
priority, their own square, then 1 nearby square (if they have a
weapon).

##### 2. ATTACK

For each square, take the black dice as shown on each
attacking enemy’s card. If there are several exposed assassins/
allies on the targeted square, split the dice evenly between
them. Then roll the dice for each targeted assassin/ally:

```
= 1 hit. = Fail.
```
Each removes 1 from the targeted assassin/ally.

## 4. END OF TURN PHASE

Check if the memory is a success or a failure.

As long as there are any assassins on the map and/or any
objectives to complete, start a new game turn.

```
Discard the current event card and remove from play any red
bases that aren’t attached to a miniature.
```
### A MEMORY IS SUCCESSFUL AS SOON AS:

- All memory objectives have been completed and
- At least 1 assassin has left using a fast travel station and
- No assassin is left on the map.

```
When these conditions occur, the game turn ends immediately
(do not play the enemy phase).
```
### A MEMORY IS FAILED AS SOON AS:

- All assassins have been eliminated or
- The memory included a failure condition that was met or
- There are not enough miniatures left to place all the guards
    when required.

## ASSASSIN ACTIONS

### MOVE (1 )

```
Move to a nearby square.
```
### TRADING (1 )

```
All assassins in the same square can take, give or trade
equipment cards at will.
```
### COMPLETING AN OBJECTIVE (1-3 )

```
An assassin on a square with an objective token can complete it
by spending as many as the number on the token. Keep the
token, then remove the objective base.
```
```
The assassin must be incognito. An exposed assassin can
complete it only if there are no enemies on their square.
```
### USE A FAST TRAVEL STATION (1 )

```
Any assassin on a square containing a fast travel station can
spend 1 to leave the map. You may then go to the next
memory or return to the game for 0.
The assassin/ally must be incognito. An exposed assassin/ally
can use one only if there are no enemies on the square (leave
their red base on the square).
```
### USE A WEAPON (1 )

#### 1. AIM

```
Designate 1 square within range:
The square where the attacker is located.
```
```
A nearby square.
```
#### 2. ATTACK

```
Roll as many assassin dice as shown on the weapon’s card.
```
```
= 1 hit.
= 1 and triggers the weapon’s special ability.
= Failure and enemy retaliation.
```
#### 3. WEAPON’S SPECIAL ABILITY

```
The weapon’s special ability is triggered once only per attack.
Any on another dice is considered a.
```
#### 4. ASSIGN

```
Assign the to enemies on the target square as desired. Each
enemy that has received a number of equal to the total of
on their card is eliminated. Lay down each eliminated enemy
miniature: they are now bodies.
```
#### 5. ALERT STATE AND STATUS CHANGE

```
Apply these effect if the icon is on the card of the weapon:
```
```
The assassin/ally becomes exposed. Attach a red base.
The alert is triggered. Flip the alert state token to.
```
## GAME TURN

### 1. EVENT PHASE

```
Place 3 on the grouped slots of each assassin’s board.
Draw 1 event card (regardless of the number of assassins in
play). Read it aloud, then place it next to the map.
```
### 2. ASSASSIN PHASE

```
Assassins use their to perform actions in any order desired.
At the end of the phase, remove any left in the 3 grouped
slots on your assassin board (not saved ).
```
### 3. ENEMY PHASE

```
You can use 1 saved before or after one of these steps.
```
#### 1. ENEMY REINFORCEMENT

```
Draw 1 reinforcement card and check the column that
corresponds to the alert state. Take the number of guards of the
indicated type ( ) from the reserve and place them on each
square in contact with the matching enemy entrance token.
```
```
If you cannot place all reinforcements, the memory is failed.
```
#### 2. ENEMY MOVEMENT

```
Any enemy that is nearby a square containing any red bases
moves into that square.
Then, all the enemies that have not yet moved move 1 square in
the direction indicated on the event card. If ?, Check a random
card halfway through the event deck for the direction.
```
```
Guards on a square containing an objective base that has any
unoccupied spaces are immediately placed on those spaces.
```
```
There can never be more than 4 enemies and/or bodies on a
square. If enemies have to enter a square containing bodies
and there are not enough spaces, remove as many bodies as
necessary (return them to the enemy reserve) and perform a
detection test for those bodies.
```
```
After performing all enemy movements, resolve detection tests.
```
#### 3. ENEMY COMBAT

```
When assassins/allies are exposed, all nearby enemies
simultaneously make 1 attack targeting their square. Each
enemy can perform a maximum of 1 attack per enemy combat
step. Each attack is performed in this order:
```
##### 1. DETERMINE THE TARGET SQUARE

```
Each group of enemies on the same square targets, in order of
priority, their own square, then 1 nearby square (if they have a
weapon).
```
##### 2. ATTACK

```
For each square, take the black dice as shown on each
attacking enemy’s card. If there are several exposed assassins/
allies on the targeted square, split the dice evenly between
them. Then roll the dice for each targeted assassin/ally:
```
```
= 1 hit. = Fail.
```
```
Each removes 1 from the targeted assassin/ally.
```
## 4. END OF TURN PHASE

```
Check if the memory is a success or a failure.
As long as there are any assassins on the map and/or any
objectives to complete, start a new game turn.
```
```
Discard the current event card and remove from play any red
bases that aren’t attached to a miniature.
```
## A MEMORY IS SUCCESSFUL AS SOON AS:

- All memory objectives have been completed and
- At least 1 assassin has left using a fast travel station and
- No assassin is left on the map.

```
When these conditions occur, the game turn ends immediately
(do not play the enemy phase).
```
## A MEMORY IS FAILED AS SOON AS:

- All assassins have been eliminated or
- The memory included a failure condition that was met or
- There are not enough miniatures left to place all the guards
    when required.

## ASSASSIN ACTIONS

### MOVE (1 )

```
Move to a nearby square.
```
### TRADING (1 )

by spending as many as the number on the token. Keep the
token, then remove the objective base.
```
```
The assassin must be incognito. An exposed assassin can
complete it only if there are no enemies on their square.
```
### USE A FAST TRAVEL STATION (1 )

```
Any assassin on a square containing a fast travel station can
spend 1 to leave the map. You may then go to the next

The alert is triggered. Flip the alert state token to.
```

#### 6. RETALIATION

```
If you rolled any and there is at least 1 living enemy left
on the targeted square, the assassin is exposed if they were
incognito (trigger the alert) and is immediately subjected to 1
retaliation: each enemy present on the target square performs 1
attack on the assassin who just attacked.
```
#### COORDINATED ATTACK

```

Assassins on a square containing one or more bodies can hide
all the bodies by spending 1.
```
```
The assassin must be incognito. An exposed assassin can hide
bodies only if there are no enemies on their square.
```
```
If you want to search the bodies, draw and reveal, one by one,
as many equipment cards as there are bodies to hide. You can
stop drawing cards whenever you want. As soon as you draw an
investigation card, apply its effect and stop searching.
```
```
Remove all the bodies from the square, then choose to discard
or keep the equipment cards on your assassin board.
```
## EQUIP (0-1 )

```
When you collect new equipment cards or cards of another
type that you want to keep, place them on the corresponding
slot ( , , or ) or on one of the 5 slots of your assassin
board. Adding any equipment card to an available slot does not
cost any. If the required slot is already occupied:
```
```
1 Move a card in a , , or slot to an unoccupied
slot in your inventory.
```
```
1 Perform the trade action with any assassins on your square.
```
```
0 Discard the card that is in the slot. A card with the icon
is permanently discarded from the game.
```
## SAVE 1 (1 )

```
When you save 1 of your 3 , place it on the slot with the + icon
on your board. Each assassin can save 1 at most. You can
use 1 that you have saved either:
```

- During an enemy phase, before or after an enemy step.

## THE MAP

### HIDING SPOT

```
One assassin/ally on a square with a hiding spot can enter it
for 0 if they are incognito. If they are exposed, they do so
only if there are no enemies on their square (they then become
incognito: leave their red base on the square).
```
```
An assassin/ally in a hiding spot does not undergo detection
tests when any enemies enter their square.
```
```
The assassin can perform the following actions (the first 3
actions do not require them to exit the hiding spot):
```
- Attack with their hidden blade.
- Hide the bodies of enemies eliminated on their square.
- Use equipment.
- Leave their hiding spot for 0. If any enemies are present,
    perform a detection test.

### TOWER

```
An assassin on one of the 4 squares around a tower can spend 1
to climb it and place their miniature at the top (if an assassin
isn’t already there).
```
```
The assassin must be incognito. An exposed,assassin can climb
the tower only if there are no enemies on their square (they then
become incognito: leave their red base on their starting square).
```
```
An assassin at the top of a tower can spend 1 (once per map)
to synchronize: flip the large card showing a tower.
```
```
An assassin at the top of a tower is always incognito and cannot
attack. To leave the tower, perform a leap of faith for 0 and
place the assassin on the hiding spot at the foot of the tower. If
any enemies are present on that square, perform a detection
test before entering the hiding spot.
```
### CHEST

```
Assassins on a square containing a chest can spend 1 to
open it: take the card on top of the chest deck, remove the
chest miniature from the map and take 1 chest token.
```
```
The assassin must be incognito. An exposed assassin can open
it only if there are no enemies on their square.
```
### CANAL

```
Assassins/allies on a canal square always have to be placed
in the water and cannot use weapons, nor specific bulky
weapons. Enemies on a canal square are always placed outside
of the water, and can attack unhindered.
```
## STEALTH

### INCOGNITO AND EXPOSED

```
An assassin/ally automatically becomes exposed:
```
- If any enemies have successfully performed a detection test
    against them.
- As soon as they use a weapon or equipment with a.
- As soon as they are subject to a retaliation.
Clip a red base to the assassin/ally miniature. If there already is
a red base on the assassin’s square, clip that to the miniature.
Any assassin/ally who becomes exposed immediately triggers
the alert state.

```
To become incognito again, an exposed assassin/ally must move
to a square without any enemies. Then, detach the red base and
place it on their arrival square. Assassins can also also use a
card that allows someone to become incognito.
Whenever an exposed assassin leaves a square containing
enemies, they are hunted by half of them (round up). A guard on
an objective space or on a square with any red bases does not
move. A hunted assassin cannot be incognito.
```
### DETECTION TEST

```
As soon as an incognito assassin/ally moves to a square
containing any enemies, perform a detection test. Similarly, any
enemies who move to a square containing any assassins/allies
who are incognito immediately perform 1 detection test.
```
```
Each involved player rolls as many dice as there are enemies on
the square of their assassin/ally:
```
```
No icons The assassin stays incognito.
1+ The assassin becomes exposed and the alert state
immediately becomes.
1+ The assassin becomes exposed only if the alert
state is already. If the alert state is , the
assassin remains incognito.
```
### ALERT STATE

```
When the alert is triggered, flip the alert state token to.
It remains even if all assassins/allies become incognito
again or they have all left the map. The only way to stop the alert
state is to play a specific card.
```
```
Only assassins/allies who triggered the alert become exposed.
They can become incognito again even when the alert is.
```
### 6. RETALIATION

If you rolled any and there is at least 1 living enemy left
on the targeted square, the assassin is exposed if they were
incognito (trigger the alert) and is immediately subjected to 1
