## Quick Start Rules Guide

1. Setup:
   - Each player chooses a Hunter and takes their dashboard, weapon card, and starter deck.
   - Set up the Hunt Board with mission cards and place enemy figures on the map.
   - Put the Hunt Token on the first space of the Hunt Track.

2. Game Round:
   - Each round, every player takes one turn, then enemies activate.
   - At the start of each round, move the Hunt Token one space forward.

3. Player Turn:
   - On your turn, you can do multiple actions by discarding cards from your hand:
     a) Move up to 2 spaces
     b) Attack enemies in your space
     c) Interact with objects or pick up items
     d) Transform your weapon (flip your weapon card)
   - If you run out of health, go to the Hunter's Dream to heal and upgrade.

4. Combat:
   - To attack, place a card in an empty slot on your weapon dashboard.
   - Draw an enemy action card to see what the enemy does.
   - Compare the speed of your attack with the enemy's - faster attacks happen first.
   - You can dodge by playing a card with equal or higher speed than the enemy attack.

5. Enemy Activation:
   - After all players have taken their turns, enemies move towards the nearest Hunter.
   - If an enemy is in the same space as a Hunter, it attacks.

6. Blood Echoes and Upgrades:
   - Gain Blood Echoes by defeating enemies.
   - Visit the Hunter's Dream to spend Blood Echoes on upgrades for your deck.

7. Winning the Game:
   - Complete the main Hunt Mission before the Hunt Track reaches the final space.
   - If you fail, the campaign ends, and you must start over from the beginning.

Remember, work together as a team to explore, fight monsters, and complete missions. Good luck, Hunters!

# Bloodborne: The Board Game - Rules

## Bloodborne: The Board Game Rules Summary

#### Setup:

```
 Each player takes 1 Trick Weapon dashboard, starter Firearm card, and mini.
o 6 hp. Trick weapon either side.
o Hunter Deck (3 of each starter Stat card). Shuffle + draw 3.
 Hunt Board
o Chapter cards + Mission Deck (on side)
o Enemies from Mission/Chapter cards (if double-sided, choose randomly which side, and random location)
o Upgrade cards (shuffle deck, then 4 on hunt board)
o Consumables Deck on side (shuffle)
o Rewards Deck on side
o Hunt Token on spot 1
o Enemy Action Deck on side (shuffle)
 Tiles
o Follow Chapter/Mission cards. Random tiles can be any named or unnamed tile not already in use for that chapter.
Random Tiles are calculated by ##of players x ##stated on card (e.g. 2 players x 2 = 4).
o Central Lamp tile is start location for Hunter minis.
 Read Introduction card, then follow mission cards. Hunt Mission is main goal. Insight Missions optional.
 Winning – When Hunt Mission completed, immediately ends (see Campaign Progression).
 Losing – At start of round , if Hunt Track on final space, 1 more round to win. If fail, Campaign over ( not chapter). Restart at
beginning of Campaign!
```
#### Round:

```
 Each round is 1 turn per Hunter, any order wanted.
 Each turn is:
o 1. Hunter Turn
o 2. Enemy Activation
 Starting a New Round:
o Advance Hunt Track by 1 (Hunt Token on Hunt Board).
o If advanced onto final space, final round triggered, 1 more round allowed to win.
o If advanced onto reset space do the following (if happens instead during normal gameplay, the following
happens immediately , not just when starting new round. Also if told to advance during normal gameplay, and
already on final space, reset again):
 All non-Boss Enemies removed from map
 Replenish all Consumables on map
 Respawn all Enemies related to Missions, if any.
 Respawn all spawn points, starting with those closest to Hunters
 Bosses healed to max. Not removed from map. If Phase 2, stays Phase 2.
o All Hunters discard any Stat cards, then draw up back up to 3 Stat cards in hand (excluding first Round).
```
#### Hunter Turn:

```
 Perform actions by discarding a card into personal discard pile (if attack, goes on weapon board). No limit to ## of actions
taken. Can do same action multiple times. You can save cards for Enemy Activation.
 MOVE
o Up to 2 spaces, all at once. Cannot divide between other actions.
o If, and only if, during MOVE action a Hunter exits a space or tile w/ Enemies,
those Enemies will immediately Pursue (after the Hunter’s full movement
action completed). Those Enemies move 1 space toward Hunter, following
Hunter’s movement path exactly (so if you have a card that lets you move 3
spaces, you can use it to kite enemies around. See example ).
Other non-pursuing Enemies or Hunters don’t interfere.
o If exiting tile, draw new tile, linking exits. Populate tile w/ Consumable
tokens, and Enemies per the symbols. Then MUST put Hunter on connecting
space. If 1 move point left, can run away!
If spawning Enemy and out of its minis, move mini that is farthest from any
Hunter and use it on new tile.
```

######  INTERACT

```
o Pick up a Consumable (discard token from board, draw 1 random Consumable card. Put face up)
o Mission card Interact action.
o Can do Interact for all Consumable and Mission card available with 1 Interact Action.
o If Interact w/ Enemies on space, before Interact happens, draw Enemy Action card for each Enemy on that space.
No Attack or Dodge allowed! If slain, no Interact happens.
 TRANSFORM TRICK WEAPON
o Discard all Stat cards on Trick Weapon dashboard
o Must flip dashboard to other side
 GO TO HUNTER’S DREAM
o Turn is over if come here (voluntarily or if slain)
o Advance Hunt Track by 1 space (may cause a reset if moves onto )
o Take all Stat cards back (from deck, discard, hand, and trick weapon dashboard)
o Discard all Blood Echoes to gain Upgrades ( not optional ).
o Obtain 1 Upgrade card per discarded Blood Echo (replace available options from its deck as you go). If you were
slain, no Upgrading allowed!
o Incorporate new cards into deck, removing 1 card for each new one (always 12 card deck). If don’t want to use this
new upgrade card, remove it from game for this Chapter.
o Shuffle new deck.
o Refresh Firearm and Reward cards.

o Heal to 6 hp.
o At start of next round , draw 3 cards, choose trick weapon side, put mini on a non-broken Lamp space.
 ATTACK
o Place Stat card into empty Attack slot on Trick Weapon (if on same space as Enemy). If no empty Attack slot, you
cannot Attack (see Transform Trick Weapon)!
o (See Combat section)
```
#### Enemy Activation:

```
 After Hunter’s Turn (all actions) completed. Enemies on Hunter’s tile or on tiles connected to it will activate. Those further
away do not activate.
 All first, then all , then all.
 MOVE 1 space toward the current player’s Hunter. If already in a space with another Hunter, must move only if will end up
in current player’s Hunter’s space. Don’t move if already in current player’s Hunter’s space.
 If in same space as current player’s Hunter, ATTACK (see Combat section).
 Sometimes an Enemy that wasn’t previously in range, will be moved in range. They will activate as well even if its normal
opportunity has passed.
 If Hunter is slain before all Enemies activate, no further Enemies activate.
```
#### Consumables:

```
 One time use. Not part of deck. Discard after use.
 “Hunter’s Turn” = before or after any action
 “On Attack” = when player chooses which Attack they will use
```
#### Reward Cards:

```
 Not discarded when used. Exhaust instead (flip upside down).
 Refreshed when go to Hunter’s Dream (flip face up).
 MAX 2 Hunter’s Tools. MAX 2 Caryll Runes. If gain a 3rd of either, give to another player. If no one wants it now, put to side.
 Reward cards are kept for whole Campaign , and can be switched out between Chapters.
```
#### Firearms:

```
 Exhaust when used (flip upside down)
 Refresh either by card text –or– by going to Hunter’s Dream.
 MAX 1 at a time. If gain a new one, can swap. Place unused to side.
 Kept for whole Campaign , can switch out between Chapters. Cannot exchange a Starter Firearm with other Hunters!
```
#### Combat:

1. Select Stat card
     Place Stat card into **empty** Attack slot on Trick Weapon.
     If all slots already filled, Hunter _cannot_ Attack!
     Unless card says a timing, effects from cards happen immediately


```
 CLEAR THIS SLOT: apply immediate effects from card, then card is discarded from slot (so you could attack and
dodge with same slot potentially). The attack will still resolve, but the slot will be clear.
```
2. Flip Enemy Action card
     Basic, Special, or Ability
     Ability is not an attack. Resolved immediately (unless timing/Speed specified).
     Abilities cannot be Staggered or Dodged (unless stated).
     If Enemy Action deck empty, shuffle and draw.
3. Dodge
     If have a Dodge card in hand, may place in **empty** Attack Slot on Trick Weapon of the **same Speed or faster than**
       **Enemy Attack Speed**. (If Enemy Speed is >>, Dodge has to be placed in an empty >>> or >> slot.)
     Only that Hunter avoids the attack. Will _not_ prevent other effects like Enemy moving or damage to other Hunters.
     Does _not_ affect Hunter’s attack in any way!
     Other non-attack effects _do_ apply (e.g. draw a card, clear a slot)
     If Enemy is using an Attack that hits multiple Hunters, those hunters can _all_ play a Dodge card (same Speed or
       faster than Enemy Attack Speed)
     If Enemy attack/ability says “Dodge >,” that is a minimum Speed requirement. If it says “must Dodge at >>,” must
       dodge using attack slot of same Speed.
4. Resolve Attacks
     Resolve in Speed order >>>, then >>, then >.
       o STAGGER: cancel opposing Attack with **_slower_** Speed. Prevent all effects and damage.
       o STUN: Hunter must discard 1 Stat card. If cannot, take 1 damage.
       o POISON: Hunter gains token (MAX 1 on a Hunter). At end of Hunter Turn, take 1 damage.
          Poison Token discarded when go to Hunter’s Dream.
       o FRENZY: Hunter gains token (MAX 1 on a Hunter). Suffer +1 damage from all Attacks.
          Frenzy Token discarded when go to Hunter’s Dream.
     If same Speed, resolve _simultaneously_. Possible to cancel opposing Attack/Ability!
     “Before Hunter Attacks” would apply if had same speed. Otherwise follow regular speed rules.
     If Enemy no longer in Hunter’s space (b/c of an ability), Hunter’s attack will miss. If was same speed, would be
       simultaneous and still hit. Same reversed too (if Hunter no longer in Enemy’s space, Enemy’s attack will miss)
     If Hunter HP goes to 0, immediately slain. Discard any Blood Echoes and go to Hunter’s Dream.
     If Enemy slain, Hunter gains 1 Blood Echo (can hold MAX 3 Blood Echoes). Remove Enemy from map.
       o If Enemy and Hunter slain _simultaneously_ , remove both from map. Discard all Blood Echoes still.
     If >>> gains +1 >, treat as >>>>. If Attack Speed reduced to 0, resolve it after all other Attacks.
     If Hunter chooses not to Attack, or cannot, treat their Speed as 0.
     If a Hunter slain _before they’ve taken their turn_ for the round, just do Hunter’s Dream.

#### Boss Enemies:

```
 2 Phases, 2 Action Decks. HP scales with ## of Hunters.
 Activates after other regular 3 Enemy types.
 When suffered all HP from Phase 1 side, remove all tokens and flip to Phase 2. If Hunter’s Attack exceeds that remaining
Phase 1 HP, it does not carry to Phase 2. If goes to Phase 2 before you resolve its Phase 1 attack, resolve Phase 1 attack as
normal (not replaced with a Phase 2 attack).
```
#### NPC Enemies:

```
 Put their Enemy card to side of Hunt board. 1 side for 1-2p. 2 side for 3-4p. Token on map.
 Activates after other regular 3 Enemy types.
```
#### Fog Gates:

```
 Cover each exit on that tile. Use Broken Lamp token if there was a Lamp there.
 Remove all Enemies, except for those spawned by Mission Card that caused Fog Gates.
 Hunters may enter, but never leave except by Hunter’s Dream.
 Cannot return from Hunter’s Dream to a Broken Lamp.
 Enemies cannot enter or exit tile. If Pursuing a Hunter (during Hunter’s MOVE), stops in space adjacent to Fog Gate tile.
Enemies ignore all Hunters separated by Fog Gates when they Activate.
 Enemies not listed under that Mission card do not spawn on that tile while Fog Gates are active.
```
####  Fog Gates removed when Mission completed or told to do so. Remove Broken Lamp token. Enemies can spawn again as

#### usual via.


#### Insight:

```
 If need to “Gain Insight,” complete “Insight Missions.”
 Current Insight = ## of completed Insight Mission cards you’ve collected. Resets between chapters.
```
#### Insight Tokens:

```
 Insight tokens are just tokens to track various effects across the game. Only relevant when a Mission says to use them.
 If Enemy with Insight token that prevents being slain has HP go to 0, their Attack will continue as normal. “On Kill” or “On
Death” do not trigger. Excess damage does not carry over to new HP pool (similar to Boss Phase transition).
```
#### Intelligent and Cruel:

```
 If there is a game effect causing a choice for how it can resolve, always pick that which would be the worst possible
outcome for the players.
```
#### Campaign Progression:

```
 If complete Chapter, go to Hunter’s Dream and spend Blood Echoes to get Upgrades
 Keep acquired Upgrade cards between chapters. Cannot exchange between Hunters.
 Keep Consumables, Firearms, and Reward Cards. Can exchange between Hunters (except Starter Firearms).
 Keep Insight cards.
 Take next Chapter card and follow setup instructions.
