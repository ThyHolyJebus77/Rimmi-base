## Comparisons to Civilization 5/6
- Both games feature exploration of a map, but Merchants & Marauders focuses on naval exploration in a fixed Caribbean setting.
- Unlike Civ's tech tree, M&M progression is more about upgrading ships and gaining personal glory.
- M&M has a stronger emphasis on individual character development (your captain) compared to Civ's nation-building.
- Combat in M&M is more detailed and personal, focusing on ship-to-ship battles rather than large-scale warfare.

# Merchants & Marauders Rules

#### SETUP

Shuffle all card decks and place them facedown near the board.

Randomly place 1 demand token faceup in each sea zone (except
the Caribbean Sea), on one of the 2 square areas close to each
port. The remaining tokens are put into a facedown pile.

Randomly place a ship modification token facedown in the second
square area of each sea zone (except the Caribbean Sea).

Randomly place 1 merchant token, nationality side down, in each
sea zone (including the Caribbean Sea).

Draw 2 mission cards, read them aloud and place each on the
board in the sea zone listed on the card.

Place a cube from each player on number 0 of the glory point
track and place 5 brown cubes near the enemy table.

Each player takes a player board, chooses a color and takes their 6
cubes and miniatures, plus a chest for stashed gold.

Each player secretly draws a captain from the captain deck. Place
a ship in your hand: either a sloop (highly maneuverable and good
for piracy) or a flute (vulnerable, capable merchant vessel). All
players simultaneously reveal their captain and ship.

Take a ship card for your chosen ship and place it and your
ccaptain card on your player board. Place your chosen ship
miniature on the board in the home port of your captain.

Draw a glory card and take 10 gold. Place a cube on each hit
location, matching the values on your ship card. Hull and masts
correspond to toughness, while the other locations match the
names of the ship card values.

Take all the player’s captain cards and draw one to determine the
starting player; turns proceed clockwise from that player and this
turn order is stays the same throughout the game.

Skill checks: Roll dice equal to your captain’s appropriate skill
value. To be successful you must roll at least 1 icon.

#### TURN SEQUENCE

#### 1. DRAW EVENT CARD

Draw an event card. If the card has any NPC icons at the top,
these are resolved first. Then read the text aloud and resolve its
effect. Put the card in a discard pile unless stated otherwise.

#### 2. PLAYER ACTIONS

Players perform their actions, starting with the first player
and proceeding clockwise. On your turn you may perform up to
3 actions from among the following (you may combine actions):

## A. MOVE

Use the move action to move your ship between adjacent sea
zones or to and from ports (place it on the port). Each separate
move equals an action. All ship types move the same.

## B. SCOUT

Use the scout action to try to find and attack a ship in your sea
zone. Announce which of the following you are scouting for:

```
A player captain in the same sea zone (not in port)
An NPC in the same sea zone
A merchant (merchant token) in the same sea zone
```
Roll your captain’s SCOUTING skill. If successful, you find the
ship you scouted for and a battle takes place. You may not scout
for the same target twice during the same turn. However, you may

```
scout for another target in the same sea zone, or move to another
sea zone and scout if you have enough actions.
```
## C. PORT

```
When you are in a port you may (once per turn) take the port
action to do any number of the following:
```
```
Sell goods (must be your first port activity)
Buy goods
Visit shipyard
Recruit
Acquire a rumor
Claim a mission
Stash gold (home port only)
```
```
If you wish to sell goods then this must be your first activity; other
activities may be performed in any order desired. An activity can
only be performed once, and must be completed before a new one
can be made.
```
#### Sell goods

```
Declare which of your goods (cargo cards) you wish to sell. All
goods can be sold for the price of 3 gold per card. However, the
good in demand (shown on the demand token next to the port) can
be sold for 6 gold. Sold cargo cards are placed faceup in the cargo
card discard pile.
```
```
When you sell the good in demand, randomly replace the demand
token with a new one from the pool. After changing the token you
cannot sell any more goods that turn.
```
#### Buy goods

```
Draw the top 6 cargo cards and keep them to yourself. Discard any
cards featuring the good in demand and draw new ones to replace
them. The cards you have drawn (there are 8 different types) are
the goods available to you this turn.
```
```
The base price per cargo card is 3 gold. If you draw 2 of the same
good, the price for that good drops from 3 to 2 gold per card. If you
draw 3 or more cards of the same good, you can get that good for
just 1 gold per card.
```
```
Select which cards you wish to buy, pay their cost, and put them
facedown on your player board. If you buy any goods at a reduced
price, verify your reduced price to another player, who may not
disclose this information. Put the cards you don’t buy in the
discard pile faceup.
If you discard old cargo to make room for newly bought cargo,
also discard them faceup. When the cargo deck runs out, shuffle it
thoroughly and place it facedown.
```
```
If you buy goods in the same port 2 turns in a row, you only draw
3 cargo cards.
```
```
You may hold a maximum of 6 cargo cards in port.
```
#### Visit shipyard

```
At the shipyard you can buy repairs, special weapons and ship
modifications. You can also buy a new ship and sell your old one.
```
```
Buy/sell ships: You must sell your old ship when buying a new one.
Modify the sales price by +1 gold per ship modification, and -
gold per point of damage (disregarding damage to crew). If you sell
a ship with ship modifications, these now re-enter the game.
```
```
When you buy a new ship you bring the crew from your old ship.
The man-o-war cannot be bought or sold.
```
```
Buy special weapons: Special weapons can be bought in any port
for 3 gold per token. You can only have 1 token of each special
weapon, but all 3 if you wish.
```
```
Repair: You can repair damage to your ship for a price of 2 gold per
point of damage. This includes damage to all locations except for
crew which must be recruited.
```
```
Buy ship modification: The only ship modification that can
be bought in a given port is the one represented by its ship
modification token. Facedown tokens are revealed in a port right
after the port action is taken.
```
```
When you buy a ship modification take the token and place it on
your player board on the corresponding area. The port now no
longer sells any ship modifications.
```
```
You cannot buy more than one of each of the same type of ship
modification. You can only transfer ship modifications from ship to
ship in St. John. Most of the combat related ship modifications do
not have an effect during merchant raids, but only during player vs.
player or NPC battles.
```
```
When a player ship with ship modifications is sunk, sold or
discarded, the player owning the ship must immediately distribute
the ship modification tokens randomly, facedown, in any ports
they choose currently without ship modifications.
```
#### Recruit

```
On a successful LEADERSHIP roll you can fill up your crew. If
the roll fails, crew may be recruited for 2 gold each. Your crew can
never exceed the CREW value of your ship.
```
#### Acquire a rumor

```
Pay 2 gold and roll your INFLUENCE skill. If successful, draw 1
rumor card and place it facedown on your player board.
```
```
You may only have 1 rumor card at a time; if you get another,
choose which to keep and shuffle the other back into the deck.
```
```
When taking the action on a rumor, roll the skill required. If you
fail, the rumor was false: discard the card. If successful you obtain
what was promised and then discard the card unless stated
otherwise.
```
```
When a rumor is found to be true and its effect has been resolved,
you get 1 glory point and a glory card.
```
#### Claim a mission

```
At the top of every mission card is listed:
Earn: The amount of gold or other benefits you can earn.
```
```
Req: Requirements to claim the mission.
```
```
Location: The port where you can claim the mission. If you attempt
to take a mission but fail, then unless stated otherwise it stays in
play. A new attempt to take the mission (or another in the same
port) can be made next turn during a new port action.
```
```
When you have claimed a mission, put it faceup on your player
board, then draw a new mission from the mission deck and place
the new mission at the location listed. You can only have one at a
time, but can discard one upon claiming a new one.
```
```
Completing a mission earns you 1 glory point and a glory card.
```
#### Stash gold

```
In your home port you may stash all or part of the gold you have
on your ship by placing it in your chest. Every 10 gold you stash
secretly counts as 1 glory point.
```
```
Declare to the other players when you stash gold, but not how
much. The total amount of gold you have stashed through the
game is secret. The only time you must let the other players see
your stashed gold is when you declare you have 10 glory points.
When you are in your home port you may freely spend gold from
your stash or move it onto your ship.
```
#### MERCHANT RAIDS

#### Merchant tokens

```
Merchant tokens can be engaged and plundered. As merchants
are raided the tokens are placed facedown on the merchant track.
If the track contains 8 merchant tokens at the beginning of a
turn (prior to drawing an event card), then blindly distribute them
facedown so that each sea zone again has one.
```
```
If you successfully scout for a merchant, remove the merchant
token from the sea zone and reveal the nation on its flip side. You
then decide whether the nationality of the merchant is that on
the token, or of the sea zone you are in. You may then choose to
engage the merchant, or let it sail away (the token is still placed on
the merchant track).
```
#### Merchant raids

```
You can only perform a merchant raid if none of your ship’s hit
locations are destroyed (reduced to 0). Perform these steps:
```
1. Draw 3 cargo cards and place them faceup in front of you.
2. Roll your captain’s SEAMANSHIP.
3. One at a time, you may use each success to draw an
additional card or discard a card or exchange a card.

```
After rolling your SEAMANSHIP skill you may spend one or more
of any type of special weapons token to convert a failed die into
a success.
```
```
You may draw an additional card, and then use another success
to discard or exchange the newly drawn card. Both discarded and
exchanged cards go in the cargo card discard pile; ignore them.
```
```
Determine if the raid was successful by referring to the icons in the
lower right corner of the remaining cards:
Hit: Each icon inflicts a point of damage to your ship,
to the location listed. If your hull is destroyed your ship
sinks and your captain dies. If any other location is
destroyed the raid fails, and further hits to a destroyed
location are transferred to your ship’s hull.
```
```
Escape: If the final number of escape icons equals or
exceeds your ship’s MANEUVERABILITY, the merchant
escaped (hits from hit icons are still applied).
```
```
If the merchant did not escape or destroy one of your hit
locations, your raid was successful. On each of the remaining
cards the number between 1 and 5 is the PLUNDER value and
equals the amount of gold you raid. You may also keep any of the
remaining cargo cards you have room for.
```
```
Successfully plundering a merchant for 12+ gold earns you 1 glory
point and a glory card.
```
#### BOUNTIES AND REWARDS

```
Put a bounty token on the bounty track on your player board
immediately after:
```
```
a. Starting combat with a non-pirate ship (includes merchant raids)
```
```
b. Defeating a naval ship (sinking it or winning crew combat)
```
```
The bounty token should always match the nation violated. Place a
nation’s bounty token on the number on the track corresponding to
the total number of bounties you have from that nation.
```
```
The maximum amount of bounties you can have from any single
nation is 5 (the maximum number on the track).
```
```
Bounties are usually permanent, but some cards allow you to
be pardoned. When you reduce a nation’s bounty to 0 you may
remove that nation’s bounty token from your player board and play
as if you never had a bounty from that nation.
```
#### Effects of bounties

```
You cannot usually enter ports belonging to the nations you are
wanted by. However, you can always enter your home port, and
Port Royal allows you to enter for a small fee or INFLUENCE roll.
Wanted by the authorities: Naval ships will attack you.
```
```
Pirate truce: NPC pirate ships will no longer attack you.
```
```
Worth a lot of gold: The amount of bounties you have from one
nation indicates how much gold that nation is willing to pay for
your head (5 gold per bounty). The more bounties you have the
more attractive it is for the other players to hunt you down.
```
#### Rewards

```
After defeating a pirate player you can immediately claim 5 gold
per bounty from one of those nations (you cannot get a reward
from a nation that has a bounty on your head, or which your nation
is at war with).
```
```
Defeating an NPC pirate sloop earns you 5 gold and defeating an
NPC pirate frigate earns you 15 gold. Only non-pirates can claim
such a reward.
```

#### GLORY CARDS

The object of the game is to gain 10 glory points.

Take a glory card whenever you get a glory point, for:

```
Defeating a player or NPC
(surviving and winning naval or crew combat)
Selling 3+ cargo cards at a port where the goods
sold are ‘in demand’.
Plundering 12+ gold in a merchant raid
Completing a mission
Finding a rumor to be true
Buying a galleon or frigate (only once per captain)
```
You may have only 4 glory cards. You may still draw a fifth card
and decide which card to discard (but cannot play a card until
you’ve decided which 4 cards to keep).

Unless stated otherwise on the card, you can play glory cards
freely during your turn, except during combat (when only cards
meant for combat can be played).

To play a card that can be played during another player’s turn,
announce it when the card says it must be played (without
revealing it). Other players may then announce if they also wish to
play cards. Players place their announced cards in front of them
and they are resolved in turn order, starting with the current player.
You may decline to play your announced card once it’s your turn,
but you must reveal the card you intended to play.

#### Specialists

```
There are 8 types of specialists: Carpenters,
Gunner Captains, Master Gunners, Surgeons, Lookouts,
Masters-at-Arms, Pursers, and Sailing Masters.
```
On each specialist glory card is listed what you need to do or pay
in order to hire them. Once hired, place the card faceup on your
player board. You may employ any number of specialists, but only
one of the same type.

#### NON-PLAYER CAPTAINS (NPCS)

NPCs are captains and ships not belonging to any player. They can
be either naval ships or pirate ships and are present on the board
as plastic miniatures.

NPCs are brought into play by event cards; place a drawn card
faceup on a designated board area and place an NPC ship in the
designated sea zone at the end of the turn.

Place a naval token below each brown naval ship to tell them
apart. There can only be one naval ship from each nation in play at
a time, and at most 2 pirates (the sloop and the frigate).

If you draw an event card of a ship already in play, at the end of the
turn place that card on top of the old one and move the miniature
to the sea zone of the new card. If the new captain dies, they are
replaced by the card below it and the miniature is moved back
to that captain’s home port (at the end of the turn). If there are 2
cards below it, randomly draw one of them to determine who the
replacement will be.

#### Hunt priority

NPCs will scout for, and move towards, player captains living up to
a set of criteria called hunt priority.

NPCs are hostile towards any player captain living up to one or
more of its hunt priorities.

Naval ships hunt for:

```
Player captains with a bounty from the naval ship’s nation.
Player captains with bounties from other nations.
If at war: Player captains of enemy nationality.
```
Pirate ships hunt for:

```
Non-pirate captains with gold on board.
Non-pirate captains with cargo on board.
Non-pirate captains with no cargo or gold.
```
#### Scouting

```
Hostile NPCs will scout for a target player immediately if one of the
following occurs:
The player moves into the sea zone of a hostile NPC
(including moving from port out to sea).
The player starts their turn at sea in the same sea zone
as a hostile NPC.
```
```
If the NPC succeeds its SCOUTING roll a battle ensues. If the NPC
survives, all its damage is repaired upon its next battle.
```
```
The SCOUTING skill of naval captains has an icon next to it which
indicates that the captain’s SCOUTING skill is either the value
listed or a value equal to how many matching bounty tokens the
target has – whichever is the highest.
```
```
All NPCs can share sea zones. However, NPC pirates in the same
sea zone as any naval ships will not scout for players; 2 man-o-
wars in the same sea zone do not scout for players; and if multiple
hostile NPCs in the same sea zone find the same player, determine
the order in which battles take place by shuffling the NPC event
cards in question and drawing them in random order.
```
#### NPC movement

```
Some event cards have 3 NPC icons which activate specific NPCs
and move them in the order they are listed on the card (if they are
present on the board). Each NPC will move in the direction listed
on its icon: North, South, East, West.
```
```
Sea zone borders have directional letters printed on them. If an
NPC cannot move in the direction printed on the card, it will move
clockwise to the next available sea zone.
```
```
An NPC will ignore a directional letter if it is in the same or
adjacent sea zone as a player living up to one or more of its hunt
priorities. Instead it will move (or stay) so that it ends up in the sea
zone of the targeted player.
```
```
If several players within reach fulfill a NPC’s hunt priorities, it will
move to the sea zone with the player captain living up the most to
its 1st priority. If tied, move to the 2nd priority, and then the 3rd. If
two players tie on all criteria, determine randomly who is targeted
by draw of captain cards.
```
#### NPC ships in combat

```
NPCs in combat are controlled by another player with an interest
in doing their best to secure victory. If there is a choice, the player
to the left of the player fighting the NPC controls it.
```
```
The player can freely control the NPC, with only one exception:
The Flee action may not be chosen unless the NPC has less
cannons or crew than the player captain it is up against.
```
```
In The Enemy! area on the board, place a brown cube on the track
of each hit location so that it corresponds to the NPC ship. NPC
ships not sunk or defeated are replenished once combat has
ended.
```
#### COMBAT

## NAVAL COMBAT

#### 1. Declaration

```
Combat is over several rounds until a captain loses or escapes.
Each round declare the combat action you wish to perform (the
aggressor – the captain that engaged the battle – starts).
```
```
On the first round, shoot is the only available action.
On subsequent rounds choose one of the following actions:
```
```
Shoot: Try to hit the enemy ship with cannon-fire.
Board: Try to board the enemy ship.
Flee: Try to escape from the battle.
```
#### 2. Seamanship contest

```
Each player rolls their captain’s SEAMANSHIP skill.
```
```
Resolve ties by adding up the numbers on the dice that did not
come up as successes. If still tied, proceed to the next round (after
inflicting cannon hits, if any).
```
```
Add 1 die to a captain’s SEAMANSHIP skill if their ship has a
MANEUVERABILITY 2 or more higher than the enemy ship.
```
#### 3. Action

```
The captain who rolls the most successes out-maneuvers their
opponent and may perform their selected action. If no captains get
any successes, no one wins—proceed to the next round.
Win, tie or lose refers to the SEAMANSHIP contest roll:
```
```
Shoot win: Inflict a hit with all your cannons.
Tie or loss: Inflict a hit with each die that came up a success (up
to the number of cannons on your ship).
Board win: You board the enemy ship: naval combat ends.
Cannon hits, if any, are applied before you board. Proceed to
crew combat unless your ship is sunk (you die), or you lose your
last crew (in which case the naval battle continues).
Flee win: If your opponent made no successes, then you escape
the battle and combat ends.
```
#### Hit Locations and damage

```
Roll a die for each cannon that hits its target. All locations except
hull have a number: when that number is rolled, the location is hit.
```
```
For every rolled, the target decides which of the 5 locations is
hit (unless the attacker is using any special weapons). Inflict the
‘number’ hits first and then the hits.
```
```
A hit location cube is moved down one step for each hit received.
```
```
When a cube is moved below 1, the cube is removed and the
location is destroyed. Further hits to destroyed locations go
directly to the ship’s hull.
```
```
Hull: If destroyed, your ship sinks. You lose the battle and your
captain dies.
Cargo: Each point of damage means your ship can carry 1
less cargo card. Cargo cards in excess of your cargo capacity
are randomly removed.
Masts: If destroyed, you only roll one die during SEAMANSHIP
contests and can only select the shoot action.
Crew: If destroyed, you can’t select the board action and
automatically lose crew combat once it begins.
Cannons: You inflict 1 less hit for each point of damage.
If destroyed, you can’t inflict any cannon hits.
```
```
If you survive combat with destroyed hit locations, you may still
move around on the board. However, if you are engaged again
you are still subject to the effects of any destroyed hit locations.
Additionally, you cannot make any merchant raids with destroyed
locations.
Hits inflicted by 2 players the same round are inflicted
simultaneously. A player therefore may inflict hits even if sunk,
or if they lose any cannons.
```
## CREW COMBAT

```
Crew combat takes place immediately after one player boards
another (or due to some rumors or missions).
```
```
Every round both captains roll their LEADERSHIP skill
simultaneously. Each success inflicts a hit to the enemy crew. The
maximum amount of hits you can inflict in a round is equal to how
many crew you have (prior to rolling).
```
```
Captains who lose all their crew lose the battle, die, and the winner
may plunder the ship.
```
```
If both captains lose their last crew the same round, the battle is
won by the captain who made the most successes. Resolve ties by
adding up numbers on the dice that did not come up as successes.
If still tied, combat ends with no winner.
```
## GLORY CARDS IN COMBAT

```
Player captains in battles may play glory cards with combat effects
stated on the card. If the opponent is another player, they too may
then declare they wish to play a card with a similar timing. Cards
are then resolved (aggressor’s card first). Then, if no new cards with
similar timing are declared, the battle continues.
```
## SPECIAL WEAPONS

```
You may have only one of each special weapon token.
```
#### Grappling hooks

```
After a SEAMANSHIP contest where you choose to board,
you may discard to re-roll any number of your dice.
```
#### Chain-shots and grapeshots

```
Discard either one of these tokens after rolling hit locations:
```
```
Chain-shot: Each inflicts a hit to your enemy’s MASTS.
Hits to a destroyed masts location are never transferred
to HULL in a round where you used chain-shots.
Grapeshot: Each inflicts a hit to your enemy’s CREW.
Hits to a destroyed crew location are never transferred to
HULL in a round where you used grapeshots.
```
#### PLUNDER

#### Plundering player captains

```
If you defeat a player in crew combat (regardless of who initiated
the boarding), you may take the player’s gold on board, glory
cards, cargo cards, rumor card, special weapons, ship, and
specialists. Any employed specialists can be transferred to your
ship at no cost. Discard any specialists you can’t (or don’t want
to) employ. If the player was a pirate, you get a reward based on
how many bounties the defeated player had. Any mission card the
player has is discarded.
```
#### Plundering naval ships

```
When you win crew combat against a naval ship (no matter who
initiated the boarding) draw 3 cargo cards and get an amount of
gold equal to the Plunder value on the drawn cards. Randomly
discard a cargo card for each hit the naval ship took to its cargo.
The remaining goods are yours to keep, and you may also keep the
ship if you wish.
```
#### Plundering NPC pirates

```
The pirate frigate and sloop have no cargo or gold onboard.
However, if you are a non-pirate and you defeat a pirate ship (sink
it or win crew combat), you get a reward: 5 gold for defeating a
sloop and 15 gold for defeating a frigate.
```
#### Claiming ships

```
When you win a boarding battle over an NPC or player, you may
discard your current ship and claim the one you fought. You
may transfer crew, cargo, special weapons, gold and all your
cards freely to the new ship, but ship modifications cannot be
transferred.
```
#### DYING AND RETIREMENT

```
If your captain dies, discard your captain, your cards, your ship,
your possessions on the ship (special weapons, cargo, gold), and
your bounty tokens. Draw a new captain and continue on your next
turn. Keep the number of glory points you have and any gold you
have stashed (now located in the home port of your new captain).
```
```
Follow the setup instructions; however if there is a pirate NPC
located in the sea zone of the captain you drew, you may draw
another. You only receive 10 gold from the game if you have no
gold stashed, otherwise if you have less than 10 the game supplies
you with the remaining gold up to 10.
```
```
You may retire your captain before performing any actions if you
start your turn in a port. On your next turn, go through the same
steps as when dying and start with a new captain.
```
#### WINNING

```
The first player to gain 10 glory points declares this, and the game
ends after everyone has had their turn. If several players reach 10
in the same turn, the player with the most points wins; on a tie, the
one with the largest stash wins.
```

#### 2. Seamanship contest

```
Roll SEAMANSHIP skill. Add 1 die to a captain if their
ship has a MANEUVERABILITY 2 or more higher than their
opponent’s.
```
#### 3. Action

```
The captain who rolls the most successes may perform their
selected action. If no captains get any successes, no one wins –
proceed to the next round.
```
```
Win, tie or lose refers to the SEAMANSHIP contest roll:
```
```
Shoot win: Inflict a hit with all your cannons.
Tie or loss: Inflict a hit with each die that came up a
success (up to the number of cannons on your ship).
Board win: Naval combat ends. Any cannon hits are
applied before you board. Proceed to crew combat.
Flee win: If your opponent made no successes, you
escape the battle and combat ends.
```
#### Hit locations and damage

```
Roll a die for each cannon that hits to determine the location.
For every rolled, the target decides which of the locations is
hit (unless special weapons were used). Inflict the ‘number’ hits
first and then the hits.
```
```
Further hits to destroyed locations go directly to the hull.
Hull: If destroyed, your ship sinks. You lose; captain dies.
Cargo: Each point of damage means your ship can carry 1
less cargo card. Cargo cards in excess of your cargo capacity
are randomly removed.

contests and can only select the shoot action.
Crew: If destroyed, you can’t select the board action and

```
## CREW COMBAT

Captains who lose all their crew lose the battle, die, and the
winner may plunder the ship.

After a SEAMANSHIP contest where you choose to
board, discard to re-roll any number of your dice.

Hits to a destroyed crew location are never transferred
to HULL in a round where you used this.

#### SEAS OF GLORY EXPANSION

#### MODULE 1: RUMORS, MISSIONS,

#### EVENTS & CAPTAINS

Use the new rumor, mission and captain cards either separately as
new decks, or shuffled in with the base game cards.

New event cards must be used together with the base game event
cards. Naval man-o-wars may appear even without an active war
(use a brown galleon from the base game) as well as NPC pirate
brigs and man-o-wars (use the new black miniatures). As normal,
any 2 man-o-wars in the same sea zone do not scout for players.

###### Mission tokens

To make more space on the board, place active missions next to
the board with mission tokens on them, and put the matching
mission tokens in the sea zones where the missions can be
claimed.

The third pair of tokens is used for the Employers Calling event
card, which adds a third mission to the game.

###### Home-port tokens

A flag token in each player’s color can be placed on each player’s
home port for easier identification.

###### NPC spawn tokens

These remind players where new NPCs will appear at the end of
the turn when an NPC event card is drawn. The brown flag is used
for naval ships and the black flag is used for NPC pirates.

#### MODULE 2: NEW SPECIAL WEAPONS

Add the new special weapons. A ship can now hold up to 6 special
weapons (one of each type).

All special weapons can still be spent in merchant raids to convert
a failed die, but each have a unique effect if used in naval combat.

###### Heated shot

```
Spend (discard token) after rolling hit locations and
rolling at least one. rolled do no damage, but the
enemy ship catches fire: place the heated shot token on
the enemy ship card. Prior to every new naval combat
round, the targeted ship receives 1 point of damage to a
location of the target captain’s choice.
```
Once crew combat begins or the battle ends, remove the
heated shot token; there is no further damage.

###### Double shot

```
Spend (discard token) after rolling hit locations to make
up to 2 hits do 1 extra hit each. Apply non- hits first.
Then, evenly apply all hits to as many different non-
empty hit locations as possible (target captain’s choice).
```
May not be combined with other special weapons.

###### Caltrops

```
Spend (discard token) after a SEAMANSHIP contest where
you chose to board (regardless of who won the roll).
```
On the following combat round, the enemy captain has
a -1 penalty (min 1) on their next SEAMANSHIP or
LEADERSHIP roll (SEAMANSHIP if you lost and didn’t
manage to board, LEADERSHIP if you did).

You may use both grappling hooks and caltrops in the same
combat round.

However, only 1 special ammunition (chain-shot, grapeshot,
heated shot, or double shot) can be spent per combat round.

#### MODULE 3: NEW SHIP

#### MODIFICATIONS

###### Setup

```
Add the new ship modifications you use to the base game ship
modification tokens before distributing them. After distributing
them, place the remaining tokens facedown (or in a cup) without
looking at them, to form a reserve pool.
```
###### Carved hull: Your opponent has -1 SEAMANSHIP

```
(min 1) when either of you selects Flee during naval
combat.
```
###### Crow’s nest: You may add 1 die to a SCOUTING roll (prior

```
to rolling) or subtract 1 die from an enemy’s SCOUTING
roll (min 1, prior to scouting for you). This mod only works
if you have fully repaired masts.
```
###### Smuggler’s hold: Only use with the Contraband module.

```
One contraband does not take up a cargo space, is
‘invisible” to NPCs, and is immune to cards and damage
effects. Whenever relevant, pick which contraband card
you want to be immune.
```
###### The plank: Only use with the Loyalty module. Avoid a

```
loss on the loyalty track when an NPC event card is
drawn by choosing to either: roll LEADERSHIP and
succeed; or (if at sea) discarding a crew.
```
###### Re-entering the game

```
When a player ship with ship modifications is sunk, sold or
discarded, place any ship modifications back with the unused ship
mods in the reserve pool. Then randomly draw a number of ship
modifications matching the amount you just discarded and have
them re-enter the game as normal: the player owning the ship
places them randomly and facedown in any port of their choosing
that is currently without ship modification tokens (or back in the
pool once all ports have a ship modification).
```
###### Ship modification market (optional)

```
If a port has no ship modification when taking a port action, you may
draw 1 random ship modification from the reserve pool and either
buy it, or place it faceup for sale in the port you are currently in.
```
#### MODULE 4: NPC UPGRADES

###### Setup

```
The 17 NPC upgrade tokens are both NPC ship modifications and
NPC special weapons. Place them facedown next to the board (or
in a cup near the NPCs) to form a reserve pool.
```
```
If you aren’t using the new ship modifications or special weapons
modules, remove the matching NPC upgrade tokens from the
pool.
```
###### Drawing upgrades

```
Every time you draw an NPC event card, draw a random NPC
upgrade token and place it on the card. The NPC ship gains the
abilities matching the NPC upgrade token on its card.
```
```
If you draw the 0 token, the NPC has no upgrade; return the
0 token to the pool. If you draw the 2 token, the NPC has 2
upgrades; draw 2 new tokens and place the 2 token back into the
pool (redraw the 0 token when drawing 2 upgrades).
```
```
When a new NPC of the same nation/type is drawn (covering an
existing NPC card), return the token on the old card and draw a
new token for the new card. Similarly, when an NPC with other
NPC cards beneath it is defeated, draw a new token for the new
active NPC (regardless of its previous token). Only the top NPC
card of each type should have an NPC upgrade token, and you
draw a token every time an NPC is drawn or revealed.
```
###### Circumstantial rules

- During War & Peace events, NPC frigates that ‘become’ man-o-
    wars, or vice versa, keep their current token(s).
- Draw a new token if a man-o-war ends up with an upgrade it
    can’t have (eg. hammocks or extra cannon).
       - After a battle, an NPC gets its special weapon upgrade back
          after it is used, if it survived.
       - If an NPC has the crow’s nest, it will always use it when
          scouting and the player who will control it during a battle may
          decide if the crow’s nest is used to avoid being found.

###### Defeating an NPC with upgrades

```
If an NPC with upgrades is sunk, return the NPC upgrade tokens
back to the pool.
If you defeat an NPC in crew combat, you may keep any unspent
NPC special weapon upgrades if you have room for them. Place
them on your board as normal and put them back with the other
NPC upgrade tokens when used, sold, or if your ship is sunk.
```
```
If you claim the ship, it keeps its upgrades. Place the NPC upgrade
tokens on your player board in the appropriate areas. These
upgrades are placed back with the other NPC upgrade tokens if
your ship is sunk or sold.
```
#### MODULE 5: SHIPS

###### The brig

```
The brig costs 20 gold (sells for 5), but does not award a glory
point when purchased. Its large cargo and added defense
capabilities make it a good all-purpose ship, viable for both pirates
and merchants.
```
```
If you play with the brig, also use the new galleon cards to make
the choice of a new ship a more interesting one.
```
###### Low maneuverability galleons

```
Galleon ship cards with a MANEUVERABILITY of 1 are less efficient
in battle and very poor for merchant raids/pirating.
```
```
Use the modified galleons when playing with the brig; when
playing with the Flexible Turns or Cutthroat variant (due to
increased chance of PvP combat); and if you feel that the galleon
is overpowered compared to the frigate.
```
#### MODULE 6: TREASURE GALLEON

###### Setup

```
Place the treasure galleon miniature (the gold galleon) in the
Cartagena sea zone.
```
```
Place the treasure galleon board faceup to display the stats of its
captain and the gold it is transporting.
```
###### Movement and gold

```
The treasure galleon moves like other NPCs, in the direction of the
first move icon (upper left) of any event card featuring move icons
(no matter which specific nation or pirate icon it is).It has no hunt
criteria and never initiates a battle.
```
```
When the treasure galleon moves, also place 5 gold on the
treasure galleon board. The total on the board is the amount of
gold that an attacker can plunder from the ship.
```
###### Attacking the treasure galleon

```
Player captains can scout for and attack the treasure fleet when
in the same sea zone. If successful, a naval battle begins and you
receive 1 Spanish bounty.
```
```
If you defeat the galleon you get 1 glory point, 1 additional Spanish
bounty for every 10 gold on the treasure galleon board (rounded
down), and. if you won through crew combat, you may claim the
galleon as your ship and/or all the gold on its board. There is no
cargo to plunder.
```
```
Like all other NPCs, the treasure galleon is fully repaired between
battles. If defeated, it is out for the rest of the game.
```
###### Treasure galleon with other modules/variants

```
The treasure galleon is subject to any other modules or variants
added, eg. if you play with NPC upgrades, you also draw
one for the treasure galleon; or if you play with the lowered
MANEUVERABILITY for galleons, this also affects the treasure
galleon.
```
#### MODULE 7: CONTRABAND

```
Use the replacement A Myriad of Goods rumor card when using
this module.
```
###### Setup

```
Shuffle the contraband cards into the cargo deck. They can work
like normal cargo cards or act as contraband – a new type of cargo
consisting of illegal or embargoed goods.
```
###### Getting contraband

```
When buying cargo, do the following in order:
```
1. Redraws: Redraw any cards that show the good in demand as
    usual, but also cards showing contraband that is supposed to
    be sold in the port you currently are in.
2. Buy contraband: If any of the cards are contraband cards, you
    may choose to buy them as such for 3 gold each (regardless of
    how many you draw). If bought, place them on the contraband
    space on the main expansion player board.
3. Buy regular cargo: Any cards not bought as contraband work
    just like normal cargo cards (including reducing the price of
    cards featuring the same good). Place on the regular cargo
    space if bought.

```
When getting cargo cards from merchant raids, rumor /mission
rewards, etc., you may place any cards showing the contraband
option on either your regular cargo space or your contraband
space. As when buying, where the cargo card is placed defines
what it is.
```
###### Selling contraband

```
Contraband can only be sold in the port listed on the card. To sell
the card, present it during the sell goods port activity and take
10 gold.
```
```
You get 1 glory point for every 2 contraband you sell. Keep track
by placing the first sold contraband card behind your captain card
and placing it in the discard pile when the second is sold (along
with the second card). If your captain dies, a contraband card
behind your captain card is kept for your new captain.
```
```
Single contraband cards do not count as ½ points for purposes
of scoring.
```
###### Traveling with contraband

```
Naval ships will scout for any non-pirate player with contraband
(but do not hunt/move towards them). If found, the non-pirate
captain may either:
```
- Resist and attack the NPC (getting a bounty as if starting
    the battle).
- Discard all contraband cards to avoid the battle.

```
No changes are made to naval ship scouting in regards to pirate
players with contraband (naval ships continue to scout and attack
as normal).
```
###### Important terms

```
Whenever the rules or cards refer to cargo, cargo cards or goods,
they refer to all kinds of cargo cards, both specific goods and
contraband.
```
```
However, if you are asked to buy or draw a card with a specific
good, you must ignore any contraband option and place it with
regular cargo.
```
```
Likewise, if you must discard or sell a specific good it would also
have to come from your regular cargo space.
```
```
If a rule refers to contraband, then specific goods do not apply and
the good shown on the xontraband card is irrelevant. Only cargo
cards placed on the contraband space of the player mat qualify.
```
###### Taking damage to cargo

```
When you are forced to discard cards, for each card you may
choose to discard one from the regular cargo space or the
contraband space (the card is still selected randomly from all
cards on the chosen space, if necessary). If there are no cards
remaining in one space, you must choose the other.
```

#### MODULE 8: WIND AND WEATHER

This module has 2 parts. You can play with wind direction without
the storm if preferred.

#### 1. Wind direction

Spin the weather spinner at the beginning of the turn prior to the
event card draw. The direction it ends on is the wind direction.

You may take a free move action in the wind direction once per
turn, but it takes 2 actions the first time you move against the wind
in a turn (the second time takes only 1 action as normal).

#### 2. The storm token

Place the storm token on the transparent pin and put it in The
Caribbean sea zone at the beginning of the game.

The storm token moves in the direction determined by the wind
spinner immediately after it is spun. If the direction is unavailable,
move it to the next possible sea zone in a clockwise direction (like
NPCs).

Captains receive 3 random hits minus 1 for every SEAMANSHIP
success when:

- Moving into a sea zone with the storm token (including leaving
    port in the same sea zone).
- Starting their turn at sea in the sea zone with the storm token.

There are no changes to the Storm event cards. Captains may
need to deal with both the storm token and an event card storm.

Captain Christian Marquis also ignores the storm token.

NPCs in a sea zone with the storm token never scout for players,
but NPCs are not affected by storm damage or wind direction.

#### MODULE 9: LOCATION TOKENS

#### Setup

Place the location tokens randomly faceup in all sea zones except
the Caribbean Sea. If the 2 Trade Stations end up in adjacent
sea zones, shuffle a few locations around until they are no longer
adjacent.

#### Visit a location

When at sea, a captain may spend an action to visit the location
in their sea zone (only once per turn, per location) to perform the
activities offered by the location. A captain does not have to move
to the location first. Some locations restrict who can visit them.

Locations are not regarded as ports. They are never affected by
the abilities written in each sea zone.

Captains can still be scouted for and attacked even if they have
just visited a location (they remain in the sea zone).

#### Location raid

When at sea, captains may also spend an action to raid a location
in the same sea zone (no SCOUTING roll required), even if they
have visited it that turn.

Like merchant raids, it is only possible to attempt a location raid if
the player’s ship has no destroyed hit locations.

1. Draw the number of cargo cards indicated on the location and
    line them up in front of you. Hit icons represent the location’s
    cannon fire on you and escape icons represent soldiers/pirates/
    militia/ visitors ready to fight you on land, as well as general
    preparedness.
2. Bombardment: You may roll 1 die for each of your cannons.
    You roll 1 die at a time and discard a card of your choice for
    each success you make. You can stop the bombardment prior
    to any roll. Special weapons do not affect bombardment.
3. Receive hits: Each remaining hit icon either inflicts 1 hit to your
    ship at the indicated hit location, or 2 hits to that hit location
    if the number of escape icons matches or beats your ship’s
    MANEUVERABILITY.

If your hull is destroyed, you sink and die. Any other destroyed
hit location means the raid fails. If none of your ship’s hit

```
locations are destroyed, you may continue the ground assault.
You may also retreat and end the attack at this point.
```
4. Ground assault: Roll LEADERSHIP. Receive 1 hit to crew for
    each remaining escape icon minus 1 for every LEADERSHIP
    success you made.

```
If your crew is reduced to 0, you are killed. This is considered
a single round of crew combat in regards to glory cards and
captain / specialist abilities.
```
```
If you survive, you get gold matching the plunder value of the cards
and may take as many of the remaining cargo cards as you have
room for. Then remove the location token from the board for the
rest of the game.
```
```
Remember to gain any bounties when attacking or succeeding the
raid as noted on the location token.
```
```
If you plunder 12+ gold, you are awarded 1 glory point.
```
```
Location raids are not considered merchant raids for purposes of
glory cards and special abilities. However, cards and abilities that
specifically say battle are allowed. Cards and abilities which say
crew combat may also be used after the ground assault begins.
```
#### MODULE 10: FAVORS

#### Setup

```
Each player places a favor board next to their player board and
places a cube in their color on the No Favors space.
```
#### Gaining favors

```
You can get favors in 3 ways:
```
1. As a port activity performed at the end of a port action, buy
    favors for 2 gold each (up to 5 max).
2. After taking a mission get 1 favor.
3. After completing a mission get 1 favor.
As you get favors, move the cube up to mark your current total.
You may never have more than 5 favors.

#### Spending favors

```
Spend a favor by moving the cube down the scale to:
```
1. Redraw all cards of any one type drawn simultaneously
    (except for events). You may not use a favor when drawing
    event cards or if an event has you draw cards.
2. Re-roll one of your non-combat skill rolls. You can use this on
    scouting (for players, merchants or NPCs in an attempt to start
    a battle, or rolling to see if a rumor is true), but not on any naval
    combat or raid rolls.
3. Make an NPC re-roll a SCOUTING roll made to find you.
4. Enter a port illegally (ignoring bounties and/or war effects).
    Pay 1 favor per bounty you have from that port’s nation (if any)
    plus 1 additional favor if you are entering an enemy nation’s
    port during war (as usual, after entering you are free to take a
    port action).

```
You can only spend 1 favor per situation. However, a merchant
raid could consist of several different draws and a favor could be
used on each.
Wars or bounties do not hinder your ability to use or get favors.
```
```
You can only spend favors on yourself.
```
```
If your captain dies, all favors are lost (however you may keep
them if you play the Survivor glory card).
```
```
Alexandre Villon only needs to roll Influence to take a port action if
he used his captain’s ability to enter an illegal port. If his Influence
roll fails (he may use a favor to re-roll), he may still take a port
action if he can pay the favors that would have allowed him to
enter.
```
#### MODULE 11: LOYALTY TRACK

#### Setup

```
Each player places a loyalty board on the left side of their player
board and places a cube in their color on the Content space.
```
#### Gameplay

```
Throughout the game your crew’s loyalty to you as their captain
will increase and decrease. The different steps on the loyalty track
grant bonuses or inflict harsh penalties.
```
```
The benefits or penalties are cumulative: eg. a captain with a
Happy crew also enjoys the benefits described on the Pleased
step, and a captain with an Angry crew would also suffer the
penalties of Restless and Unhappy.
```
#### Losing loyalty

```
Captains go down 1 step on the loyalty track:
```
1. Any time an event card with an NPC captain is drawn (a trigger
    representing time, fear and other opportunities).
2. When declaring an intent to stash.
3. When starting and ending a turn in the same port.

#### Gaining loyalty

```
Loyalty is increased by 1 step:
```
1. When getting a glory point.
2. When, as a port activity, you pay an amount of gold shown on
    the next highest step of the loyalty track. Only 1 step per port
    action.

```
Fierce loyalty: On their turn, a player may roll LEADERSHIP.
If successful, move one step down the loyalty track and take
an extra action (one attempt per turn).
Happy: The captain has +1 LEADERSHIP for combat purposes
(crew combat and location raids).
Pleased: The captain may recruit in any port and for free
(overruling sea zones such as Petite Goave). This also includes
specialists on glory cards which no longer cost gold to employ
and aren’t tied to any specific port. You can only gain one free
specialist per turn using this loyalty ability.
```
```
Content: No effect.
```
```
Restless: The captain cannot recruit for free and cannot employ
new specialists (on glory cards, rumors or otherwise). The penalty
of not being able to recruit for free overrules any other mechanic
allowing free recruiting. Additionally, the powers of employed
specialists don’t have any effect.
```
```
Unhappy: Whenever the captain wants to play a glory card, they
must roll LEADERSHIP. If failed, they cannot play the card this
turn.
```
```
Angry: The captain has -1 LEADERSHIP (minimum 1) for
combat purposes (crew combat and location raids).
```
```
Mutiny: If this step is reached, a LEADERSHIP roll must
immediately be made. If successful, you move up to Angry, and
if you fail, the captain is killed and the regular rules for captains
dying are applied. This roll is not considered crew combat.
```
#### VARIANTS

## VARIANT 1 : FLEXIBLE TURNS

```
Increases the chance of player vs. player combat, and reduces the
sense of downtime.
```
```
Place 1 cube in each player color into the black cloth bag. After
drawing an event card, any player draws a cube from the bag.
```
```
The color drawn is the color of the player who may now take their
actions. When done, a new cube is drawn and that player now
takes their action. Once all players have had their turn, the cubes
are placed back into the bag and a new round begins.
```
## VARIANT 2 : CAPTAINS,

## CAPTAINS, CAPTAINS!

```
Adds a larger choice of starting captain.
```
```
Yarr, get on with it! Each player gets to draw 2 captain cards and
picks the captain they want.
```
```
It’ll cost ya! Each player is handed 1 captain as per normal rules.
In turn order, each player may choose to pay 2 gold to draw a new
captain, and then 2 more gold to draw a 3rd captain if desired. The
player then chooses among these captains.
```
## VARIANT 3 : GIVE ME GLORY

## OR GIVE ME DEATH

```
Puts a larger emphasis on scoring glory points rather than
stashing gold.
```
```
The cost of glory points from your stash goes up for each point
by 5 gold. The first glory point costs you 10 gold as normal. The
second costs you 15 gold, the third 20 gold, etc.
```
```
This means it would require a total of 100 gold stashed in order to
score all the allowed 5 glory points from stash.
```
## VARIANT 4 : IT’S A HARD LIFE

```
Places NPCs in the water at the start of play to increase activity
on the board and the difficulty.
Just before the game is about to begin, go through the event deck.
Put into play the first 2 naval ships (from different nations) and the
first NPC pirate ship you draw (does not affect loyalty). Redraw
any NPC which shares a home-port with a player captain (continue
through the deck and draw a new one). Once ready, begin the
game as normal.
This means that an NPC pirate could move into a player’s sea zone
the very first turn.
```
## VARIANT 5 : CUTTHROAT

```
Adds more frequent player vs. player battles.
A player may scout for the active player immediately after the
active player moves into their sea zone (including moving from
port out to sea). Upon making an off-turn scouting attempt, the
player flips their captain card as a reminder, and then flips it back
upon their next turn. If the scouting roll is successful, the active
player is found and a battle occurs. If the active player survives the
encounter they may continue their turn.
```
```
Any player who makes an off-turn scouting attempt has 2 actions
less on their next turn.
```
```
A captain cannot make an off-turn scouting attempt if their card is
flipped (ie. they have already made an off-turn scouting attempt).
Off-turn scouting occurs prior to any NPCs present in the same
sea zone.
If the active player moves into a sea zone with multiple player
captains, each of them declares in turn order if they wish to make
an off-turn scouting attempt. Those who do, roll their SCOUTING
skill, but only the captain with the most successes finds the
active player.
```
```
Resolve ties by counting pips. On a further tie, the players re-roll.
All captains who attempt the off-turn scouting receive the 2 action
penalty.
```

is in the same sea zone.
```
```
You cannot:
```
- use a town to complete a rumor that requires you
    to be in a specific port.
- recruit a specialist supposed to be recruited in a
    specific port.
- claim a port’s mission.
- sell contraband.
- buy ship modifications.
- use a town as your home-port for stashing.
