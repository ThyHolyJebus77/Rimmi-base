## Condensed Rules Summary

1. Setup:
   - Choose a scenario from the mission book.
   - Set up the game board and place tokens as shown in the scenario.
   - Heroes: Choose your characters and take their boards, miniatures, and equipment.
   - Villain: Set up your command post with character tiles and miniatures.

2. Game Structure:
   - The game is played in rounds, alternating between hero and villain turns.
   - Each round starts with an upkeep phase (advance turn marker, resolve effects).

3. Hero Turn:
   - Heroes choose to be active or resting.
   - Active heroes can perform actions; resting heroes recover energy.
   - Actions include: Move, Attack (Melee or Ranged), Manipulate objects, or Use special abilities.
   - Each action costs energy cubes. Move cubes from your reserve to the action space.
   - Roll dice for actions: The number of dice equals energy cubes spent.

4. Villain Turn:
   - Activate up to 2 tiles from your river (command post).
   - For each tile, activate any number of its characters.
   - Each character can Move, then perform an Action, then Move again.
   - Actions and movement cost energy cubes, like heroes.

5. Combat:
   - Attacker rolls dice based on energy spent and weapon bonuses.
   - Defender rolls defense dice.
   - Compare successes: If attacker has more, defender takes wounds.

6. Winning the Game:
   - Complete the scenario-specific objectives before time runs out or the other side achieves their goal.

### Key Points to Remember:
- Manage your energy cubes carefully - they're used for all actions.
- Use your character's unique abilities and equipment.
- Work together as heroes or coordinate your minions as the villain.
- Pay attention to the scenario objectives - they're your path to victory!

# Batman: Gotham City Chronicles - Rules
## SETUP

Set up the board, tokens, scenery and miniatures as indicated by
the scenario. The villain takes their tiles and sets them up in their
command post. The hero players take hero boards and choose any
required equipment and/or bat-gadget cards. All players set up
their energy cubes allotment.

The distance between 2 areas is measured by counting the
minimum number of moves that separates them (not the move
cost). There can never be a negative value in the game. Any result
that would be negative is considered equal to 0.

## GAME ROUND SEQUENCE

## A. Upkeep

#### ADVANCE THE TURN MARKER The side with initiative moves the

turn marker forward 1 space on the turn track.

#### TRIGGER UPKEEP PHASE EFFECTS Resolve any effects specified

in the mission that trigger at this time. If several happen
simultaneously, the side with initiative chooses the order.

## B. Turn of the side with initiative

The mission indicates which side first has initiative (blue for
heroes, grey for the villain).

## C. Check end game conditions 1

The mission describes the end game conditions. If at least 1 of
these is fulfilled, the game immediately ends and the winner is
determined. If not, the turn continues.

## D. Turn of the side without initiative

## E. Check end game conditions 2

The mission describes the end game conditions. If at least 1 of
these is fulfilled, the game immediately ends and the winner is
determined. If not, the turn continues with a new turn.

## HERO TURN

#### 1. UPKEEP HERO START OF TURN

Move all energy cubes spent by heroes during the villain’s turn to
those heroes’ fatigue zones.

#### 2. TRIGGER START OF HERO TURN EFFECTS

Resolve any effects that trigger at the start of the hero turn.
If several happen simultaneously, the heroes choose the order.

#### 3. DECLARE HERO STANCE

Each hero must choose their stance: **active** or **resting**.
A neutralized hero _must_ choose the resting stance.

**Active stance:** Place your stance marker _active hero_ side faceup,
then move the number of energy cubes indicated from your fatigue
zone to your reserve zone. If there are not enough cubes in the
fatigue zone, move the rest from wound zone to fatigue zone.

**Resting stance:** Place your stance marker _resting hero_ side
faceup, then move the number of energy cubes indicated on the
marker as above. **A resting hero can only perform free actions,
rerolls and defenses.**

#### 4. CHOOSE ACTING HERO

The hero players decide who will be the first **acting hero** from
among those who wish to perform actions. This hero carries out the
Hero Actions step. If no heroes are active, or none wish to perform
an action, skip to the Trigger End of Hero Turn Effects step.

#### 5. HERO ACTIONS

```
The acting hero declares which of the 5 actions they wish to
perform and then carries out that action.
```
```
Then, if at least 1 active hero still wishes to perform action(s),
the heroes return to the previous step. If none of the active heroes
want to perform an action, continue to the next step.
```
#### 6. TRIGGER END OF HERO TURN EFFECTS

```
Resolve any effects that trigger at the end of the hero turn.
If several happen simultaneously, the heroes choose the order.
```
#### 7. UPKEEP HERO END OF TURN

```
Move all energy cubes spent by the heroes during their turn to
those heroes’ fatigue zones.
```
## HERO ACTIONS

## Melee attack

**1. Declare a melee attack:** The hero declaring the melee attack
is the **attacker**.
**2. Declare the target (defender):** If unable to declare a target, the
attack ends immediately. The defender must be in the same area
as the attacker, or in an adjacent area the attacker would over-
occupy and to which they have LOS.
**3. Spend energy cubes:** Move the number of energy cubes you
wish to spend (min 1) from your reserve zone to your melee attack
action space. You cannot spend energy cubes to the melee attack
action space if you would exceed its exertion limit (if the limit has
been reached, the action ends).
**4. Create the dice pool:** Take as many dice (your melee attack
characteristic specifies the color) as the amount of cubes spent.
**5. Add weapon bonuses** if using a melee attack weapon card.
**6. Roll your dice pool**.
**7. Rerolls:** You may attempt to improve the result by rerolling.
**8. Total successes:** Melee attacks are not affected by hindering.
**9. Defending and wounds:** The defender must defend themselves,
and then apply any wounds.

## Ranged attack

**1. Declare a ranged attack:** The hero declaring the ranged attack
is the **attacker**. You can only perform a ranged attack if you are
carrying a ranged weapon you can use.
**2. Declare the target (defender):** You must have LOS to the
defender. There is LOS between 2 areas if an imaginary straight
line can be drawn between their LOS markers without crossing
walls, promontories or an area with an elevation higher than the
2 areas. Between 2 areas of different elevation levels, the LOS
must also not cross an area with an elevation level equal to the
higher level of the 2 areas. Note that LOS can begin or end on a
promontory without being blocked.

```
There is also LOS if the areas are adjacent and separated by an
orange area boundary, or if they have at least 1 letter in common
around their LOS markers.
```
```
A miniature always has LOS to its own area, and LOS is not
blocked by miniatures.
```
**3. Spend energy cubes:** Move the number of energy cubes you
wish to spend (min 1) from your reserve zone to your ranged
attack action space. You cannot spend energy cubes to the ranged
attack action space if you would exceed its exertion limit (if the
limit has been reached, the action ends).
**4. Create the dice pool:** Take as many dice (your ranged attack
characteristic specifies the color) as the amount of cubes spent.
**5. Add weapon bonuses** from the ranged attack weapon card you
used. If you target a defender in an area at a lower elevation, add
an extra yellow die **elevation bonus** to your dice pool.
    **6. Roll your dice pool**.
    **7. Rerolls:** You may attempt to improve the result by rerolling.
    **8. Total successes:** Ranged attacks are affected by hindering, so
    subtract the hindering index from the number of successes.
    **9. Defending and wounds:** The defender must defend themselves,
    and then apply any wounds.

## Manipulation

#### COMPLEX MANIPULATION

**1. Declare a complex manipulation:** You may only throw a piece
of equipment, or perform complex manipulations specified by the
mission or in your skills description.
**2. Spend energy cubes:** Move the number of energy cubes
you wish to spend (min 1) from your reserve zone to your
manipulation action space. You cannot spend energy cubes to the
manipulation action space if you would exceed its exertion limit
(if the limit has been reached, the action ends).
**3. Create the dice pool:** Take as many dice (your manipulation
characteristic specifies the color) as the amount of cubes spent.
**4. Add tool card bonuses:** You constantly benefit from these bonuses.
**5. Roll your dice pool**.
**6. Rerolls:** You may attempt to improve the result by rerolling.
**7. Total successes:** Complex manipulations are affected by
hindering, so the hindering index must be subtracted from the
number of successes. Compare the result to the action’s difficulty
level. If the result is equal to or higher, you succeed and continue
to the next step. If the result is lower, you fail.
**8. Apply the complex manipulation**.

#### AUTOMATIC MANIPULATION

**1. Declare an automatic manipulation:** You may only give a piece
of equipment, take a piece of equipment, pick up a piece of
equipment, or perform automatic manipulations specified by the
mission or in your skills description.
**2. Spend 1 energy cube:** Move 1 energy cube from your reserve
zone to your manipulation action space. If the exertion limit has
already been reached, the action ends.
**3. Apply the automatic manipulation:** An automatic manipulation
is always a success, and is not affected by hindering.

## Thought

```
Complex thought works in the same way as complex manipulation.
Automatic thought works in the same way as automatic
manipulation.
```
## Movement

**1. Declare a movement**.
**2. Create the move point (MP) pool:** The MP pool equals 0 plus
bonuses from skills, traits and special rules.
**3. Add MP bonus for the first movement:** If this movement action
is the first of your turn for this miniature, add your MP bonus to
the MP pool.
**4. Choose move type:** The area where your miniature is located is
the start area. Choose the destination area. You cannot enter an
area if you would over-occupy it. A **simple move** crosses a white or
orange area boundary from one area to an adjacent area. A **special
move** is indicated in the board rules by a fall, jump, or climb
icon, and is always associated with a level.
Calculate the move cost:
    **Simple move:** 1 MP + hindering index of start area
    + total level of difficult terrain in the start area.
    **Special move:**
    **Fall:** 1 MP + hindering index of start area
    + total level of difficult terrain in the start area.

```
Jump: 1 MP + jump level + hindering index of start area
+ total level of difficult terrain in start area.
```
```
Climb: 1 MP + climb level + hindering index of start area
+ total level of difficult terrain in start area.
```
**5. Spend energy cubes:** If the move cost is higher than the MP
pool, you must spend energy cubes to the movement space to
buy the missing MPs. Each spent cube gives you as many MPs
as your movement characteristic: add these to your MP pool. If
the exertion limit of the movement space has been reached or if
you cannot buy the missing MPs, skip to the End Move step. You
cannot spend energy cubes on the movement space if you would
exceed its exertion limit.

```
If the move cost is equal or lower than the MP pool, proceed to
the next step.
```
**6. Spend MPs:** Subtract the cost of the move from the MP pool.
**7. Move the miniature** to the destination area.
**8. Apply the effects of the destination area:** If the miniature
performs a fall, roll the same number of yellow dice as the level of
the fall and then suffer wounds equal to the number of successes.
**9. End move:** If you wish to perform another move during this
movement action, return to the Choose Move Type step. If not, or
you cannot move again, continue to the End Movement step.
**10. End movement:** Reduce the MP pool to 0; you lose all unused
MPs and your movement ends.

## VILLAIN TURN

#### 1. UPKEEP VILLAIN

```
Move all energy cubes not in your fatigue or reserve zones to your
fatigue zone. Move a number of energy cubes from your fatigue
zone to your reserve zone equal to the mission’s recovery value.
```
#### 2. TRIGGER START OF VILLAIN TURN EFFECTS

```
Resolve any effects that trigger at the start of the villain turn.
If several happen simultaneously, choose the order.
```
#### 3. ACTIVATE THE FIRST TILE

```
You may activate 0-2 tiles per turn. If you activate at least 1 tile,
continue; otherwise skip to the Trigger End of Villain Turn Effects
step.
```
```
Choose a tile to activate in the river and spend its activation cost
(the number above the tile on the track) by moving that number
of energy cubes from your reserve zone to your fatigue zone. Move
the activated tile to the end of the river to the right, and slide the
remaining tiles to the left.
If you have chosen a character tile , activate any number of the tile’s
characters (or none, if you wish). Each of the characters controlled
by the tile can be activated once, and you must finish the activation
of a character before you move on to the next active character.
```
```
Each character has the option to move , then the option to carry
out an action (melee attack, ranged attack, manipulation, or
thought), then another option to move.
```
```
A character only gets the MP bonus the first time they move, and
once they stop, they lose any remaining MP bonus. You must
spend energy cubes to move further (up to the exertion limit).
```
```
A character may repeat their action as long as they have not
exceeded their multiplier value.
```
```
If you chose the event tile , you gain a number of reinforcement
points and must carry out the mission-specific events.
```
#### 4. ACTIVATE THE SECOND TILE

```
If you wish to activate a second tile, repeat the steps specified
above. If not, skip to the Trigger End of Villain Turn Effects step.
```
#### 6. TRIGGER END OF VILLAIN TURN EFFECTS

```
Resolve any effects that trigger at the end of the villain turn.
If several happen simultaneously, the villain chooses the order.
```

## DEFENSE

**1. Declare a defense**.
**2. Spend energy cubes:** Move a number of energy cubes from your
reserve zone to your defense space (min 0): this is your defense
intensity. You cannot spend energy cubes to the defense space if
you would exceed its exertion limit (if the limit has been reached,
move directly to the Add the Automatic Defense Dice step).
**3. Create the dice pool:** Take as many dice (your defense
characteristic specifies the color) as the amount of cubes spent.
**4. Add the automatic defense dice**.
**5. Roll the dice pool**.
**6. Rerolls:** You may attempt to improve the result by rerolling.
**7. Total successes:** Add any automatic defense successes.
Defense is not affected by hindering.
**8. Determine the number of wounds:** Subtract the number of
defense successes from the number of attacker successes. The
result is the number of wounds suffered by the defender.

## REROLLS

**1. Declare a reroll**.
**2. Free rerolls:** You may reroll 1 die of the specified color for every
reroll icon (of the same color) you have. A die can be rerolled for
free only once. You can use the free rerolls available to you; then
roll the dice of the free reroll.
**3. Declare any paid rerolls:** You may pay to carry out additional
rerolls. Choose 1 or more of the dice from the rolled dice pool
(these can come from the free rerolls carried out in the previous
step). If you do not want to reroll, end the rerolls.
**4. Spend energy cubes:** Move as many energy cubes as the
number of dice you wish to reroll to the reroll space. You cannot
spend energy cubes on the reroll space if you would exceed its
exertion limit (if the limit has been reached, the reroll ends).
**5. Roll the chosen dice:** Decide if you will continue to carry out
rerolls. If yes, return to the Declare Any Paid Rerolls step. If no,
end the rerolls.

## HINDERING

**If a miniature performs a move** , calculate the **hindering index**
based on the size indexes of the other miniatures present in the
area the miniature is leaving:

Hindering index (min 0) = Total size index of enemy miniatures –
Total size index of allied miniatures.

**If a miniature performs a ranged attack, a complex manipulation,
or a complex thought** , calculate the **hindering index** based on the
menace indexes of the other miniatures present in the action area:

Hindering index (min 0) = Total menace index of enemy
miniatures – Total menace index of allied miniatures.

In both cases, **do not include the miniature performing the action
in the calculation**.

## THE RIVER

#### REINFORCEMENT

As soon as the villain gains **reinforcement points** , they must be
spent.

A miniature with a reinforcement cost on its tile can be returned
to the game as a **reinforcement** if the villain spends the indicated
reinforcement points.

```
Take the miniature from the character pool and place
it in any of the reinforcement areas indicated in the
mission by this token.
```
```
A reinforced character must not over-occupy the area they are
placed in. If a character must come into play in an area that it
would over-occupy, it is placed in an adjacent area that it does
not over-occupy. If the adjacent areas are all over-occupied, the
character does not come into play.
Unspent reinforcement points are lost.
```
```
When a miniature of a neutralized (facedown) tile is brought back
into play, flip the tile faceup.
```
```
The character pool represents the miniatures the villain can
use as reinforcements. Unless otherwise indicated, the pool of
characters of a tile is 0. However, a mission may specify that
miniatures should be placed in this pool during setup.
```
#### DREDGING THE RIVER

```
Dredging the river is not an action and does not count as
activating a tile. At any moment during their turn, the villain
can dredge the river by removing 1 or more neutralized tiles and
placing them back in the box at a cost of 2 energy cubes per tile.
```
```
These cubes are removed from the game and must be taken
from the villain’s fatigue zone. If there are not enough cubes
in that zone, the villain can remove cubes from their spaces,
then from their reserve zone. There is no limit to the number of
neutralized tiles that can be removed from the river as long as
the villain has enough energy cubes to do so. The miniatures of a
tile thus removed cannot be brought back into play, even during
reinforcement.
```
#### DEMOBILIZATION

```
Demobilization is not an action and does not count as activating a
tile. Once per game, during their turn, the villain can demobilize
an elite or henchman character tile. Dredge the river of this tile as
though it was neutralized and remove all the miniatures under its
control from the board.
```
## EQUIPMENT

#### ENCUMBRANCE

```
Your encumbrance total is the total of the encumbrance values of
the equipment you are carrying, and determines your MP bonus.
It cannot exceed your maximum encumbrance value.
```
```
You can benefit from a skill only while your encumbrance total is
lower than the encumbrance limit of the skill.
```
#### PICKING UP EQUIPMENT

```
Picking up equipment is an automatic manipulation. You can
only pick up equipment if it is in your area and your maximum
encumbrance value is not exceeded when it is picked up.
During the Apply the Automatic Manipulation step, place the
picked-up equipment next to your hero board.
```
#### GIVING EQUIPMENT

```
Giving equipment is an automatic manipulation. Only the hero
who gives the equipment spends an energy cube.
```
```
To give equipment, the receiving hero must accept the
equipment, both heroes must be in the same area, and the
equipment must not cause the maximum encumbrance value of
the hero receiving it to be exceeded.
```
```
During the Apply the Automatic Manipulation step, the hero
receiving the equipment places it next to their hero board.
```
#### TAKING EQUIPMENT

```
Taking equipment is an automatic manipulation. Only the hero
receiving the equipment spends an energy cube.
```
```
To take equipment, the hero carrying the equipment must agree to
give it, both heroes must be in the same area, and the equipment
must not cause the maximum encumbrance value of the hero
taking it to be exceeded.
```
```
During the Apply the Automatic Manipulation step, the hero who
takes the equipment card places it next to their hero board.
```
#### THROWING EQUIPMENT

```
Throwing equipment is a complex manipulation. To perform this
action, you must have LOS to the target area.
```
```
During the Declare a Complex Manipulation step, calculate the
difficulty level of the throw: this is equal to the distance from your
area to the target area.
```
```
During the Calculate the Number of Successes step, subtract
the encumbrance value of the thrown equipment as well as any
possible hindering index from the number of successes obtained.
```
```
During the Apply the Complex Manipulation step, compare the
number of successes to the difficulty level of the throw: if the
number of successes is equal to or higher than the difficulty
level, place the equipment in the target area. If the number of
successes is lower, place the equipment at a distance equal to
the obtained number of successes, along the LOS towards the
target area.
```
#### DROPPING EQUIPMENT

```
Dropping equipment is not an action and does not require any
energy cubes to be spent. You can drop equipment at any time.
Place the card in your area.
```
#### BAT-GADGET CARDS

```
During mission setup, heroes with a utility belt can choose their
bat-gadgets from all the bat-gadgets available in the game. The
total of your bat-gadget sizes cannot exceed your utility belt’s size.
```
```
A bat-gadget is not included in your encumbrance total value.
You cannot pick up, give, take, throw or drop a bat-gadget.
```
## WOUNDS

```
When a hero is wounded, move the same number of energy cubes
as wounds suffered into their wound zone. These are first taken
from their fatigue zone, then from their spaces, and finally from
their reserve zone. A hero is neutralized when all their energy
cubes are in their wound zone.
```
```
When a character with several life points is wounded, the cube
used as the life point marker is moved down the same number
of spaces in the command post as wounds suffered. If the cube
reaches 0, the character is neutralized. When a character with
only 1 life point is wounded, they are neutralized.
```
```
Neutralized heroes can no longer perform actions. They must
choose a resting stance and their skills are no longer taken into
account for this turn.
```
```
Neutralized characters are removed from the board and placed
in the character pool. When all the characters of a tile have been
removed from the board, the tile is neutralized. Remove it, slide
the remaining tiles to the left, then replace it neutralized side
faceup at the end of the river on the right.
```
## OTHER EFFECTS

#### DISSIPATION

```
The triangular dissipation tokens have temporary effects then
dissipate. During the Trigger Start of Turn Effects step of the side
of the player who placed the token, if the token is active side
faceup, it is turned facedown with the dissipating side visible;
and if the token is dissipating side faceup, it is removed.
```
#### EXPLOSION

```
An explosion is an effect always associated with a level and a
target area determined by a skill or a special rule.
```
```
If the targeted area is not dangerous terrain, it becomes
dangerous terrain whose level is equal to that of the explosion.
```
```
If the targeted area is dangerous terrain, its level is increased by
the level of the explosion.
```
```
After having applied the wounds linked to the temporary increase
of the total level of the dangerous terrain, the total level of
dangerous terrain reverts to its initial value.
```
## GAME BOARDS

#### AREAS

```
Areas on the board are defined by these boundaries:
```
```
White boundaries allow LOS and simple moves.
Orange boundaries allow LOS and simple moves.
The two areas separated share LOS.
```
```
Special areas are indicated in the board rules, but are not
marked. They allow LOS but prevent simple moves.
Walls are indicated in the board rules, but are not marked.
They block LOS and prevent simple moves.
Two areas are adjacent if they are separated by a white or orange
area boundary.
```
```
An area’s level of elevation is indicated in the board rules.
```
```
Some areas have LOS markers to facilitate checking LOS.
```
```
A promontory is a high area defined in the board rules that is
accessible only be a special move and blocks LOS between 2
areas, regardless of their elevation level. However, LOS can begin
or end on a promontory without being blocked.
```
#### TERRAIN

```
Difficult terrain is always associated with a level.
Calculate the total level of difficult terrain by adding
together the different levels of difficult terrain in
the area. Some skills or special rules add levels of
difficulty to terrain by using tokens.
```
```
A miniature leaving a difficult terrain area must add the total level
to the move cost.
```
```
Dangerous terrain can wound miniatures that enter
it. Calculate the total level of dangerous terrain by
adding together the different levels of dangerous
terrain in the area. Some skills or special rules add
levels of danger to terrain by using tokens.
A miniature entering dangerous terrain area must roll a number of
yellow dice equal to the total level and suffer a number of wounds
equal to the number of successes.
```
```
If terrain becomes dangerous, a miniature present in the area
must immediately roll dice as above.
```
```
If the total level of the dangerous terrain increases , a miniature
present in the area must immediately roll the same number
of yellow dice as the increase in level and suffer a number of
wounds equal to the successes.
```
#### OVER-OCCUPATION

```
The total of the size indexes of the miniatures
present in an area can never exceed the area’s
occupation limit.
Check to see if an area is over-occupied by totalling the size
indexes of all the miniatures in the area and adding the size index
of the miniature wishing to move into the area.
```
```
If this total is greater than the area’s occupation limit, the
miniature over-occupies it. If a miniature must come into play in
an area that it over-occupies, place it in an adjacent area that it
does not over-occupy. If the adjacent areas are all over-occupied,
the miniature does not come into play.
```
