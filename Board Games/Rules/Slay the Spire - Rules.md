Rules Overview Video
 
Game Overview
Slay the Spire is a cooperative rogue-like deckbuilding adventure. Craft a unique deck, encounter bizarre creatures, discover relics of immense power, and finally become strong enough to defeat the boss at the end of the Act!

Slay the Spire is a Deckbuilder. That means each player starts with a simple deck of cards that they can improve by adding and removing cards during the game.  
Slay the Spire is also a rogue-like. That means that when you die (and you will die!), start over from the beginning. Take the lessons you learned and try again!

⦁	Pick Order – Gain rewards in any order you want!
⦁	Skip - You may skip gaining any reward below. You may also skip revealing or drawing from any rewards deck.
⦁	Full Knowledge - After revealing cards or items, you can look at what the other rewards are from that combat before making any final decisions on what to choose or skip. You can check upgrades. If you’re ever unsure if you’ll get to see another combat reward from your current room before finalizing a choice, the answer is yes.
⦁	Trading - Potions can be given to other players outside of combat. Nothing else can be traded. 
Card Reward – Reveal the top 3 cards of your card rewards deck and lay them out in front of you. You may add one revealed card to your deck or skip adding a card. Return any unselected cards to the bottom of your card rewards deck.
Golden Ticket – Whenever you reveal a Golden Ticket, reveal the top card of your rare rewards deck and add that to your choices. Unpicked rare cards return to the bottom of your rare rewards deck. Put the Golden Ticket on the bottom of your card rewards deck.
Upgraded Card Reward – This is just like a “card reward” above, but the card you pick is immediately upgraded (see Upgrade below). You can always look at what an upgrade does before choosing.
Rare Reward – Reveal 3 cards from your rare rewards deck and lay them out in front of you. You may add one to your deck or skip. Return any unselected cards to the bottom of your rare rewards deck.
Potion – Draw a card from the potion deck. You may gain that potion or skip it. Keep it face up in 
front of you until used. You can’t have more than 3 potions. Potions are all single-use items. When a 
potion is used, discarded, or skipped, put it on the bottom of the potion deck. If you gain a potion but you’re at the limit, you must either: skip the potion, pass the potion to a player who is below their potion limit, or discard or use a potion then gain the new potion. Gambler’s Brew, Entropic Brew, Blood Potion, and Fairy in a Bottle can be used outside of combat if applicable. 
Relic – Draw a card from the relic deck. You may gain that relic or skip it. Keep your relics face up in front of you. When relics are discarded or skipped, put them on the bottom of the relic deck. 
Boss Relic – Reveal 1 Boss relic per player + 1. Reveal 3 instead if playing solo. Each player may gain a relic or skip. Keep your Boss relics face up in front of you. When Boss relics are discarded or 
skipped, return them to the bottom of the Boss relic deck. 
Gold – Gain gold tokens equal to the value. Gold can be spent at the Merchant or certain Events. You can use your gold to pay for any amount of another player’s purchase at a Merchant or Event.  
Remove, Upgrade, Transform

⦁	Remove - Remove a card from your deck. Keep it in a removed pile away from your deck. 
⦁	Upgrade - Unsleeve a card in your deck and flip it to the upgraded side (has green text). You can check what a card’s upgrade is at any time by unsleeving it or checking the Upgrade Reference.
⦁	Transform - Remove a card from your deck that isn’t a Curse. Keep it in a removed pile away from your deck. Add the top card of your card rewards to your deck (it should be random). If it’s a Golden Ticket, add the top card of your rare rewards to your deck instead, then put the Golden Ticket on the bottom of your card rewards.

Event Card Elite

Combat Setup
Rows - Each player has a row. Enemies are placed in rows, except for Bosses. 
Summons  - Some enemies will summon more enemies. If you see a green bar and this icon  , then search for 
that enemy in the 
Summons deck and 
put them into play at the start of combat. Some enemy actions or special abilities can also summon.
Random Summons - When multiple Summons have the same name, select them randomly. You can do this by picking one without reading its abilities or shuffling Summons with the same 
name in a small face down pile and drawing one. “Gremlins” have a Gremlin icon on the back to help you select them randomly.

Combat Round - Player Turn
Combat rounds consist of a Player Turn followed by an Enemy Turn. Rounds repeat until combat ends.
Player Turn
Shuffle your deck before combat starts. There’s one shared Player Turn that’s broken into the phases below: Start of Turn, Play, End of Turn. All players take these steps simultaneously.
⦁	Start of Turn
1.	Reset - Set Energy  to 3 and Block to 0.
2.	Draw - Draw 5 cards. There is no maximum hand size.
Empty Draw Pile - When your draw pile is empty and you need to draw, your discard pile becomes the new draw pile. Shuffle it. If a card was just played that drew you cards, that card is set aside while you shuffle, then added to the new discard pile.
3.	Roll - Roll the die  . If any abilities can change the die result, they must be used now before resolving other abilities. The die result tells you what action some monsters will take later during the Enemy Turn and which relic abilities are about to trigger (see next step). One die result determines all die effects for the round! Don’t roll it again until next round!
4.	Start of turn abilities - The following abilities trigger in any order players choose: 
⦁	Start of turn - Abilities that have “Start of turn” or “Start of round” text.
⦁	Start of combat - These abilities only trigger on the first turn of combat. 
⦁	Die relic abilities - Abilities that trigger on the indicated die  result. 
⦁	Play
Players can play cards, use potions, and activate abilities in any order they choose. 
⦁	Discuss - Players can discuss strategy, such as which enemies to attack and which players need help. It is encouraged to announce if you have Weak   or Vulnerable  effects early in the turn, as well as to ask questions like, “How much damage do you have?” or “Do you have enough Block?” rather than look at a player’s hand. 
To play a card:
⦁	Pay - Pay the Energy  cost on the upper left of the card. Track Energy on your board. 
⦁	Choose - Make any decisions and choose targets for the card. You can target any enemy with your effects. Effects with a  symbol affect all enemies in one row and always affect the Boss.
⦁	Being Played - While the card is being played, it isn’t in your hand or in your discard pile.
⦁	Resolve - Execute the card’s printed effects from top to bottom. Any abilities triggered by the card don’t take effect until after the card is finished resolving all of its text.
⦁	Cleanup - The card goes to your discard pile. If it’s a Power, instead place it face up in front of you. If it Exhausts, it goes to your exhaust pile. (Note:  Exhaust to the deck they came from.)
⦁	End of Turn
When players are done playing cards, the following effects occur:
1.	End of turn abilities - Abilities that have an “End of turn” effect trigger in any order players choose. The phrase “End of turn” is only used to refer to the end of the Player Turn (never the Enemy Turn).
2.	Discard - Discard all cards in your hand in any order.
Combat Round - Enemy Turn
Enemy Turn
The Enemy Turn is broken into the phases: Remove Enemy Block, Enemy Actions, Move Cube Actions. 
1.	Remove Enemy Block - Enemies lose all of their leftover Block  tokens.
2.	Enemy Actions - Starting with the highest row, enemies act left to right taking one action 
each. Then enemies in the next row down act left to right. This continues until all enemies in all rows have acted once. Bosses always act last. Enemies that say “acts last” act after other enemies. See types of enemy actions below.
3.	Move Cube Actions - If an enemy uses Cube Actions (see below), slide their cube down the 
track. Then the combat round repeats.  
Enemy Action Types
Enemies target the player in their row. Actions with a  symbol target all players. There are 3 types of enemy behavior patterns:
Single Action - The enemy takes the listed action every turn.
Die Action - The enemy takes the action to the right of the die result. Cube Action - At the start of combat, put a cube in the top cube slot. 
The enemy takes the action to the right of the cube during the “Enemy Actions” phase. During the “Move Cube Actions” phase, slide the cube down the track. When it reaches the bottom of the track, move the cube to the topmost red cube slot. Gray cube actions are not repeated.
The Dead
When enemies are reduced to 0 HP, they are dead and lose their tokens. Flip them over until the end of combat. When a player dies, the game immediately ends in defeat. 
End of Combat
Combat ends immediately when all monsters are dead or have left combat, unless an enemy had an “on death” ability that is going to summon an enemy. At the end of combat:
1.	End of Combat Abilities - Abilities that say “End of combat” trigger now.
2.	Rewards - Players gain the rewards on the upper left of the enemy’s card (see page 8). In encounters, gain rewards from the enemy in the row you ended combat in. In Boss and Elite fights, all players gain the rewards.
3.	Reset Your Deck - Return your Powers, discard pile, and exhaust pile to your deck. Remove any  / and  cards from your deck and return them to their respective decks. 
4.	Reset Player Board - Reset the Block and Energy tracks. Lose all tokens ( ) except for gold. The Defect removes all Orbs. The Watcher enters Neutral Stance.
5.	Clear Enemies - Put  and  on the bottom of their respective decks. Summons return to the Summons deck. 
6.	Switch Rows - Players may switch rows anytime between now and before the next combat room.

When the Defect Channels an Orb, place an Orb of that type in an open Orb slot on the player board. Use yellow cubes for Lightning, blue cubes for Frost, and purple cubes for Dark. If a card Channels multiple Orbs, Channel them one at a time. If you Channel an Orb and don’t have any more cubes, ignore the effect.
End of Turn
At end of turn, gain the “End of turn” effect for each Lightning and Frost Orb as shown on the Defect player board. Choose targets for Lightning Orbs. They can each have a different target. 
Evoke
When an effect Evokes an Orb, remove an Orb of your choice from its slot and apply the Evoke effect for that type of Orb as written on the Defect player board. If you play Dual Cast, Evoke an Orb twice. Each Lightning and Dark Orb Evoke effect can have a different target.
Orb slots are full - If you Channel an Orb and all Orb slots are full, Evoke any Orb, then place the Channeled Orb in its slot. When multiple Orbs are Channeled at once, resolve this effect one Orb at a time.
How are Orbs different from the video game?
Do I have to Evoke the front Orb, like in the video game? Do Orbs rotate like in the video game? Do I have to Channel Orbs into a particular slot? 
No, no, and no. You can Channel an Orb into any empty Orb slot, and you can Evoke any Orb you have. All Orb slots are treated the same.
The Silent
A deadly huntress from the foglands. Eradicates foes with daggers and poisons.
Poison (max 30)
Place a Poison token  on a target for each  icon on the effect. At the end of turn, enemies with  lose 1 HP per  token they have. Losing HP ignores Block  (Poison  doesn’t deal damage). Don’t remove Poison  tokens from an enemy until they are dead. There can’t be more than 30 Poison  combined on all enemies.
Shivs (max 5)
Shivs are tokens that may be used to deal 1 whenever you could play a card. Each  is treated as a separate Attack and is affected separately by Strength , Vulnerable , and Weak  . You start combat with 0 Shiv tokens, and gain Shiv tokens from cards with the Shiv 
icon. They don’t go away until used or the end of combat. You can use them immediately or save them up for a combo! 
Note: If you’re out of Shiv tokens and you gain a Shiv  , you can deal Shiv damage immediately or skip gaining the Shiv. Shivs don’t count as cards.
The Watcher
A blind ascetic who has come to “Evaluate” the Spire. Master of the divine Stances. Miracles (max 5)
Miracle  tokens can be used any time to gain 1 Energy  . You can’t have more than 5  at once. Gain Miracle tokens from cards and abilities with the  icon. Your starting ability gives you a  . You can use Miracles to go over the Energy limit (max 6) if they are immediately used to pay for a card.
Scry & Retain - See the back of the rulebook for Scry and Retain descriptions. Stances
Start each combat in Neutral Stance. The Watcher can enter or leave Stances to gain different abilities. When you enter a Stance, move the cube to the new Stance. You cannot enter a Stance you are already in (the effect is ignored). 
Neutral - Start each combat in Neutral Stance. Neutral doesn’t grant any abilities. 
Calm - When you leave Calm, gain 2 Energy  . Wrath - While you are in Wrath, you deal +1 damage 
on all hits . This is effectively the same as having 1 Strength . This bonus only lasts until you leave Wrath. 
If you end your turn in Wrath, take 1 damage.  (Reminder: Damage can be blocked.)
FAQs & Random Rules
   Is there a maximum hand size?  No, there is no maximum hand size. 
   Can Block prevent an effect that says “Lose X HP”?  No. You can only block damage. Damage comes 
from hits  and “damage” effects. 
   What if we run out of tokens? If you run out of tokens, you can’t gain or apply more tokens. The effect 
is ignored. This is true whether it’s gaining gold, Strength  , or applying Poison . But keep in mind with Shivs  , you can use them immediately to deal damage (see Shivs on previous page). So a Shiv should never go to waste unless you want it to.
   Do cards remember? Cards have no memory once they leave your hand. Once they leave your hand, 
cards don’t know if they were Retained last turn, their cost changed, etc. However, cards with an ability that changes their own cost still have an effect while in the discard pile. So for example: While Streamline is in the discard pile with 2 Powers in play, it’s treated as costing 0. 
   Starter Strike vs “containing Strike”: what does this mean? A “starter Strike” is one of the Strikes in a 
starter deck. A card that “contains Strike” has the word “Strike” somewhere in its name.
   What happens if I Transform a colorless card? The added card comes from your card rewards deck.
   Do I remove any Weak  , Vulnerable  , and Poison  tokens at end of round? Nope. See back of 
rulebook for details. 
   Do Summons leave combat when all other enemies are killed? No. Unlike the video game, Summons 
don’t “flee” combat when the enemy that summoned them is killed. 
Specific Card Interactions
   Does Buffer prevent all HP loss from a multi-hit? HP loss from each hit  in a multi-attack can 
trigger Buffer separately.
   How do “play” effects like Distilled Chaos and Mayhem work with cards when they can’t be played 
like Clash, Signature Move, and Tactician? If an effect tries to play a card that can’t be played, ignore the effect and discard that card instead. 
   I played Corpse Explosion twice. What happens? The on death effect will only happen once.
   How does Dark Embrace work with Ethereal cards? When an Ethereal card Exhausts at end of turn, it 
triggers Dark Embrace and you draw a card. For cards you draw this way, ignore their “End of turn” and Ethereal abilities this turn. Don’t discard any cards you draw this way during the discard step.
   How do Dark Orbs work with cards like Consume? Consume boosts a Dark Orb’s damage by 2 (1 
because that’s the card’s effect, and 1 because it’s a Power). A Dark Orb’s “+1 damage for each Power you have in play” effect isn’t affected by abilities on cards like Consume or Amplify.
   Can I use Gambling Chip, The Abacus, or Toolbox at Events? Yes. “Once per room” abilities can be used 
at Events if applicable. 
   What happens if you play  with a Havoc, Mayhem, or Distilled Chaos? The  is Exhausted.    What happens if Snecko changes the Energy cost of a card, and that conflicts with other cost 
changes? Your next card is played for the Snecko cost, regardless of other cost change effects.
   How does Tantrum work with Rushdown? Any abilities triggered by a card don’t take effect until after 
the card has finished resolving all of its text (see “To play a card”, page 12). So Tantrum goes on top of your deck, then Rushdown triggers and you draw Tantrum again.
   Does Wrist Blade work with cards that temporarily cost 0 Energy? Yes, except it only works with 
copies if the original card was also played for 0 Energy (see Playing Copies on next page).
   During the Act IV Elite combat, can you switch into an empty row? Yes.
Cards from Other Characters
⦁	Tokens - You can use tokens from other characters the same way they do. The token limit remains the same, but it is shared between all players. 
⦁	Transform - When you Transform a card from another character or a colorless card, add the new card from the top of your character’s card rewards deck.
⦁	Golden Tickets - When you reveal a Golden Ticket from another character’s 
card rewards, the rare comes from that character’s rare deck.
⦁	Stances and Orbs - If you gain the ability to enter Stances or use Orbs from 
another character, gain the Prismatic Shard special relic. Start each combat 
in Neutral Stance. The Defect doesn’t gain more Orb slots this way. The 
Watcher can’t enter Stances on the Prismatic Shard. 
Playing Copies
When a card is played multiple times, each copy is treated as a separate card. Copies do not cost Energy to play. If the card has X in the Energy cost, the copies use the same value of X as the original. Each copy can have different targets and is affected separately by Vulnerable , Weak  , and single- use bonuses. Copies cannot also be copied. 
A card can only be affected by one effect that plays cards multiple times. Any additional effects that would play a card multiple times wait for the next valid card. For example: If you use two Skill Potions, then play a Skill, it is played twice. The 2nd Skill Potion has no effect until you play another Skill.
The copies are played first. While the copies are being played, the original isn’t in your hand or in your discard pile. When the original resolves, it then goes to your discard pile. 
Triggered Abilities
Some abilities don’t have an effect until the conditions of their trigger are met. Examples are: On death - When an enemy with this ability dies, the ability triggers. 
Start of turn - Relics and Powers with this phrase trigger at the start of the Player Turn (see Combat 
Round, page 12). Note that the Enemy Turn doesn’t have a “Start of Turn” phase.
Start of combat - These abilities are like “Start of turn” abilities, but only trigger turn 1 of combat. Start of next round - This refers to the “Start of Turn” phase during the next Player Turn. (See Combat 
Round page 12.) This trigger is found on some Bosses.
End of turn - Relics and Powers with this phrase trigger at the end of the Player Turn (see 
Combat Round, page 12). Note that the Enemy Turn doesn’t have an “End of Turn” phase.
End of combat - These abilities trigger at “End of combat” (see Combat Round, page 13). Once per combat - These abilities can only be used once per combat. Use them anytime 
during the Player Turn. Once used, flip the item face down. Flip it face up after combat.
Once per room - This ability is found on items that can only be used once per combat or 
Event. They typically alter the die result, and so can affect Events that use the die. Once used, flip the item over. Flip it face up after combat or when the party is done with the Event.
Die relic abilities  - These abilities trigger on a die result at the “Start of turn” (see  
page 12). These abilities are only found on relics  and Boss relics  . 
Unlocks 
Whenever you finish a game, each player checks 1 box per Boss defeated, plus 1 extra box each. You must check boxes for your character until they are all checked, after which you may check Colorless or Act IV boxes. When you check all of the boxes next to a lock, add the locked cards with a matching number    to the appropriate decks.

Golden Rule
Whenever a card’s text contradicts the rules, the card text takes precedence. 
Optional Rules
The Last Stand
When a player dies in a Boss fight, other players can continue fighting. Enemies in a row with a dead player target the nearest row with a player below them. If there are no players below them, they target the nearest row with a player above them. 
If at least one player survives, treat this as beating that Act (or the game, if it’s your final Act). If a player died, you cannot continue to the next Act. 
Sequential Turns
If simultaneous turns don’t work for your group, players can take Player Turns sequentially. 
Turn Order - The player that starts the round in the bottom lane (Lane 1) takes their Player Turn, followed by the player to their left. This continues until all players have taken a Player Turn. When all players have taken a Player Turn, the Enemy Turn begins. Rounds repeat like this until the end of combat.
The Die - The die is only rolled during the first Player Turn in a round.
Your Effects on Your Turn - Your abilities, die triggers, start of turn, and end of turn effects, etc. only happen on your Player Turn. This includes when you draw cards at the start of the turn, reset your Energy, and discard your hand.
Choose Your Relic
In multiplayer games, when the party gains a relic  from an Elite  or Treasure room, reveal relics equal to the number of players. Each player chooses a revealed relic.
