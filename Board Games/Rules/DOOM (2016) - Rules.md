### Why Play DOOM (2016) Over Doom (2004)

While the 2004 version has its merits and may appeal to fans of classic DOOM or those seeking a more traditional dungeon-crawl experience, the 2016 version offers a more modern, dynamic, and thematically consistent adaptation of the DOOM universe.

1. **Updated Mechanics:** DOOM (2016) features streamlined and modernized game mechanics, including a card-driven action system for marines and a more dynamic combat resolution, which can lead to faster-paced gameplay.

2. **Improved Balance:** The 2016 version offers better balance between marines and demons, with the Argent Power system giving the Invader player more strategic options throughout the game.

3. **Glory Kill System:** DOOM (2016) incorporates the Glory Kill mechanic from the video game, adding a tactical layer to combat and rewarding aggressive play.

4. **More Varied Missions:** The 2016 version includes a wider variety of mission objectives and scenarios, increasing replayability and strategic depth.

5. **Enhanced Asymmetry:** While both games feature asymmetric gameplay, DOOM (2016) emphasizes this aspect more strongly, with distinct playstyles for marines and the Invader.

6. **Improved Production Quality:** As a more recent release, DOOM (2016) likely features higher quality components, including more detailed miniatures and artwork that aligns with the modern DOOM aesthetic.

7. **Closer to Modern Video Game:** For fans of the DOOM video game franchise, the 2016 board game more closely mirrors the mechanics and feel of the recent video game releases.

8. **Streamlined Rules:** The 2016 version may be easier to learn and teach, with more intuitive rules that flow better during gameplay.

9. **Campaign Play:** DOOM (2016) offers a more robust campaign system, allowing for character progression and a connected narrative across multiple missions.

10. **Modern Game Design:** Benefiting from over a decade of board game design evolution, DOOM (2016) likely incorporates more refined mechanics and balancing techniques.

# DOOM (2016) - Rules
## SETUP

Assemble the map tiles and place all tokens on the map
following the chosen mission in the _Operation Guide_.

Read aloud the mission’s **objective card** and **threat card** and
place them in the play area. Return remaining objective and
threat cards to the box.

One player is the **invader** and all other players are **marines**.
Each marine takes a **marine card** , the corresponding **figure** ,
and one set of 4 **action cards** with the UAC Marine icon.

Shuffle the **class cards** and deal 2 to each marine. Each
marine chooses one to place faceup on the class card slot on
his marine card. Return unchosen and remaining class cards
to the box.

If playing with fewer than 4 marines, take **squad cards** :

**3 Marines:** Choose 1 marine to receive the _Taking Point_ card.

**2 Marines:** Both marines take a _Combat Veteran_ card.
**1 Marine:** The marine takes the _Solo Operative_ card.

Each marine chooses 2 different starting weapons from
among the **starting weapon tokens** (those without stripes).
Place these near your class card and take one corresponding
**weapon set** (3 action cards) for each of your weapon tokens.
Shuffle those action cards with your UAC Marine action cards
to form your 10 card **action deck** , placed facedown in your
play area. A marine cannot have multiple copies of the same
weapon.

The invader shuffles the **invasion cards** and draws 2, then
secretly chooses one and places it facedown in his play area.
He then takes each **demon card** that corresponds to a demon
on the invasion card and places it facedown in his play area.
Return unused invasion and demon cards facedown to the box.

The invader secretly chooses any 3 sets of **event cards** to
create an 18 card event deck. Return all remaining event
cards to the box.

Shuffle the **Glory Kill deck** and place it in the play area.

Separate all game tokens by type and place them in piles
to create the **supply**. Place all dice, condition cards, and
initiative cards near the supply.

The marines collectively choose the order in which they deploy
their figures. Each marine chooses an active **teleporter** on the
map and places his figure on or adjacent to that teleporter.

The mission ends immediately when either the invader or the
marines accomplish their objective.

At the end of a mission, marines discard all Glory Kill cards
and return any weapon sets they gained to the box. The
invader or the marines win an operation by being the first to
win 4 missions. If neither side wins 4 missions, the winner of
the final mission is the winner of the operation.

**Custom Operation:** the invader chooses one of the 12
missions in the _Operation Guide_ to be the first mission of
the operation. After each mission, the loser of that mission
chooses the next mission. The loser cannot choose a mission
that has already been played in this custom operation.

**Single Mission:** Choose any mission and follow the normal
setup rules. The winner of the mission wins the game. To
randomly select a mission, shuffle the objective cards, draw
one, and flip a coin. Play the mission that uses that objective
card: on heads, from _Operation: Black Bishop_ ; on tails, from
_Operation: Exodus_.

## GAME ROUND

```
Each round consists of 2 phases ; after both phases are
completed, play proceeds to the next round.
```
## STATUS PHASE

#### 1. PREPARE INITIATIVE DECK

```
The invader adds or removes cards from the initiative deck ,
shuffles it, and places it facedown in the play area.
```
```
The initiative deck includes 1 marine initiative card for each
marine in the game, and 1 invader initiative card for each
demon type that has at least one figure on the map.
```
```
If playing with only one marine, the deck includes that
marine’s initiative card plus one other marine initiative card
to act as that marine’s second initiative card.
```
#### 2. READY DEMONS

```
The invader readies each of his exhausted demon cards.
```
#### 3. DRAW EVENT CARDS

```
The invader draws event cards until he has 6 in his hand.
```
#### 4. GAIN ARGENT POWER

```
The invader may discard up to 3 event cards from his hand
to gain a number of Argent Power tokens equal to the number
of those discarded cards. Place these on the invader’s
invasion card or on a faceup demon card.
```
## ACTIVATION PHASE

```
All players take turns activating their figures in an order
determined by the initiative deck. Resolve the following
2 steps repeatedly until the initiative deck is depleted:
```
#### 1. REVEAL INITIATIVE CARD

```
The top card of the initiative deck is revealed to all players.
If there were none remaining, the Activation Phase ends.
```
#### 2. ACTIVATE

```
Marine Activation
If a marine initiative card is revealed, the corresponding
marine activates.
```
```
If you were fragged and not on the map, you respawn at the
start of your activation on an active teleporter of your choice.
```
```
Ready your class card if it is exhausted.
Then, you may resolve up to 1 main action and any
number of bonus action s (in any order desired). Most
actions are resolved by playing action cards; you must resolve
the entire card before resolving any others. You can play
bonus actions even if you do not resolve a main action.
```
```
Play the action card faceup and gain movement points (MPs)
equal to the card’s speed value. If the card has an attack box ,
you may perform that attack.
```
```
After you finish resolving actions, discard all your played
action cards and draw new ones from your deck until you
have a number in hand equal to your hand size (usually 3).
```
```
Reactions are a type of action that allow a marine to
interrupt the game and play cards outside of his activation.
```
```
Demon Activation
If an invader initiative card is revealed, the invader exhausts
1 demon card of his choice and activates each demon
matching that card’s type, one at a time. That demon type
cannot be activated again until its demon card is readied.
```
```
An activated demon gains MPs equal to the speed value
on its demon card. It may perform 1 attack and spend any
number of MPs.
```
## MOVEMENT

```
A figure can spend 1 MP to move to an adjacent space (a
space that shares a border or corner). A figure must spend 1
additional MP to move into a space of difficult terrain.
```
```
Movement points can be spent at any time during a figure’s
activation except during an attack, but any not spent by the
end of the figure’s activation are lost.
```
```
A figure cannot move across a border that is impassable
terrain, blocking terrain, a wall, or a door.
```
```
A figure cannot move to a space sharing only a single corner
unless one of the other spaces also sharing that corner is
adjacent to both the figure’s space and the diagonal space.
```
```
A figure can move into a space containing another figure, but
must spend an additional MP to move into a space occupied
by an enemy figure. However a small figure cannot end its
movement in a space occupied by another figure.
If a marine moves into a space occupied by an enemy figure
and that enemy figure is staggered , that marine performs a
Glory Kill.
```
```
A figure can spend 1 MP point to open an adjacent door.
```
```
If a figure gains MPs, but that figure is not currently resolving
its activation, it may immediately spend those points. Then,
any points that it did not spend are lost.
```
```
Sprint: Marines may use the Sprint action on their marine
card: during your activation, instead of playing a main action
card, you may discard 1 card from your hand to gain 6 MPs.
```
## ATTACK

#### 1. DECLARE DEFENDER

```
The attacker declares which figure he is attacking (the
defender ). The defender must be an enemy figure within
range and in line of sight (LoS) of the attacker.
```
```
Range is the number of spaces between the attacker and
the defender, including the defender’s space. The maximum
range of an attack is shown in its attack box.
```
```
To determine if the defender is in LoS , the attacker chooses
one corner of his figure’s space and draws a straight,
imaginary line to any corner of the defender’s space. If the
line crosses a wall, door, or blocking terrain, LoS is blocked
and the attacker must declare a different target. Figures do
not block LoS.
```
```
Determine if the defender has cover from the attack. The
attacker draws an imaginary line from the same corner of
his space he used to determine LoS to each corner of the
defender’s space (if the attacker’s corner is shared by the
defender, the defender cannot have cover). If any of the lines
are drawn through a wall, difficult terrain, blocking terrain,
or spaces containing a figure (other than the attacking and
defending figures), the defender has cover. Large or stunned
figures cannot have cover.
```
#### 2. ROLL DICE

```
If the attacker is a marine, the number and color of dice he
rolls is shown in the attack box on his action, class, or Glory
Kill card. If the attacker is a demon, the number and color of
dice he rolls is shown in the attack box on his demon card.
```
#### 3. REVEAL DEFENSE

```
If the defender is a marine, he reveals a defense card from
the top of his action deck. If the defender is a demon, he
reveals a defense card from the top of his event deck.
```
```
If the defender has cover , after revealing a defense card, he
may ignore and discard it and reveal another card (which he
must use).
```
```
If you cannot reveal a defense card because your deck is
depleted, shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck. Then
reveal a defense card from that deck.
```
```
If your deck is depleted and there are no discarded cards, you
cannot reveal a defense card.
```
#### 4. APPLY ‘WHILE DEFENDING’ EFFECTS

```
The defender can modify the result of the attack by using
abilities on cards that read while defending.
```
#### 5. APPLY ‘WHILE ATTACKING’ EFFECTS

```
The attacker can modify the result of the attack by using
abilities on cards that read while attacking.
```
#### 6. ASSESS DAMAGE

```
Both players determine the results of the attack. Then the
revealed card is discarded.
```
```
The number of shield icons on the revealed card is
subtracted from the number of damage icons on the dice.
```
```
For each damage icon remaining, the defender suffers 1
damage.
```
```
If the defender revealed a dodge icon , all damage is
canceled.
```
```
The special defense icon triggers the special defense
ability shown on the corresponding demon card, which
provides the defending demon with a number of shield icons
or a dodge icon.
A demon with toughness (a next to its health value) always
adds 1 to its defense, even if it did not reveal a defense
card.
```
```
Track damage with damage tokens : for marines, on their
marine card; and for demons, on the map next to the figure.
```
## FRAGGED

```
If a figure suffers damage equal to or greater than its health
value , that figure is immediately fragged.
```
```
A fragged demon is removed from the map. If all demons of
the same type are fragged, the invader flips the corresponding
demon card facedown and returns any Argent Power tokens
on that card to the supply.
```
```
A fragged marine is removed from the map and placed on its
marine card; discard all damage on the card. Shuffle both
your hand of cards and your discard pile into your action deck
and draw action cards until you reach your hand size.
```
```
The invader gains 1 frag token each time a marine is
fragged.
```
```
A fragged marine respawns on the map at the beginning of
his next activation. You can resolve your class card abilities
even if you were fragged and have not yet respawned, and you
do not lose any weapon sets from your action deck.
```
## STUN

```
If a marine becomes stunned , he takes a Stunned
card and places it by his marine card.
```
```
If a demon becomes stunned, place a stunned token
next its figure.
```
```
A stunned figure cannot reveal a card to defend against an
attack and cannot have cover.
```
```
Before rolling dice for an attack, a stunned figure must
choose and remove 1 die.
A figure is no longer stunned after it performs an attack
or after it is attacked. While a figure is stunned, it
cannot become stunned again.
```

## GLORY KILL

When a demon has suffered a number of damage equal to or
greater than its **stagger value** , it becomes **staggered**.

If a marine moves into a space occupied by a staggered
demon (remember to spend an additional MP for the move),
that marine performs a **Glory Kill**. The demon is instantly
fragged. Then, the marine draws 1 **Glory Kill card** and
recovers 2 damage as noted on the card. The card is then
placed facedown in the marine’s play area until he decides to
use it (he can have any number of them).

Card effects that reduce a demon’s stagger value are
cumulative, except for reductions to the printed stagger
value, in which case only the greatest reduction to the printed
stagger value is applied.

A marine may spend any unused MPs after performing a
Glory Kill.

Glory Kill cards are not discarded when a marine is fragged.

Telefragging a demon that is staggered is treated as a Glory
Kill.

## ARGENT POWER

The invader may spend **Argent Power** to trigger abilities with
the Argent Power icon. Argent Power tokens are placed
on faceup demon cards and the invasion card (these can
have any number of tokens on them). You cannot gain Argent
Power tokens if there are none left in the supply.

To resolve a demon card ability with Argent Power icons,
discard Argent Power tokens from that card equal to the
number of the ability’s Argent Power icons.

When the invader summons an invasion group with an Argent
Power icon and a corresponding value, he gains that number
of Argent Power tokens and must distribute them among his
demon cards from that group.

After summoning an invasion group, the invader can move
any number of Argent Power tokens stored on his invasion
card to demon cards of that invasion group. Any Argent Power
tokens that remain on the invasion card are discarded.

## ITEMS

Each item represented by a token that occupies one space on
the map. If a marine occupies the same space as an item, he
may gain that item (no MPs are spent); but a marine cannot
gain an item during an attack.

```
Health Pack: When a marine gains a health pack, he
removes it from the map and immediately recovers
5 damage.
```
```
Weapons: When a marine gains a weapon, he
moves the token to his play area, then takes the
matching set of action cards, shuffles it, and
places it facedown on the top of his action deck.
```
#### GRENADES

Each grenade is a single-card weapon set with a
corresponding weapon token. When a marine adds a grenade
weapon set to his action deck, he places that token faceup
(icon with stripes) in his play area.

When a marine uses a grenade action card, he places the
corresponding token facedown (illustration) on the map as
directed by the card: this token is not considered a weapon
token.

When a grenade token is reclaimed (following the card
instructions), the marine returns the weapon token faceup to
his play area.

A marine cannot have multiple copies of the same grenade.

## TERRAIN, WALLS AND DOORS

```
A group of contiguous, adjacent spaces that are completely
surrounded by either a colored border or a combination of
colored borders and walls share a terrain type. The borders of
each of those spaces are treated as that color.
```
```
Difficult Terrain (dotted blue line)
A figure must spend 1 additional MP to enter a space of
difficult terrain. If a space of difficult terrain contains an
enemy figure, spend 2 additional MPs to enter that space.
Difficult terrain does not block LoS but does provide cover.
```
```
Large figures ignore difficult terrain when moving.
```
```
Blocking terrain (solid red line)
Figures cannot move through blocking terrain.
```
```
Two spaces that share only a border of blocking terrain are not
adjacent. Two diagonal spaces whose shared corner is blocking
terrain are not adjacent unless one of the other spaces sharing
that corner is adjacent to both diagonal spaces.
```
```
Blocking terrain blocks LoS and provides cover.
```
```
A figure displaced by a game effect cannot be moved through
blocking terrain.
```
```
Large figures ignore blocking terrain when moving, and can
both enter and end their movement in spaces outlined by a
solid red line.
```
```
Impassable Terrain (dotted red line)
Figures cannot move through impassable terrain.
```
```
Two spaces that share only a border of impassable terrain are
not adjacent. Two diagonal spaces whose shared corner is
impassable terrain are not adjacent unless one of the other
spaces sharing that corner is adjacent to both diagonal
spaces.
Impassable terrain does not block LoS and does not provide
cover.
```
```
A figure displaced by a game effect cannot be moved through
impassable terrain.
```
```
Large figures ignore impassable terrain when moving, and can
both enter and end their movement in spaces outlined by a
dotted red line.
```
```
Walls (thick black line)
Figures cannot move through walls, and they block LoS. The
edges of each map tile are walls.
```
```
Two spaces separated by a wall are not adjacent. Two
diagonal spaces whose shared corner is the junction of two
walls are not adjacent unless one of the other spaces sharing
that corner is adjacent to both diagonal spaces.
```
```
Doors
If either a marine or demon is adjacent to a door, it can open
that door by spending 1 MP. Remove the door the map: it
cannot be closed again.
```
```
If a space’s border is a door, a figure that occupies that space
is adjacent to that door.
```
```
A closed door functions like a wall: it blocks LoS and figures
cannot move through it.
```
```
Flying
Demons with the Flying ability:
```
- can move into spaces of difficult terrain or those occupied
    by enemy figures without spending additional MP.
- can move through and end their movement in impassable
    terrain, or spaces surrounded by blocking terrain.
- cannot move through walls or closed doors.
- ignore terrain when summoned.

```
If a demon with Flying occupies a space that is completely
surrounded by blocking terrain (or is part of a group of spaces
completely surrounded by blocking terrain), marines can draw
LoS and measure range to that demon’s space. The borders of
the space(s) do not provide cover for that demon.
```
## PORTALS & SUMMONING

```
To summon demons, the invader follows these steps. If you
do not have enough figures of that demon type available, you
cannot summon that demon.
```
#### 1. CHOOSE A PORTAL

```
Choose a faceup portal token on the map. Each mission’s
threat card describes how facedown portals are flipped faceup.
```
#### 2. CHOOSE INVASION GROUP

```
Choose one of the two invasion groups from your invasion card
that corresponds to the portal you chose (blue, yellow, or red).
```
#### 3. PLACE DEMONS

```
In descending order, for each demon type in the invasion
group, place a number of demon figures equal to the number
listed for that demon type.
```
```
Summon figures one at a time, flipping its corresponding
demon card faceup if it was not faceup already.
```
```
If a figure cannot be placed either on or adjacent to a portal
because all the spaces are occupied, you must place it in the
nearest unoccupied space from the portal (count only spaces
the figure could move to following normal movement rules).
If the figure is large, it must be placed as close to the portal
as possible without displacing figures.
```
```
Large figures and demons with the Flying ability ignore terrain
when summoned.
```
#### 4. GAIN ARGENT POWER

```
You gain Argent Power equal to the number in front of the
Argent Power icon in the invasion group. You must place
the Argent Power tokens on demon cards that correspond to
the demons listed in the group.
```
#### 5. DISCARD PORTAL TOKEN

```
After you place each figure in your chosen invasion group on
the map, discard the portal token unless instructed otherwise.
After summoning an invasion group, you may move any
number of Argent Power tokens from the invasion card to the
corresponding demon cards. Then, any Argent Power tokens
that remain on the invasion card are discarded.
```
## TELEPORTERS

```
Some teleporters are inactive and must be activated before
they can be used. When a marine enters a space occupied by
an inactive teleporter, that teleporter immediately becomes
active and is flipped to its active side.
```
```
Fragged marines can respawn on any active teleporter. For the
purposes of marine movement, all spaces containing active
teleporters are adjacent to each other.
```
#### TELEFRAGGING

```
If a demon occupies a space that contains an active
teleporter, and a marine either respawns on that teleporter or
moves to that teleporter from another active teleporter, that
demon is immediately fragged (an additional MP to move into
the space is not required).
```
```
Telefragging a demon that is staggered is a Glory Kill.
```
```
When a marine respawns on an active teleporter that is
occupied by another marine, the respawning marine is placed
on the nearest unoccupied space relative to the teleporter.
```
## LARGE FIGURES

```
A small figure occupies one space on the map and a large
figure occupies multiple spaces.
```
```
Large figures cannot move diagonally.
```
```
After a large figure moves, each portion of its base must
occupy a space that is adjacent to the space it previously
occupied. However, those that occupy either 2 or 6 spaces
can rotate their bases 90º by spending 1 MP. The figure’s
base must occupy at least half of the spaces it occupied prior
to rotating.
```
```
Large figures ignore the effects of terrain when moving
and being summoned, and they do not have to spend any
additional MPs when entering spaces occupied by small
figures.
Large figures can end their movement in spaces containing
blocking terrain, impassable terrain, and small figures; but
not on a space occupied by another large figure.
```
```
When a large figure ends its movement in a space with one
or more small figures, each small figure is placed in the
nearest unoccupied space of its controller’s choice (but not
spaces they could not move to using normal movement rules).
Demons are moved first, followed by marines.
When a large figure is either an attacker or defender, LoS can
be determined using corners from any space that the figure
occupies. Large figures cannot have cover.
```
```
If a space that a large figure occupies is completely
surrounded by blocking terrain, figures can draw LoS and
measure range to that space.
```
## EXHAUSTED

```
An exhausted card is turned 90º to the horizontal. It cannot
be exhausted again until it is readied.
```
```
If a class card is exhausted, any abilities on that card that do
not require the player to exhaust the card can still be used.
```
## OBJECTIVE TOKEN

```
Objective tokens are generic tokens used during some
missions.
```
```
If a figure with an objective token is fragged, the
token is placed in the figure’s space. If it was a large figure,
the marines place the token in any space that the figure
occupied.
```
```
If an objective token would be placed in blocking or
impassable terrain, the marines instead place it in the
nearest legal space.
```
## WEAPONS

```
A weapon set is a collection of action cards that represent a
particular weapon.
```
```
The lower-right corner of each action card has a set identifier
that contains a weapon icon and color (identifying the set), a
card number (left of slash), and a set number. If cards share
the same name and effect but have a different card number,
multiple copies of the same card (by name) are in that set.
```
```
A marine’s action deck cannot contain multiple copies of the
same weapon set.
```
```
When a marine gains a weapon token during the game, he
shuffles the cards from the corresponding weapon set and
places them facedown on top of his action deck.
The corresponding weapon tokens in a marine’s play
area allow other players to see which weapons he
has in his action deck.
```

## STATUS PHASE

#### 1. PREPARE INITIATIVE DECK

The invader adds or removes cards from the **initiative deck**
and shuffles it, and places it facedown in the play area.

**1 marine:** add a second marine card.

#### 2. READY DEMONS

The invader readies each of his exhausted demon cards.

#### 3. DRAW EVENT CARDS

The invader draws event cards until he has 6 in his hand.

#### 4. GAIN ARGENT POWER

The invader may discard up to 3 event cards from his
hand to gain that number of **Argent Power tokens** to place
on the invasion card or on a faceup demon card.

## ACTIVATION PHASE

All players take turns activating their figures in an order
determined by the initiative deck.

#### 1. REVEAL INITIATIVE CARD

If there were none remaining, the Activation Phase ends.
