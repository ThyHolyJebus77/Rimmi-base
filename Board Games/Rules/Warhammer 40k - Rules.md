3. Turn Phases:
   - Move: Move your units up to their Movement value.
   - Shoot: Your units can fire at enemy units they can see.
   - Charge: Your units can attempt to move into close combat.
   - Fight: Units in close combat attack each other.

4. Rolling Dice:
   - Most actions require rolling dice.
   - Usually, you need to roll equal to or higher than a target number to succeed.

5. Winning:
   - Score points by controlling objectives and destroying enemy units.
   - The player with the most points after 5 rounds wins.

6. Key Concepts:
   - Each unit has stats like Movement, Toughness, and Wounds.

# Warhammer 40k - Rules
## BASICS

Each player commands an army of models that move and fight
in units (a group of models from the same datasheet). Friendly
models/units are all models/units in the same army, and enemy
models/units are all models/units in your opponent’s army.

Unit coherency: A unit must be set up and finish any move as
a single group, with all models within 2" horizontally and 5"
vertically of at least 1 other model from that unit. If a unit has 7+
models, all models must be within the same distance of at least
2 other models. Models added to a unit during the battle must
always be set up in unit coherency; any models that cannot be
set up are destroyed. At the end of each turn, if your unit is not in
unit coherency, you must remove models until it is.

Engagement range: While a model is within 1" horizontally and
5" vertically of an enemy model, those models (and their units)
are within engagement range of each other. Models cannot
be set up or end a normal, advance, or fall back move within
engagement range of enemy models. If a model cannot do so, it
is destroyed.

Measuring: Measure distances whenever you wish. Distances
are in inches (") between the closest points of the model bases
(or any part of the model if it has no base). If a rule applies
‘within’ a distance, it applies at any distance that is not more
than the specified distance.

Visibility: Use true line of sight (LOS) from a model to determine
visibility. A model can see through other models in its unit, and a
model’s base is also part of a model. If any part of another model
can be seen, it is visible to the observer. If one or more models in
a unit are visible, then that unit is visible. If every part of another
model facing the observer can be seen, the model is fully visible
to the observer. If every model in a unit is fully visible, that unit
is fully visible (the observer can see though other models in the
unit it is observing).

Dice: Re-rolls are applied before modifiers, and a die can never
be re-rolled more than once. You must re-roll all dice if several
are being added together. Unmodified dice refers to the result
after re-rolls, but before modifiers.

If players must roll-off, each rolls a D6 and whoever scores
highest wins. On a tie, roll again.

Sequencing: If 2 or more rules must be resolved at the same
time, the player whose turn it is chooses the order. If this occurs
before or after the battle or at the start or end of a battle round,
roll off and the winner chooses.

Starting strength: The number of models a unit has when it
is added to your army is its starting strength. If a unit has a
starting strength of 1, it is below half-strength while its remaining
number of wounds is less than half its WOUNDS. For any other
unit, while the number of models in that unit is less than half of
its starting strength, it is below half-strength.

The starting strength of an attached unit (a Leader character
merged with a Bodyguard unit) is equal to its combined starting
strength. If either unit is destroyed, the starting strength of the
remaining unit changes to its original starting strength. Rules
that trigger when a unit is destroyed trigger when one of the
units making up an attached unit is destroyed.

When a model is destroyed, it is removed from the battlefield.
When all models in a unit are destroyed, that unit is destroyed.

## THE BATTLE ROUND

A game is a series of battle rounds, each consisting of 2 turns,
one per player. The same player (specified by the mission) always
takes the first turn each round. A turn is divided into phases.

## COMMAND PHASE

## 1. COMMAND

```
Both players gain 1 command point (CP). Then, resolve any
other rules that occur in the command phase. Outside of the CP
players gain at this time, each player can only gain a total of 1 CP
per battle round, regardless of the source.
```
## 2. BATTLE-SHOCK

```
You must take a battle-shock test for each of your units on the
battlefield that is below half-strength. Roll 2D6: if the result
equals or exceeds the unit’s best LEADERSHIP, the test is passed.
```
```
If the test is failed, that unit is battle-shocked until the start of
your next command phase. While a unit is battle-shocked:
```
- The OBJECTIVE CONTROL of all its models is 0.
- If it falls back, you must make a desperate escape test for
    every model in that unit.
- Its controlling player cannot use stratagems to affect that unit.

## MOVEMENT PHASE

## 1. MOVE UNITS

```
Select 1 of your units to make a normal move, advance, or
remain stationary. A unit within engagement range of any enemy
models can only choose to remain stationary or fall back. In an
order of your choice, continue selecting units in your army and
moving them until you have done so with all of your units.
```
```
You can move some or any of a unit’s models. You can pivot a
model and/or change its position along any path, but no part
of its base can be moved across an enemy model, or cross the
edge of the battlefield. It can be moved over friendly models as if
they were not there, but it cannot end its move on top of another
```
#### model. MONSTER or VEHICLE models, however, must move

#### around friendly MONSTER or VEHICLE models.

```
Measure the movement distance using the part of the model’s
base (or part of the model itself if it doesn’t have a base) that
moves furthest along its path.
A unit must finish any move in unit coherency. If it cannot, the
move cannot be made. No unit can be selected to move more
than once in each movement phase.
```
#### REMAIN STATIONARY

```
None of the unit’s models can be moved for the rest of the phase.
```
#### NORMAL MOVE

```
Each model in the unit can move a distance in inches equal to
or less than its MOVE (M), but no model can be moved within
engagement range of enemy models.
```
#### ADVANCE

```
Roll a D6 advance roll for the unit, and add the result to the M
of each model until the end of the phase. Each model can then
move up to this total distance, but none can be moved within
engagement range of enemy models. A unit cannot shoot or
declare a charge in the same turn it advanced.
```
#### FALL BACK

```
Each model in the unit can move in inches up to its M. While
doing so it can move within engagement range of enemy models,
but cannot end the move within engagement range of any enemy
models (if this is not possible, it cannot fall back). A unit cannot
shoot or declare a charge in the same turn that it fell back.
```
```
Models can fall back over enemy models as if they were
not there, but you must make a desperate escape test for
```
#### each model that does so (unless they are TITANIC or can F LY )

```
before any models in that unit are moved. Also,if a unit is
battle-shocked when it chooses to fall back, you must make a
desperate escape test for every model in that unit before any
are moved. The same model can only ever trigger 1 desperate
escape test per phase.
```
```
Desperate escape test: Roll D6. For each result of 1-2, 1 model
from the unit that is falling back (your choice) is destroyed.
```
#### TERRAIN

```
Models can move over terrain features but not through them.
```
```
A model may move over terrain features 2" or less in height as if
they were not there. A model may climb up or down any higher
terrain features, counting the vertical distance up and/or down
as part of its move, but if the move would end mid-climb, that
move cannot be made.
```
#### FLYING

```
When moving normally, advancing, or falling back, a model
```
#### that can F LY can move over enemy models as if they were not

```
there, and can move within engagement range of enemy models.
Measure the movement ‘through the air’ if necessary if it starts
or ends the move on a terrain feature.
```
#### MONSTER or VEHICLE models that can F LY can move over other

#### MONSTER or VEHICLE models. Models that can F LY cannot end

```
their move on top of another model or within engagement range
of any enemy models.
```
## 2. REINFORCEMENTS

```
If you have any reserves units, you can select any of them and
set them up on the battlefield, one at a time. Reserves always
count as having made a normal move in the turn they are setup,
so cannot move further that phase. Otherwise, they can act
normally this turn.
Any reserves units that have not been set up on the battlefield
when the battle ends count as destroyed.
```
## SHOOTING PHASE

```
Select your eligible units one at a time and shoot with them.
Units that advanced or fell back this turn cannot shoot, and
each unit can only be selected to shoot once per phase.
```
```
Each time a unit shoots, declare the enemy units that will be the
targets, which models will target them, and with which weapons.
If any weapons have more than 1 profile, you must also declare
which profile is being used.
```
```
You can only select an enemy unit as a target if at least 1 model is
both within range of that weapon (the distance is equal to or less
than the weapon’s RANGE) and visible to the attacking model.
```
```
A model with more than 1 ranged weapon can shoot all at the
same target, or shoot each at different targets, but it cannot split
attacks from the same weapon across more than 1 target.
A unit with more than 1 model can shoot at the same or different
targets.
Each time a model shoots, it makes a number of attacks equal to
the ATTACKS of that weapon. Make 1 hit roll for each attack.
If attacking multiple units, resolve all the attacks against 1
target before moving on to the next. If a unit shoots with multiple
weapons, all attacks made with weapons with the same profile
must be resolved before resolving any other attacks.
```
```
Provided at least 1 model in the target unit was visible and
in range of the shooter when that target was selected, that
weapon’s attacks can still be made, even if none of the models
remain visible or in range when you resolve them.
A unit cannot shoot while it is within engagement range of any
enemy models. An enemy unit within engagement range of any
friendly units cannot be selected as a target of ranged weapons.
```
#### LONE OPERATIVE

#### Unless part of an attached unit, a LONE OPERATIVE unit can only

```
be selected as a target if the attacking model is within 12".
```
#### STEALTH

```
If every model in a unit has Stealth, then each time a ranged
attack is made against it, subtract 1 from that attack’s hit roll.
```
#### MONSTERS AND VEHICLES

#### MONSTER and VEHICLE units may shoot even within engagement

```
range of enemy units, and their ranged weapons can target enemy
units they are in engagement range of, even if other friendly
units are also within engagement range of that enemy unit.
```
#### Each time a MONSTER or VEHICLE unit makes a ranged attack,

```
if it is within engagement range of any enemy units when it
selected its targets (and unless that attack is made with a
pistol), subtract 1 from the hit roll.
```
#### You can select an enemy MONSTER or VEHICLE unit within

```
engagement range of any units from your army as a target. Unless
that attack is made with a pistol, subtract 1 from the hit roll.
```
## CHARGE PHASE

```
Select any eligible units from your army one at a time to declare
a charge into close combat. Each can only be selected once per
phase. A unit is eligible to charge if it is within 12" of any enemy
units at the start of your charge phase. Units that advanced or
fell back this turn, are within engagement range of any enemy
```
#### models, or are AIRCRAFT , are not eligible.

```
After selecting a unit, select one or more enemy units within 12"
of it as the targets of that charge (they do not need to be visible).
```
```
Make a 2D6 charge roll for the charging unit. The result is the
maximum number of inches each model in the unit can be
moved if a charge move is possible, and must be sufficient to
enable the charging unit to end that move:
```
- Within engagement range of every unit that you selected
    as a target of that charge;
- Without moving within engagement range of any enemy
    units that were not a target of the charge; and
- In unit coherency.

```
If any of these conditions cannot be met, the charge fails and
no models in the charging unit move this phase. Otherwise,
the charge is successful: move the models in the charging unit
a number of inches up to the result of the charge roll, so that
each model ends its move closer to one of the target units. If
you can also move a model in base-to-base contact with one
or more enemy models while still enabling the unit to satisfy all
the charging conditions above, you must do so. The controlling
player chooses the order in which to move their models.
Models can charge over terrain, but not through it. They can
move over terrain features 2" or less in height as if they were not
there, and can move vertically up, down, and over taller features,
counting the vertical distance as part of the charge move.
Models cannot end a charge move mid-climb, and if they cannot
make a charge move without doing so, the charge fails.
```
#### When a model that can F LY starts or ends a charge move on a

```
terrain feature, measure its path ‘through the air’. It can also
move over other models as if they were not there, but cannot end
any move on top of another model.
```
#### CHARGE BONUS: When a unit makes a charge move, until the end

```
of the turn, it has the Fights First ability.
```
## FIGHT PHASE

```
Starting with the player whose turn is not taking place, players
alternate selecting an eligible unit from their army to fight.
A player cannot pass or opt not to fight when they have any
units that are eligible to fight. A unit is eligible if it is within
engagement range of an enemy unit and/or it made a charge
move this turn. No unit can fight more than once in the fight
phase. If all of one player’s eligible units have fought, the
opposing player can then fight with their remaining eligible units,
one at a time.
```
```
After an enemy unit has fought and finished its consolidation
move, previously ineligible units may become eligible, and can
then be selected to fight.
```

## 1. FIGHTS FIRST

All eligible units with the Fights First ability (every model in the
unit must have it), including those that charged this turn, fight.

## 2. REMAINING COMBATS

All remaining eligible units fight, including any units with the
Fights First ability that were not eligible to fight at the start of the
fight phase, but have since become eligible.

## FIGHT

A fighting unit first piles in, then its models make melee attacks,
then the unit consolidates.

#### 1.PILE IN

Move each model in the unit that is not already in base-to-base
contact with an enemy model up to 3". A unit must be able
to end these moves within engagement range of one or more
enemy units and in unit coherency. If these conditions cannot be
met, no models in the unit can make pile-in moves this phase.

Each model making a pile-in move must end that move closer to
the closest enemy model. A model already touching an enemy
model cannot move, but still counts as having piled in.

#### 2. MAKE MELEE ATTACKS

#### WHICH MODELS FIGHT: Only models in the attacking unit that are

either within engagement range of an enemy unit, or in base-to-
base contact with another model from their own unit that is in
base-to-base contact with an enemy unit, can fight.

#### SELECT WEAPON: A model fights with an equipped melee weapon.

If it has more than one, declare which one it is using before
resolving its attacks. If that weapon has more than 1 profile,
declare which profile it is using before resolving its attacks.
A model makes a number of melee attacks equal to the
ATTACKS of the melee weapon it is using.

#### SELECT TARGETS: Select the targeted enemy units. The attacking

model must either be within engagement range of an enemy
unit, or in base-to-base contact with another model from their
own unit that is in base-to-base contact with an enemy unit.

If the model’s melee weapon can make more than 1 attack,
it can make them all against the same target, or split them
between different targets. If a unit has more than 1 model, each
can make their attacks at the same or different targets. Declare
which attacks are targeting which units before any are resolved.

If there are no eligible targets, that unit cannot make melee
attacks this phase, but can still consolidate.

#### MAKE ATTACKS: Melee attacks are resolved in the same way as

ranged attacks, and you make 1 hit roll for each attack. If more
than 1 enemy unit has been targeted, resolve all of the attacks
against 1 target before moving on to the next.

If a model is attacking with more than 1 melee weapon, and they
have different profiles, then after you have resolved an attack
with one of those weapons, if any other weapons with the same
profile are also being used, you must resolve those attacks
before resolving any other attacks against the target.

Resolve all of the attacks you declared targets for, even if no
models in the target unit remain within engagement range.

#### 3. CONSOLIDATE

After a unit has finished making its melee attacks, it
consolidates. You can move each model in the unit that is not in
base-to-base contact with an enemy model up to 3". Each model
must finish its consolidation move within engagement range of
one or more enemy units and in unit coherency.

If these conditions cannot be met, then each model in the unit
can instead make a consolidation move towards the closest
objective marker, but only if they end up within range of that
marker and in unit coherency. If these conditions can also not be
met, no models in the unit can make consolidation moves this
phase and that unit’s fight ends.

```
If a unit can end its consolidation within engagement range
of enemy units, then each time one of its models makes a
consolidation move, it must end that move closer to the closest
enemy model. If it can also end that move in base-to-base
contact with one or more enemy models while still satisfying the
conditions above, it must do so. The controlling player chooses
the order in which to move their models.
```
## ATTACKS

## 1. HIT ROLL

```
Roll D6 for each attack. If the result equals or exceeds the
attack’s BALLISTIC SKILL (BS) if using a ranged weapon, or
WEAPON SKILL (WS) if using a melee weapon, the hit roll is
successful and scores 1 hit against the target unit. Otherwise the
attack fails and the attack sequence ends.
```
```
An unmodified 6 is a critical hit and is always successful, and
an unmodified 1 always fails. A hit roll can never be modified by
more than -1 or +1.
```
## 2. WOUND ROLL

```
Each time an attack scores a hit against a target unit, make a
wound roll. Roll D6 and compare the attack’s STRENGTH (S) with
the target’s TOUGHNESS (T):
```
```
STRENGTH VS TOUGHNESS D6 RESULT REQUIRED
S twice (or more) than T 2+
S greater than T 3+
S equal to T 4+
S lower than T 5+
S half (or less) than T 6+
```
```
If the result equals or exceeds the required number, the wound
roll is successful and scores 1 wound against the target unit.
Otherwise the attack fails and the attack sequence ends.
An unmodified 6 is a critical wound and is always successful, and
an unmodified 1 always fails. A wound roll can never be modified
by more than -1 or +1.
```
## 3. ALLOCATE ATTACK

```
If an attack successfully wounds the target unit, the player
controlling that unit allocates that attack to 1 model in the unit.
```
```
If a model in the target unit has already lost any wounds or has
already had attacks allocated to it this phase, that attack must
be allocated to that model. Otherwise, it may be allocated to any
model in the target unit. It does not matter if that model is visible
to or within range/engagement range of the attacking model.
```
## 4. SAVING THROW

```
The player controlling the target unit then makes 1 saving throw.
```
#### Roll D6 and modify the result by the ARMOUR PENETRATION

```
(AP) of the attack.
```
```
If the result equals or exceeds the SAVE (SV) of the model the
attack was allocated to, the saving throw is successful and the
attack sequence ends. Otherwise, that saving throw fails and
that model suffers damage.
```
```
An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails. A saving throw can
never be improved by more than +1.
```
#### INVULNERABLE SAVES: When an attack is allocated to a model

```
with an invulnerable save, the controlling player must choose to
use that model’s SAVE or its invulnerable save, but not both. If it
has more than 1 invulnerable save, it can only use one of them.
Invulnerable saving throws are never modified by an attack’s AP.
```
#### BENEFIT OF COVER: Each time a ranged attack is allocated to a

```
model that has the benefit of cover, add 1 to the saving throw
made for that attack (excluding invulnerable saving throws).
Models with a SV of 3+ or better cannot have the benefit of cover
against attacks with an AP of 0. Multiple instances of the benefit
```
#### of cover are not cumulative.

## 5. INFLICT DAMAGE

```
The damage inflicted is equal to the DAMAGE (D) of the attack.
A model loses 1 wound for each point of damage it suffers. If
a model’s wounds are reduced to 0 or less, it is destroyed and
removed from play. Excess damage is lost and has no effect.
```
#### FEEL NO PAIN X+: Each time a model with this ability suffers

```
damage and so would lose a wound (including wounds lost due
to mortal wounds), roll D6: if the result equals or exceeds x, that
wound is ignored and is not lost. You can only use 1 copy of this
ability each time that model would lose a wound.
```
#### DEADLY DEMISE X+: When a model with this ability is destroyed,

```
roll D6 before removing it from play. On a 6, each unit within 6"
suffers a number of mortal wounds equal to x (if this is a random
number, roll separately for each unit within 6").
```
#### MORTAL WOUNDS

```
Each mortal wound inflicts 1 point of damage on the target unit,
always applied one at a time. Do not make a wound roll or saving
throw (including invulnerable saves) against a mortal wound.
Excess damage from mortal wounds is not lost if the damage can
be allocated to another model. Instead, keep allocating damage
to another model in the target unit until either all the damage
has been allocated or the target unit is destroyed.
If an attack inflicts mortal wounds in addition to normal damage,
resolve the normal damage first. If the normal damage is saved,
the target unit still suffers the mortal wounds.
```
#### IGNORING WOUNDS: If a model can ignore wounds and has

```
multiple such rules, you can only use 1 each time the model
loses a wound (including wounds lost due to mortal wounds).
```
## LEADERSHIP TESTS

```
To take a leadership test, roll 2D6: if the total equals or exceeds
the best LD in the unit, the test is passed. Otherwise, it is failed.
```
## OTHER ABILITIES

```
Aura abilities affect multiple models or units in range. A model
with an aura ability is always within range of its own aura ability.
A unit can be affected by more than 1 aura ability at a time, but
if it is within range of the same aura ability more than once, that
ability only applies to that unit once.
```
#### Psychic weapons and abilities that can only be used by PSYKERS.

```
If a psychic weapon or ability causes any unit to suffer wounds,
each of those wounds has been inflicted by a psychic attack.
```
## TRANSPORTS

#### TRANSPORT models have a transport capacity that determines

```
the type and maximum number of friendly models that can
embark within them (they can start the battle embarked).
```
#### EMBARK

```
If a unit makes a normal, advance, or fall back move, and
every model in that unit ends that move within 3" of a friendly
```
#### TRANSPORT , they can embark within it. A unit cannot embark if it

#### has already disembarked from a TRANSPORT in the same phase.

```
Remove the unit from the battlefield. Units cannot normally do
anything or be affected in any way while they are embarked.
```
#### DISEMBARK

```
A unit that starts its movement phase embarked within a
```
#### TRANSPORT can disembark in that phase. Set up the unit wholly

#### within 3" of the TRANSPORT and not within engagement range of

```
enemy models. If it cannot be set up, it cannot disembark. It can
```
#### then act normally the rest of the turn as long as the TRANSPORT

```
remained stationary, or has not yet made a normal, advance, or
fall back move this phase. It cannot choose to remain stationary.
```
#### Units that disembark from a TRANSPORT that made a normal

```
move this phase count as having made a normal move. They
can otherwise act normally in the rest of the turn. Units cannot
```
#### disembark from a TRANSPORT that advanced or fell back this turn.

#### DESTROYED TRANSPORTS

#### If a TRANSPORT is destroyed, any units embarked within it must

#### immediately disembark before the TRANSPORT is removed from

#### the battlefield. Those units are not affected by the TRANSPORT’S

```
Deadly Demise ability; instead roll D6 for each disembarking
model, and on a roll of 1 that model suffers 1 mortal wound.
```
#### If a model disembarks from a destroyed TRANSPORT , until the

```
start of its controlling player’s next command phase, that unit is
battle-shocked. Also, until the end of the turn, that unit counts
as having made a normal move, and cannot declare a charge.
```
#### If a TRANSPORT is destroyed and you cannot set up a disembarking

```
unit wholly within 3" of it and not within engagement range of
enemy models, that unit performs an emergency disembarkation.
```
#### Disembark as you would from a destroyed TRANSPORT , but set

```
up wholly within 6" and not within engagement range of enemy
models. When rolling for each model, it suffers 1 mortal wound on
a roll of 1-3 instead of 1. If it still cannot be set up, it is destroyed.
```
## AIRCRAFT

#### When you are instructed to Declare Battle Formations, AIRCRAFT

```
must start the battle in reserves instead of being set up on the
battlefield. Once the battle has started, they are then treated as
strategic reserves units. Only units that are themselves placed
```
#### into reserves can start the battle embarked within AIRCRAFT

#### TRANSPORT models that are in reserves.

#### AIRCRAFT IN THE MOVEMENT PHASE

#### AIRCRAFT cannot advance, fall back or remain stationary. When

```
they are selected to move, they can still make a normal move if
enemy units are within engagement range of them.
```
#### Each time an AIRCRAFT makes a normal move, first move the

```
model straight forward a minimum of 20" (all parts of the
model’s base must end the move at least this far from where
they started). Then it can pivot on the spot up to 90°(this does
not contribute to how far the model moves). If any part of the
model’s base crosses the edge of the battlefield, or it cannot
move a minimum of 20", its move ends and it is placed into
strategic reserves. There is no upper limit to how far aircraft
models can move.
If placed into strategic reserves, an aircraft model always arrives
from strategic reserves in your next turn.
When a unit is selected to move in the movement phase, if the
```
#### only enemy models within engagement range are AIRCRAFT , then

```
that unit can still make a normal or advance move.
Whenever a model makes any kind of move, it can be moved
```
#### over enemy AIRCRAFT as if they were not there, and can be

#### moved within engagement range of enemy AIRCRAFT , but

```
it cannot end that move on top of another model or within
```
#### engagement range of any enemy AIRCRAFT.

#### HOVER: When you are instructed to Declare Battle Formations,

```
you must first declare which models from your army with this
ability will be in hover mode. The M of a model in hover mode
```
#### is changed to 20", and it loses the AIRCRAFT keyword and all

```
associated rules. Models in hover mode do not start the battle
in reserves, but you can choose to place them into strategic
reserves as normal if you wish.
```
#### AIRCRAFT IN THE CHARGE AND FIGHT PHASES

#### AIRCRAFT cannot declare a charge, and only units that can F LY

#### can select an AIRCRAFT unit as a target of their charge. Such

```
units can end their charge move within engagement range of one
```
#### or more enemy AIRCRAFT.

#### An AIRCRAFT model is only eligible to fight if it is within

#### engagement range of one or more enemy units that can F LY , and

#### it can only make melee attacks against units that can F LY. Only

#### models that can F LY can make melee attacks against AIRCRAFT.

#### AIRCRAFT cannot make pile-in or consolidation moves. Each time

#### a model makes such a move, unless it can F LY , AIRCRAFT models

```
are ignored when moving closer to the closest enemy model.
```

## STRATEGIC RESERVES

Strategic reserves are units that players have chosen to keep
off the battlefield until they require them. They are technically
reserves units, but the reverse is not true.

Before the battle, when you Declare Battle Formations, you
can select one or more units from your army to be placed into
strategic reserves. The combined points value of these units

#### (including those embarked within TRANSPORT models that are

themselves placed into strategic reserves) cannot exceed 25%
of your total points limit. So for an incursion game, a maximum
of 250 points, for a strike force game, 500 points, and for an
onslaught game, 750 points.

Strategic reserve units can arrive later in the battle during the
reinforcements step of any of your movement phases except
during the first battle round.

Any strategic reserve units that are not on the battlefield at the
end of the battle count as destroyed.

They are set up when they arrive as follows:

- During the second battle round, arriving SR units must be set
    up wholly within 6" of any battlefield edge, but none of their
    models can be set up within the enemy deployment zone.
- Starting from the third battle round, arriving SR units must be
    set up wholly within 6" of any battlefield edge.

In any case, SR units cannot be set up within 9" horizontally of
any enemy models. Apply all other rules for setting up reserves.

## OBJECTIVES

If a mission specifies the placement of objective markers, use
round 40mm diameter markers, and place them so they are
centred on the point specified by the mission. When measuring
distances to and from objective markers, measure to and from
the closest part of that marker. Models can move over them as if
they were not there, but they cannot end a move on top of one.

A model is in range of an objective marker if it is within 3"
horizontally and 5" vertically of that marker.

To determine a player’s level of control over an objective marker,
add together the OC of all the models from that player’s army
that are within range of it. A player controls an objective marker
at the end of any phase if their level of control over it is greater
than their opponent’s. If both players have the same level, that
objective marker is contested.

## TERRAIN FEATURES

#### CRATERS AND RUBBLE

#### Keywords: AREA TERRAIN, CRATER

Movement: Normal.

Visibility: Normal.

#### Benefit of cover: INFANTRY models wholly on top of this terrain.

#### BARRICADES AND FUEL PIPES

#### Keywords: OBSTACLE, BARRICADE

Movement: Models can move up, over and down this terrain, but
cannot be set up or end any kind of move on top of it.

Visibility: Normal.

Engagement range: In the charge phase, if an enemy unit is
within 1" of this terrain, a charging unit on the opposite side of
this terrain can still make a charge move against that enemy unit
provided it ends that charge move as close as possible to this
terrain and within 2" of that enemy unit. In the Fight phase, units
are eligible to fight, and models can make attacks, if their target
is on the opposite side of this terrain and within 2" of them.

#### Benefit of cover: INFANTRY models wholly within 3" of this

terrain, and if the models are not fully visible to every model in
the attacking unit because of this terrain.

#### BATTLEFIELD DEBRIS AND STATUARY

#### Keywords: OBSTACLE, BATTLEFIELD DEBRIS

```
Movement: Models can move up, over and down this terrain, but
cannot be set up or end any kind of move on top of it.
Visibility: Normal.
Benefit of cover: If the model is not fully visible to every model in
the attacking unit because of this terrain.
```
#### HILLS, INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES, SEALED BUILDINGS

#### AND ARMOURED CONTAINERS

#### Keywords: HILL

```
Movement: These are raised areas that models can be set up on
top of or end a move on top of, provided the model’s base does
not overhang the terrain (if the model does not have a base, no
part of it that would be in contact with the battlefield at ground
level can overhang). Other terrain features can be set up on top
```
#### of HILLS , provided no part of them overhang that terrain.

```
Visibility: Normal.
Benefit of cover: If the model is not fully visible to every model in
the attacking unit because of this terrain.
```
#### WOODS

#### Keywords: AREA TERRAIN, WOODS

```
Footprint: When this terrain is set up, both players must agree
upon its footprint (its boundary at ground level). If this terrain is
mounted on a base, that defines its footprint.
Movement: Normal.
Visibility: Models and units wholly within this terrain are never
fully visible to an observing model. If a model not wholly within
this terrain must look through or over this terrain to draw LOS
to another model, then that other model is never considered
to be fully visible to that observer, and so it has the benefit of
```
#### cover from this terrain. AIRCRAFT and TOWERING models are

```
exceptions (visibility to and from such models is as normal,
even if this terrain is wholly in between them and the observer).
Models wholly within this terrain can see out of it normally.
Benefit of cover: If the model is either wholly within this terrain,
or it is not fully visible to every model in the attacking unit
because of this terrain.
```
#### RUINS

#### Keywords: AREA TERRAIN, RUINS

```
Footprint: When this terrain is set up, both players must agree
upon its footprint (its boundary at ground level). If this terrain is
mounted on a base, that defines its footprint.
Plunging fire: Each time a model wholly within this terrain makes
a ranged attack, if it is 6" or more vertically from ground level,
and every model in the target unit is at ground level, improve the
AP of that attack by 1.
```
#### Movement: INFANTRY and BEAST models can move through this

```
terrain as if it were not there. A model cannot end a move within
```
#### a wall or floor or similar. INFANTRY , BEAST and F LY models can be

```
set up or end a move on any floor level, but if that level is not the
ground floor, they can only do so if their base does not overhang
the floor at that level (if a model does not have a base, no part
of that model that would be in contact with the battlefield at
ground level can overhang that floor]. All other models can only
be set up or end a move on the ground floor of this terrain.
Visibility: Models cannot see over or through this terrain feature
```
#### (even through open windows, doors, etc.). AIRCRAFT and

#### TOWERING models are exceptions (visibility to and from such

```
models is as normal, even if this terrain is wholly in between
them and the observing model). Models can see into this terrain
feature normally, and models that are wholly within this terrain
feature can see out of it normally.
Benefit of cover: If the model is either wholly within this terrain,
or it is not fully visible to every model in the attacking unit
because of this terrain.
```
## MUSTERING AN ARMY

#### 1. SELECT BATTLE SIZE: With your opponent, select a battle sizes.

```
This determines the total number of points each player can
spend to build their army and how long the battle will last.
```
#### INCURSION: 1000 points per army. Up to 2 hours duration.

#### STRIKE FORCE: 2000 points per army. Up to 3 hours duration.

#### ONSLAUGHT: 3000 points per army. Up to 4 hours duration.

#### 2. START YOUR ARMY ROSTER: Record the details of your army on

```
an army roster. Players must show this to their opponent before
battle commences.
```
#### 3. SELECT ARMY FACTION: Select 1 army faction keyword.

#### 4. SELECT DETACHMENT RULES: Note on your army roster 1 set of

```
detachment rules for your army. Some of these list units that you
must include or cannot include in your army.
```

#### army. Your army must include at least 1 CHARACTER unit. Each

```
time you include a unit in your army, it can take any upgrade,
enhancement, or options it has access to.
Note on your army roster the number of models in the unit, any
weapons, wargear, upgrades and any enhancement it has, and
its points value. You can only include a unit in your army if:
```
- That unit has the faction keyword you chose for your army.
- You have enough points remaining.
- Your army does not already contain 3 units with the
    same datasheet name as that unit; or 6 units with the

#### same datasheet name as that unit if it is a BATTLELINE or

#### DEDICATED TRANSPORT unit. Every DEDICATED TRANSPORT

```
unit from your army must start the battle with at least 1 unit
embarked within it, or it cannot be deployed for that battle
and will instead count as having been destroyed during the
first battle round.
```
#### Only CHARACTER can be given enhancements and your army

```
cannot include more than 3 enhancements in total. No unit
can have more than 1 enhancement and each enhancement
included in your army must be unique.
```
#### EPIC HEROES cannot be given any enhancements. Your army

#### cannot include the same EPIC HERO more than once.

#### 6. SELECT WARLORD: Select 1 CHARACTER model from your army

```
to be your warlord (the leader of your army) and note this on
```
#### your army roster. Your warlord gains the WARLORD keyword.

## MISSIONS

```
Choose a mission, or roll off, and the winner decides.
```
#### 1. MUSTER ARMIES: Players muster their armies based on their

```
selected battle size. The mission may include further rules and
guidelines.

```
the battlefield and how to set up any terrain features or objective
makers. Otherwise, use the normal guidelines.
```
#### 4. DETERMINE ATTACKER AND DEFENDER: Players roll off and the

```
winner is the attacker; their opponent is the defender.
```
#### 5. DECLARE BATTLE FORMATIONS: Both players secretly note:

- Which of their Leader units start the battle attached (specify
    which Leader unit is attached to which Bodyguard unit).
- Which of their units start the battle embarked within

#### TRANSPORT models (specify which units are embarked on

```
which models).
```
- Which of their units will start the battle in reserves (including
    strategic reserves).

```
Declare your selections to your opponent.
```
#### 6. DEPLOY ARMIES: The mission’s deployment map shows where

```
each player can set up (their deployment zone).
```
#### 7. DETERMINE FIRST TURN: The mission describes how to

```
determine who has the first turn.
```
#### 8. RESOLVE PRE-BATTLE RULES: Players alternate resolving any

```
pre-battle rules units their units have, starting with the player
taking the first turn.
```
#### 9. BEGIN THE BATTLE: Begin the first battle round. Continue

has achieved a certain victory condition.
```
#### 11. DETERMINE VICTOR: The mission describes its victory

```
conditions. If neither player achieves a victory, the game is a
draw.
```
## COMBAT PATROL MISSIONS

#### 1. SELECT COMBAT PATROL AND ENHANCEMENT: Players

```
select and declare their combat patrols. Choose 1 of the 2
```
#### enhancements (typically for your WARLORD ).

#### 2. DETERMINE MISSION: Choose or roll for a combat patrol mission.

#### 3. CREATE THE BATTLEFIELD: Set up terrain features and

```
objective markers on a battlezone 44"x30".
```
#### 4. DETERMINE ATTACKER AND DEFENDER: Players agree which

```
battlefield edge is the attacker’s and which is the defender’s.
They then roll off and the winner decides who is the attacker and
who is the defender.
```
#### 5. DECLARE BATTLE FORMATIONS: Both players secretly note:

- Which of their units form patrol squads. If a unit has this
    ability, it can be split into 2 or more smaller units.
- Which of their Leader units start the battle attached (specify
    which Leader unit is attached to which Bodyguard unit).
- Which of their units start the battle embarked within

#### TRANSPORT models (specify which units are embarked on

```
which models).
```
- Which of their units will start the battle in reserves (usually
    those with the Deep Strike ability).
Declare your selections to your opponent.

#### 6. DEPLOY ARMIES: Players alternate setting up their remaining

```
units one at a time, starting with the defender. Your models must
be set up wholly within your deployment zone.
```

other player may continue their turns until the battle ends.
```
#### 11. DETERMINE VICTOR: The player with the most VPs is the

```
winner (on a tie, the battle is a draw).
```
#### SECURING OBJECTIVE MARKERS

```
At the end of each command phase, if the player whose turn it
```
#### is controls an objective marker and any BATTLELINE units from

```
their army (excluding battle-shocked ones) are within range of it,
that marker is secured by that player.
```
```
While an objective marker is secured by a player, it remains
under their control, even if they have no models within range of
it. It stops being so if their opponent controls it at the end of any
subsequent command phase.
```

## WEAPON ABILITIES

#### ANTI Each time an anti weapon attacks a target with the

keyword after the word ‘anti-’, an unmodified wound roll of
X+ scores a critical wound.

#### ASSAULT If a unit that advanced this turn is equipped with

any assault weapons, it may still shoot in the shooting phase,
but only with its assault weapons.

#### BLAST Each time you determine how many attacks are made

with a blast weapon, add 1 to the result for every 5 models
that were in the target unit when you selected it as the target
(round down). Blast weapons can never be used to make
attacks against a unit within engagement range of units from
your own army (including its own unit).

#### DEVASTATING WOUNDS Each time a devastating wounds

weapon attacks, a critical wound inflicts a number of mortal
wounds on the target equal to the weapon’s DAMAGE, and
the attack sequence ends.

#### EXTRA ATTACKS Each time the bearer of an extra attacks

weapon fights, it can make attacks with that weapon in
addition to the one it chooses to fight with. The number
of attacks made with an extra attacks weapon cannot be
modified by other rules.

#### HAZARDOUS Each time a unit is selected to shoot or fight, if

any models attack with hazardous weapons, then after that
unit has resolved all its attacks, take 1 hazardous test for
each hazardous weapon used.

Roll D6: on a 1 that test is failed and 1 model in the unit
equipped with a hazardous weapon (selected by the
controlling player) is destroyed.

If that model is a CHARACTER, MONSTER, or VEHICLE, it
suffers 3 mortal wounds instead. If you selected a character
model in an attached unit, the mortal wounds must be
allocated to that model first.

#### HEAVY Each time a heavy weapon attacks, if the attacking

model’s unit remained stationary this turn, add 1 to the hit
roll.

#### IGNORES COVER Each time an ignores cover weapon attacks,

the target cannot gain the benefit of cover against that
attack.

#### INDIRECT FIRE Attacks can be made with indirect fire

weapons even if the target is not visible. If no models are
visible when you select a target unit, then each time a model
in the attacking unit makes an attack against that target
using an indirect fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s
hit roll and the target has the benefit of cover against that
attack.

#### LANCE Each time a lance weapon attacks, if the bearer made

a charge move this turn, add 1 to that attack’s wound roll.

#### LETHAL HITS Each time a lethal hit weapon attacks, a critical

hit automatically wounds the target.

#### MELTA Each time a melta weapon attack targets a unit within

half that weapon’s range, increase that attack’s DAMAGE
by X.

#### PISTOL If a unit contains any models equipped with pistols,

it may shoot in its shooting phase even while it is within
engagement range of enemy units.

When it shoots, you can only resolve attacks using its pistols,
and can only target one of the units in engagement range
(even if other friendly units are within engagement range of
that enemy unit).

```
A model equipped with a pistol (unless it is a MONSTER or
a VEHICLE) can either shoot with its pistols or with all of
its other ranged weapons. Declare which before selecting
targets.
```
#### PRECISION Each time an attack made with a precision

```
weapon successfully wounds an attached unit, if a
CHARACTER model in that unit is visible to the attacking
model, the attacker can choose to have that attack allocated
to that character instead of following the normal attack
sequence.
```
#### RAPID FIRE Each time a rapid fire weapon targets a unit

```
within half that weapon’s range, increase its ATTACKS by X.
```
#### SUSTAINED HITS Each time a sustained hits weapon attacks,

```
if a critical hit is rolled, that attack scores additional hits
equal to X.
```
#### TORRENT Each time a torrent weapon attacks, that attack

```
automatically hits the target.
```
#### TWIN-LINKED Each time a twin-linked weapon attacks, you

```
can re-roll that WOUND roll.
```
## DEPLOYMENT ABILITIES

#### DEEP STRIKE During the Declare Battle Formations step of

```
mission setup, if every model in a unit has this ability, you can
set it up in reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield.
```
```
lf you do, in the reinforcements step of one of your movement
phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield
that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models.
```
#### INFILTRATORS During deployment, if every model in a unit

```
has this ability, you can set it up anywhere on the battlefield
more than 9” horizontally away from the enemy deployment
zone and all enemy models.
```
#### LEADER CHARACTER units with this ability are leaders, and

```
the units they can lead are their bodyguard.
```
```
During the Declare Battle Formations step of mission setup,
for each leader in your army, if your army also includes any
of their bodyguard units, you can select one. The leader then
attaches to that unit for the battle and is said to be leading it.
Each bodyguard unit can only have 1 leader attached to it.
```
```
While a bodyguard unit contains a leader, it is an attached
unit and, with the exception of rules triggered when units are
destroyed, it is treated as a single unit.
Each time an attack targets an attached unit, until the
attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the
TOUGHNESS of the bodyguard models in that unit, even if a
leader in that unit has a different TOUGHNESS.
```
```
Each time an attack successfully wounds an attached unit,
```
#### that attack cannot be allocated to a CHARACTER model in

#### that unit, even if that CHARACTER has lost any wounds or has

```
already had attacks allocated to it this phase.
As soon as the last bodyguard model in an attached unit
has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that
```
#### have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to CHARACTER

```
models in that unit.
```
#### SCOUTS If every model in a unit has the Scouts X ability,

```
then at the start of the first battle round, before the first turn
begins, it can make a normal move of up to X" as if it were
your movement phase.
```
#### If the unit starts the battle embarked in a DEDICATED

#### TRANSPORT model, and only models with this ability are within

#### that model, that DEDICATED TRANSPORT can make this move.

```
The movement must end more than 9" horizontally away
from all enemy models. If both players have units that can
do this, the player who is taking the first turn moves their
units first.

```
Command points can be spent during the battle to use
stratagems. When you use a stratagem, reduce your CP total
by the amount listed. If you do not have enough CP for a
specific stratagem, you cannot use it. You can use the same
stratagem multiple times during a battle, but you cannot use
the same stratagem more than once in the same phase.
All players can use these core stratagems:
```
## EITHER PLAYERS TURN

#### COMMAND RE-ROLL (1 CP) CORE, BATTLE TACTIC

```
WHEN: In any phase, just after you have made a hit roll, a
wound roll, a damage roll, a saving throw, an advance roll,
a charge roll, a desperate escape test, a hazardous test, or
just after you have rolled the dice to determine the number
of attacks made with a weapon, for an attack, model or unit
from your army.
```
```
EFFECT: You re-roll that roll, test or saving throw.
```
#### COUNTER OFFENSIVE (2 CP) CORE, STRATEGIC PLOY

```
WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy unit has fought.
```
```
TARGET: One unit from your army that is within engagement
range of one or more enemy units and that has not already
been selected to fight this phase.
```
```
EFFECT: Your unit fights next.
```
#### EPIC CHALLENGE (1 CP) CORE, EPIC DEED

#### WHEN: Fight phase, when a CHARACTER unit from your army

```
that is within engagement range of one or more attached
units is selected to fight.
```
#### TARGET: One CHARACTER model in your unit.

Command points can be spent during the battle to use
stratagems. When you use a stratagem, reduce your CP total
by the amount listed. If you do not have enough CP for a
specific stratagem, you cannot use it. You can use the same
stratagem multiple times during a battle, but you cannot use
the same stratagem more than once in the same phase.

## STRATAGEMS STRATAGEMS


## THE BATTLE ROUND

## COMMAND PHASE

## 1. COMMAND

Both players gain 1 command point (CP). Beyond this, each
player can only gain 1 CP per round, regardless of the source.

## 2. BATTLE-SHOCK

Take a 2D6 battle-shock test for each of your units on the
battlefield that is below half-strength. If the result equals or
exceeds the unit’s best LEADERSHIP, the test is passed.

If failed, that unit is battle-shocked until the start of your next
command phase. While a unit is battle-shocked:

- The OBJECTIVE CONTROL of all its models is 0.
- If it falls back, you must make a desperate escape test for
    every model in that unit.
- Its controlling player cannot use stratagems to affect it.

## MOVEMENT PHASE

## 1. MOVE UNITS

Select your units in any order to make a normal move,
advance, or remain stationary.

A unit within engagement range(ER) of any enemy models
can only choose to remain stationary or fall back.

A unit must finish a move in unit coherency or it cannot move.

#### REMAIN STATIONARY: None of the unit’s models can move.

#### NORMAL MOVE: Move up to M, but not within ER.

#### ADVANCE: Move up to M plus a D6 advance roll for the unit,

but none can be moved within ER. A unit cannot shoot or
declare a charge in the same turn it advanced.

#### FALL BACK: Move up to M. Can move within ER, but cannot

end the move within ER. A unit cannot shoot or declare a
charge in the same turn that it fell back.

For each model that falls back over an enemy model, make

#### a D6 desperate escape test (unless TITANIC or F LY ) before

any models in that unit are moved. If the falling back unit
is battle-shocked, make a desperate escape test for every
model before any are moved. For each result of 1-2, 1 model
from the falling back unit is destroyed.

## 2. REINFORCEMENTS

You can set up any of your reserves units, one at a time.
They count as having made a normal move this turn.

## SHOOTING PHASE

Select your eligible units one at a time and shoot with them.
Units that advanced or fell back this turn cannot shoot.

Declare the shooters, targets, weapons, and weapon profile if
a weapon has more than one. An enemy unit can be selected
as a target if it has at least 1 model within range and visible.

A unit cannot shoot while within ER. An enemy unit within ER
of any friendly units cannot be selected as a target.

A shooting model makes a number of attacks equal to its
weapon’s ATTACKS: make 1 hit roll for each.

#### LONE OPERATIVE: Unless part of an attached unit, a LONE

#### OPERATIVE can only be targeted if the attacker is within 12".

#### STEALTH: Subtract 1 from the attack’s hit roll.

#### MONSTER/VEHICLE units may shoot even within ER, even if

```
other friendly units are also within ER of that enemy unit.
When they attack, if they are within ER range (unless a pistol
attack), subtract 1 from the hit roll. You can select an enemy
```
#### MONSTER/VEHICLE unit within ER of any your units from as a

```
target. Unless a pistol attack, subtract 1 from the hit roll.
```
## CHARGE PHASE

```
Select your eligible units one at a time to declare a charge
into close combat. The unit must be within 12" of an enemy
units, and cannot have advanced or fallen back this turn, be
```
#### within ER, or be AIRCRAFT. Select enemy unit(s) within 12" as

```
the targets of that charge (they do not need to be visible).
Make a 2D6 charge roll to find the maximum number of
inches each model in the unit can move, and must be enough
for the charging unit to end that move in unit coherency
to within ER of every unit you selected as a target without
moving within ER of any enemy units that were not selected.
If any of these conditions cannot be met, the charge fails and
no models in the charging unit move this phase.
```
```
Otherwise, move the charging models in the charging unit
the charge distance, so that each ends its move closer to
one of the target units. A model must move into base-to-base
contact with one or more enemy models if possible.
```
## FIGHT PHASE

```
Starting with the player whose turn is not taking place,
players alternate selecting one of their units within ER of an
enemy unit and/or that made a charge move this turn to fight.
```
## 1. FIGHTS FIRST

```
Eligible units with the Fights First ability fight (every model in
the unit must have this ability), including units that made a
charge move this turn and that have a charge bonus.
```
## 2. REMAINING COMBATS

```
All remaining eligible units fight, including any units with the
Fights First ability that were not eligible to fight at the start of
the fight phase, but have since become eligible.
```
## FIGHT

#### 1.PILE IN

```
Move each model in the unit that is not already in base-to-
base contact with an enemy model up to 3" to stop within
ER of enemy units and in unit coherency. If these conditions
cannot be met, no models in the unit can make pile-in moves.
Each model making a pile-in move must end that move closer
to the closest enemy model.
```
#### 2. MAKE MELEE ATTACKS

#### WHICH MODELS FIGHT: Only models in the attacking unit that

```
are either within ER of an enemy unit, or in base-to-base
contact with another model from their own unit that is in
base-to-base contact with an enemy unit, can fight.
```
#### SELECT WEAPON: Declare the melee weapon and profile being

```
used. A model makes a number of melee attacks equal to the
ATTACKS of its melee weapon.
```
#### SELECT TARGETS: Select the targeted enemy units. If there are

```
no eligible targets, that unit cannot make melee attacks this
phase, but can still consolidate.
```
#### MAKE ATTACKS: Resolve melee attacks in the same way as

```
ranged attacks.
```
#### CONSOLIDATE: A unit consolidates after its attacks. You can

```
move each model not in base-to-base contact with an enemy
model up to 3". They must finish this move within ER and in
unit coherency. If this is not possible, each model can instead
make a consolidation move towards the closest objective
marker if they end up within range of it and in unit coherency.
```
## THE BATTLE ROUND

## COMMAND PHASE

## 1. COMMAND

```
Both players gain 1 command point (CP). Beyond this, each
player can only gain 1 CP per round, regardless of the source.
```
## 2. BATTLE-SHOCK

```
Take a 2D6 battle-shock test for each of your units on the
battlefield that is below half-strength. If the result equals or
exceeds the unit’s best LEADERSHIP, the test is passed.
```
```
If failed, that unit is battle-shocked until the start of your next
command phase. While a unit is battle-shocked:
```
- The OBJECTIVE CONTROL of all its models is 0.
- If it falls back, you must make a desperate escape test for
    every model in that unit.
- Its controlling player cannot use stratagems to affect it.

#### ADVANCE: Move up to M plus a D6 advance roll for the unit,

```
but none can be moved within ER. A unit cannot shoot or
declare a charge in the same turn it advanced.
```
#### FALL BACK: Move up to M. Can move within ER, but cannot

```
end the move within ER. A unit cannot shoot or declare a
charge in the same turn that it fell back.
```
```
For each model that falls back over an enemy model, make
```
#### a D6 desperate escape test (unless TITANIC or F LY ) before

```
any models in that unit are moved. If the falling back unit
is battle-shocked, make a desperate escape test for every
model before any are moved. For each result of 1-2, 1 model
from the falling back unit is destroyed.
```
## 2. REINFORCEMENTS

```

## ATTACKS

## 1. HIT ROLL

Roll D6 for each attack. If the result equals or exceeds the
attack’s BS)if using a ranged weapon, or WS if using a melee
weapon, the hit roll scores 1 hit. Otherwise the attack fails
and the attack sequence ends.

An unmodified 6 is a critical hit, and an unmodified 1 always
fails. A hit roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.

## 2. WOUND ROLL

Each time an attack scores a hit against a target unit, make a
wound roll. Roll D6:

STRENGTH VS TOUGHNESS D6 RESULT REQUIRED

S twice (or more) than T 2+
S greater than T 3+

S equal to T 4+

S lower than T 5+
S half (or less) than T 6+

If the result equals or exceeds the required number, the
wound roll scores 1 wound. Otherwise the attack fails and the
attack sequence ends.

An unmodified 6 is a critical wound, and an unmodified 1
always fails. A wound roll can never be modified by more than
-1 or +1.

## 3. ALLOCATE ATTACK

If an attack successfully wounds the target unit, the player
controlling that unit allocates it to 1 model in the unit,
starting with models that have already lost any wounds or
have already had attacks allocated to them this phase.

## 4. SAVING THROW

The player controlling the target unit makes 1 saving throw.
Roll D6 and modify the result by the attack’s AP.

If the result equals or exceeds the SV of the model the attack
was allocated to, the attack sequence ends. Otherwise, that
model suffers damage.

An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails. A saving throw
can never be improved by more than +1.

#### INVULNERABLE SAVES: When an attack is allocated to a model

with an invulnerable save, the controlling player must choose
to use that model’s SAVE or its invulnerable save, but not
both. Invulnerable saving throws are never modified by an
attack’s AP.

#### BENEFIT OF COVER: Each time a ranged attack is allocated

to a model that has the benefit of cover, add 1 to the saving
throw made for that attack (excluding invulnerable saving
throws). Models with a SV of 3+ or better cannot have the
benefit of cover against attacks with an AP of 0.

## 5. INFLICT DAMAGE

The damage inflicted is equal to the attack’s D. A model loses
1 wound for each point of damage it suffers.

#### FEEL NO PAIN X+: When this model would lose a wound

(including mortal wounds), roll D6: if the result equals or
exceeds x, that wound is ignored.

#### DEADLY DEMISE X+: When this model is destroyed, roll D6: on

a 6, each unit within 6” suffers a number of mortal wounds
equal to x.

#### MORTAL WOUNDS

Each mortal wound inflicts 1 point of damage with no wound
roll or saving throw (including invulnerable saves). Excess
damage from mortal wounds is not lost if the damage can be
allocated to another model.

## TRANSPORTS

#### EMBARK

```
If a unit makes a normal, advance, or fall back move, and
every model in that unit ends that move within 3" of a
```
#### friendly TRANSPORT , they can embark. They cannot have

#### disembarked from a TRANSPORT in the same phase.

#### DISEMBARK

```
A unit that starts its movement phase embarked within a
```
#### TRANSPORT can disembark. Set up the unit wholly within 3"

#### of the TRANSPORT and not within ER. It can then act normally

#### the rest of the turn as long as the TRANSPORT remained

```
stationary, or has not yet made a normal, advance, or fall
back move this phase. The unit cannot remain stationary.
```
#### Units that disembark from a TRANSPORT that made a normal

```
move count as having made a normal move. Units cannot
```
#### disembark from a TRANSPORT that advanced or fell back.

#### DESTROYED TRANSPORTS

#### If a TRANSPORT is destroyed, any units within it must

```
immediately disembark. They are not affected by the
```
#### TRANSPORT’S Deadly Demise; instead roll D6 for each model,

```
and on a roll of 1 that model suffers 1 mortal wound.
```
#### If a model disembarks from a destroyed TRANSPORT , it is

```
battle-shocked until the start of its controlling player’s next
command phase. Until the end of the turn, it also counts as
having made a normal move, and cannot declare a charge.
```
#### If a TRANSPORT is destroyed and you cannot set up a

```
disembarking unit wholly within 3" of it and not within ER, it
performs an emergency disembarkation. Disembark as you
```
#### would from a destroyed TRANSPORT , but set up wholly within

```
6" and not within ER. Each model suffers 1 mortal wound on a
1-3 instead of 1. If it still cannot be set up, it is destroyed.
```
## AIRCRAFT

#### AIRCRAFT IN THE MOVEMENT PHASE

#### AIRCRAFT cannot advance, fall back or remain stationary.

```
When they are selected to move, they can still make a normal
move if enemy units are within ER.
```
```
When making a normal move, first move the model straight
forward a minimum of 20", then it can pivot up to 90°. If it
cannot move a minimum of 20", or crosses the battlefield
edge, its move ends and it is placed into strategic reserves.
If placed into strategic reserves, an aircraft model always
arrives from strategic reserves in your next turn.
```
```
When a unit is selected to move in the movement phase, if
```
#### the only enemy models within ER are AIRCRAFT , that unit can

```
still make a normal or advance move. When a model makes
```
#### any kind of move, it can be moved over enemy AIRCRAFT as

```
if they were not there, and within ER of them, but cannot end
```
#### that move on top of a model or within ER of enemy AIRCRAFT.

#### HOVER: Before the battle, declare which models with this

```
ability will be in hover mode. Their M becomes 20", and they
```
#### lose the AIRCRAFT keyword. They do not start the battle in

```
reserves, but you can place them into strategic reserves.
```
#### AIRCRAFT IN THE CHARGE AND FIGHT PHASES

#### AIRCRAFT cannot declare a charge, and only units that can

#### F LY can select an AIRCRAFT unit as a charge target. Such

#### units can end their charge within ER of enemy AIRCRAFT.

#### An AIRCRAFT model is only eligible to fight if it is within ER of

#### one or more enemy units that can F LY , and it can only make

#### melee attacks against units that can F LY. Only models that

#### can F LY can make melee attacks against AIRCRAFT.

#### AIRCRAFT cannot make pile-in or consolidation moves.

#### Each time a model makes such a move, unless it can F LY ,

#### AIRCRAFT models are ignored when moving closer to the

```
closest enemy model.
```
## ATTACKS

## 1. HIT ROLL

```
Roll D6 for each attack. If the result equals or exceeds the
attack’s BS)if using a ranged weapon, or WS if using a melee
weapon, the hit roll scores 1 hit. Otherwise the attack fails
and the attack sequence ends.
An unmodified 6 is a critical hit, and an unmodified 1 always
fails. A hit roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.
```
## 2. WOUND ROLL

```
Each time an attack scores a hit against a target unit, make a
wound roll. Roll D6:
```
```
STRENGTH VS TOUGHNESS D6 RESULT REQUIRED
S twice (or more) than T 2+
S greater than T 3+
S equal to T 4+
S lower than T 5+
S half (or less) than T 6+
```
```
If the result equals or exceeds the required number, the
wound roll scores 1 wound. Otherwise the attack fails and the
attack sequence ends.
An unmodified 6 is a critical wound, and an unmodified 1
always fails. A wound roll can never be modified by more than
-1 or +1.
```
## 3. ALLOCATE ATTACK

```
If an attack successfully wounds the target unit, the player
controlling that unit allocates it to 1 model in the unit,
starting with models that have already lost any wounds or
have already had attacks allocated to them this phase.
```
## 4. SAVING THROW

```
The player controlling the target unit makes 1 saving throw.
Roll D6 and modify the result by the attack’s AP.
If the result equals or exceeds the SV of the model the attack
was allocated to, the attack sequence ends. Otherwise, that
model suffers damage.
```
```
An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails. A saving throw
can never be improved by more than +1.
```
#### INVULNERABLE SAVES: When an attack is allocated to a model

```
with an invulnerable save, the controlling player must choose
to use that model’s SAVE or its invulnerable save, but not
both. Invulnerable saving throws are never modified by an
attack’s AP.
```
#### BENEFIT OF COVER: Each time a ranged attack is allocated

```
to a model that has the benefit of cover, add 1 to the saving
throw made for that attack (excluding invulnerable saving
throws). Models with a SV of 3+ or better cannot have the
benefit of cover against attacks with an AP of 0.
```
## 5. INFLICT DAMAGE

```
The damage inflicted is equal to the attack’s D. A model loses
1 wound for each point of damage it suffers.
```
#### FEEL NO PAIN X+: When this model would lose a wound

```
(including mortal wounds), roll D6: if the result equals or
exceeds x, that wound is ignored.
```
#### DEADLY DEMISE X+: When this model is destroyed, roll D6: on

```
a 6, each unit within 6” suffers a number of mortal wounds
equal to x.
```
#### MORTAL WOUNDS

```
Each mortal wound inflicts 1 point of damage with no wound
roll or saving throw (including invulnerable saves). Excess
damage from mortal wounds is not lost if the damage can be
allocated to another model.
```
## TRANSPORTS

#### EMBARK

```
If a unit makes a normal, advance, or fall back move, and
every model in that unit ends that move within 3" of a
```
#### friendly TRANSPORT , they can embark. They cannot have

#### disembarked from a TRANSPORT in the same phase.

#### DISEMBARK

```
A unit that starts its movement phase embarked within a
```
#### TRANSPORT can disembark. Set up the unit wholly within 3"

#### of the TRANSPORT and not within ER. It can then act normally

#### the rest of the turn as long as the TRANSPORT remained

```
stationary, or has not yet made a normal, advance, or fall
back move this phase. The unit cannot remain stationary.
```
#### Units that disembark from a TRANSPORT that made a normal

```
move count as having made a normal move. Units cannot
```
#### disembark from a TRANSPORT that advanced or fell back.

#### DESTROYED TRANSPORTS

#### If a TRANSPORT is destroyed, any units within it must

```
immediately disembark. They are not affected by the
```
#### TRANSPORT’S Deadly Demise; instead roll D6 for each model,

```
and on a roll of 1 that model suffers 1 mortal wound.
```
#### If a model disembarks from a destroyed TRANSPORT , it is

```
battle-shocked until the start of its controlling player’s next
command phase. Until the end of the turn, it also counts as
having made a normal move, and cannot declare a charge.
```
#### If a TRANSPORT is destroyed and you cannot set up a

```
disembarking unit wholly within 3" of it and not within ER, it
performs an emergency disembarkation. Disembark as you
```
#### would from a destroyed TRANSPORT , but set up wholly within

```
6" and not within ER. Each model suffers 1 mortal wound on a
1-3 instead of 1. If it still cannot be set up, it is destroyed.
```
## AIRCRAFT

#### AIRCRAFT IN THE MOVEMENT PHASE

#### AIRCRAFT cannot advance, fall back or remain stationary.

```
When they are selected to move, they can still make a normal
move if enemy units are within ER.
```
```
When making a normal move, first move the model straight
forward a minimum of 20", then it can pivot up to 90°. If it
cannot move a minimum of 20", or crosses the battlefield
edge, its move ends and it is placed into strategic reserves.
If placed into strategic reserves, an aircraft model always
arrives from strategic reserves in your next turn.
```
```
When a unit is selected to move in the movement phase, if
```
#### the only enemy models within ER are AIRCRAFT , that unit can

```
still make a normal or advance move. When a model makes
```
#### any kind of move, it can be moved over enemy AIRCRAFT as

```
if they were not there, and within ER of them, but cannot end
```
#### that move on top of a model or within ER of enemy AIRCRAFT.

#### HOVER: Before the battle, declare which models with this

```
ability will be in hover mode. Their M becomes 20", and they
```
#### lose the AIRCRAFT keyword. They do not start the battle in

```
reserves, but you can place them into strategic reserves.
```
#### AIRCRAFT IN THE CHARGE AND FIGHT PHASES

#### AIRCRAFT cannot declare a charge, and only units that can

#### F LY can select an AIRCRAFT unit as a charge target. Such

#### units can end their charge within ER of enemy AIRCRAFT.

#### An AIRCRAFT model is only eligible to fight if it is within ER of

#### one or more enemy units that can F LY , and it can only make

#### melee attacks against units that can F LY. Only models that

#### can F LY can make melee attacks against AIRCRAFT.

#### AIRCRAFT cannot make pile-in or consolidation moves.

#### Each time a model makes such a move, unless it can F LY ,

#### AIRCRAFT models are ignored when moving closer to the

```
closest enemy model.
