# Star Wars X-Wing - Rules

## SETUP

One player chooses the **Rebel** faction and the other
controls the **Imperial** faction (or randomly assign
factions).

All components belonging to your own faction are
_friendly_ , and all those belonging to your opponent’s
faction are _enemies_.

Each player builds their squads up to an agreed-
upon number of squad points. Choose **Ship** and
**Upgrade cards** from your faction. Take the ships,
stands and tokens and assemble your ships.

Choose a play area with at least 3' x 3' of space
and sit opposite one other. The side closest to you
is your edge. Place each ship in the play area in
order of lowest to highest **pilot skill**. On a tie, the
player with **initiative** places his ships with that pilot
skill first.

To place a ship, lay the range ruler straight out from
your edge and place the ship anywhere entirely
within the Range 1 section and facing any direction.
A large ship’s base may extend outside of the setup
area as long as it has filled the length of that area.

Take the cards matching your forces and place them
faceup outside the play area in view of all players.

Place **shield tokens** on each Ship card equal to its
**shield value**. A ship cannot have more than this
value.

Shuffle the **Damage deck** and place it facedown
outside the play area.

## THE GAME ROUND

## 1. PLANNING PHASE

**Each player secretly chooses a maneuver for each
of his ships** by using its maneuver dial, placing
it facedown near that ship. Maneuvers may be
assigned in any order. You may look at your own
facedown dials at any time, but not your opponent’s.

Estimate your movement—you cannot use maneuver
templates to ‘test’ where ships will end up.

```
Each maneuver consists of the bearing ( Straight,
Bank, Turn or Koiogran Turn ), the speed (between
1 and 5), and the difficulty (arrow color: a standard
maneuver is white, a simple maneuver is green and
a difficult maneuver is red).
```
## 2. ACTIVATION PHASE

```
In ascending order of pilot skill, reveal each ship’s
maneuver dial, and execute the maneuver. Then
each ship may perform 1 action.
```
```
The ship currently resolving a phase is the active
ship. Continue activating ships in order until each
ship has activated.
```
**1. Reveal Dial:** Flip the active ship’s **maneuver**
    **dial** faceup.
**2. Execute Maneuver
a. Move Ship** Slide the **maneuver template** that
    matches the chosen maneuver between the
    front guides of the ship’s base and against the
    base. Move the ship to the opposite end of the
    template, sliding its rear guides into the opposite
    end of the template. Move any tokens assigned to
    the ship along with it.

```
The Koiogran turn maneuver uses the straight
maneuver template. After executing the maneuver,
rotate the ship 180º.
```
```
b. Check Pilot Stress If the ship just executed
a red maneuver, place 1 stress token near it. If
it was a green maneuver, remove 1 stress token
from the ship (if any).
c. Clean Up Return the used template to the pile
of maneuver templates. Place the revealed dial
near the ship’s Ship card.
```
**3. Perform Action:** The ship _may_ perform 1 **action**.

```
Actions Immediately after moving, a ship may
perform 1 action shown in the action bar of its Ship
card. Pilot abilities, Upgrade cards, Damage cards,
or missions may allow other actions.
```
```
A free action does not count as the one action
allowed during the Perform Action step.
```
```
Stress A ship with at least 1 stress token cannot
execute red maneuvers or perform any actions (even
free actions).
```
```
If a ship already has a stress token and it reveals
a red maneuver, the opposing player chooses any
non-red maneuver on that ship’s dial for the ship
to execute.
```
## 3. COMBAT PHASE

```
In descending order of pilot skill, each ship can
attack 1 enemy ship inside its firing arc and in range.
```
## 1. Declare Target

```
The attacker (the active ship) must declare one
of his weapons to attack with and its target (the
defender ). The target ship must be inside the
attacker’s firing arc and within range. Measure to
verify that these conditions are met before declaring
a target.
A ship cannot target a ship if their bases are
touching.
```
```
Firing Arc
At the front of each ship token is a wedge (green for
Imperials, red for Rebels) showing the angle from
which the ship’s weapons can fire. If any part of an
enemy ship’s base falls inside the angle defined by
the active ship’s wedge it is within its firing arc.
Other ships do not obstruct firing arcs. A ship with
multiple enemy ships inside its firing arc can target
any one of them.
```
```
Range
Measure range with the range ruler : range 1 (close),
range 2 (medium), or range 3 (long). Each ship’s
primary weapon can target ships at range 1–3.
Place the range 1 end of the range ruler touching
the closest part of the attacker’s base, and point it
toward the closest part of the target ship’s base that
is inside the attacker’s firing arc. The lowest section
(1, 2, or 3) of the ruler that overlaps the target
ship’s base is the range between the ships. Range is
always measured as the shortest distance between
the two ships’ bases.
If the ruler is not long enough to reach the target,
the ship is out of range and cannot be targeted.
Range combat bonuses only occur when a ship is
attacking with its primary weapon.
```
## 2. Roll Attack Dice

```
The attacker rolls a number of attack dice equal to
the ship’s primary weapon value.
```
```
You may choose to use a secondary weapon Upgrade
card that your ship has equipped instead.
```
```
Resolve any card abilities that allow you to roll
additional (or fewer) dice. If you are targeting a
ship at Range 1 with your primary weapon, roll 1
additional attack die.
```
## 3. Modify Attack Dice

```
Resolve abilities and spend tokens that allow you
to modify (add, change and reroll) attack dice.
```
```
A player resolving multiple modifying abilities does
so in the order of his choice. If the attacker and
defender both have modifying abilities, the defender
resolves all of his abilities before the attacker.
```
```
Spending Target Lock Tokens If the attacker has
a target lock on the defender, he may discard the
assigned pair of tokens to choose any number of
attack dice and reroll them once.
```
```
Spending a Focus Token If the attacker has a focus
token, he may discard it to change all results on
the attack dice to results.
```
## 4. Roll Defense Dice

```
The defender rolls a number of defense dice equal
to the ship’s agility value.
```
```
The defender resolves any card abilities that
allow him to roll additional (or fewer) dice. If he
is targeted at Range 3 by the attacker’s primary
weapon, he rolls 1 additional defense die.
```
```
If the edge of the range ruler between the ships
overlapped an obstacle token , the attack is obstructed
and the defender rolls 1 additional defense die.
```
## 5. Modify Defense Dice

```
Resolve abilities and spend tokens that allow you to
modify (add, change and reroll) defense dice.
A player resolving multiple modifying abilities does
so in the order of his choice. If the attacker and
defender both have modifying abilities, the attacker
resolves all of his abilities before the defender.
```
```
Spending a Focus Token If the defender has a focus
token, he may discard it to change all results on
the defense dice to results.
```
```
Spending an Evade Token If the defender has an
evade token, he may discard it to add 1 additional
result to his defense roll.
```
## 6. Compare Results

```
For each result, cancel one or result from
the attack roll. All results must be canceled first.
If there is at least one uncanceled or result
remaining, the defender is hit. If all and
results are canceled, the attack misses; the
defender does not suffer any damage.
```

Each time a die result is canceled, physically
remove one die displaying the canceled result.
Ignore all canceled results during this attack. All
abilities that allow players to cancel dice must be
resolved at the start of this step.

## 7. Deal Damage

The hit ship suffers 1 damage for each uncanceled
, and _then_ suffers 1 critical damage for each
uncanceled.

For each damage or critical damage suffered, the
ship loses 1 **shield token**. If it has none, it receives
1 **Damage card** instead.

Continue resolving combat for ships in order of pilot
skill, from highest to lowest, until all ships have had
the opportunity to perform one attack. A player with
multiple ships with the same pilot skill may resolve
their attacks in the order of his choice. **Each ship
may attack only once per round**.

All dice modifiers are cumulative. If the attacker’s
dice is reduced to 0 or less, the attack causes no
damage. A die already rerolled cannot be rerolled
again during that attack.

## 4. END PHASE

**Remove unspent evade and focus tokens from all
ships and resolve any End Phase abilities on cards**.

## MOVEMENT

Ships can move through space occupied by other
ships. Hold the movement template above them and
estimate where the ship should end its move. Both
players must agree on its final position and facing.

Unless specified by a mission, a ship executing
a maneuver that causes any part of its base to go
outside the play area is immediately destroyed.

**Overlapping Other Ships**

If a ship executes a maneuver causing the final
position of its base to overlap another ship’s base,
move the active ship back along the top of the
template from the far end until it no longer overlaps
another ship. Keep the template centered between
both sets of guides on the ship’s base. Place the
ship so that the bases of both ships are touching.
Then skip the active ship’s _Perform Action_ step.

Ships with touching bases cannot declare each
other as a target during the Combat phase. As soon
as the bases are no longer touching, this combat
restriction no longer applies.

```
If the active ship is executing a maneuver that
causes it to overlap another ship, instead treat its
maneuver as a maneuver with the same speed
and color revealed on the dial.
```
```
If a part of a ship would touch another figure, add
or remove a peg from the base to prevent this and
continue moving as normal.
```
## DAMAGE

```
Damage is suffered one at a time following these
steps. All normal damage is suffered before any
critical damage.
```
**1. Reduce Shields:** If there are any **shield tokens**
    on the ship’s card, remove one and skip the next
    step. If there are no shield tokens, proceed.
**2. Damage Hull:** Deal 1 **Damage card** to the ship,
    _facedown_ next to the ship’s card. If the ship
    suffered critical damage, place the card _faceup_.

```
If the deck runs out, shuffle the discards to create
a new deck.
```
```
Critical Damage
Resolve the text on faceup Damage cards. The
card’s trait ( Ship or Pilot ) may be referenced by
other cards or abilities.
When a ship has critical damage, place a critical hit
token near the ship to remind you that it is affected
by an ongoing effect. If a ship removes the ongoing
effect, remove the token.
```
```
Destroying Ships
When a ship’s number of Damage cards is equal
to or greater than its hull value, the ship is
immediately destroyed (faceup and facedown
cards count toward this total).
Immediately remove the ship from the play area,
discard all of its Damage cards to a faceup discard
pile next to the Damage deck, and return all of its
tokens.
```
```
Simultaneous Attack
Ships with a pilot skill value equal to the active
ship’s pilot skill value have the opportunity to attack
before being destroyed.
```
```
If such a ship would be destroyed, it retains its
Damage cards but is not removed. It may perform
an attack as normal during the Combat phase,
although any faceup Damage cards just dealt to it
may affect this attack. After this ship has had its
opportunity to attack this round, it is immediately
destroyed.
```
## INITIATIVE

```
The player with the lowest squad point total has the
initiative. On a tie, roll an attack die: on a or
that player chooses who has initiative; on a or
blank, the other player chooses.
During the Activation phase, if multiple ships have
the same pilot skill, all of those ships belonging
to the player with initiative activate first. During
the Combat phase, if both players have ships with
the same pilot skill, all of those ships belonging to
the player with initiative resolve the phase first.
If multiple abilities resolve at the same time, the
player with initiative resolves his abilities first.
```
## WINNING THE GAME

```
The player who destroys all of his opponent’s
ships wins. If playing a mission, refer to its victory
conditions. If each player’s final ship is destroyed at
the same time, the player with initiative wins.
```
```
Rule Disputes If players cannot agree on a correct
ruling in a dispute, one player rolls 3 attack dice
and the other rolls 3 defense dice. The player with
the most results determines the correct ruling.
If this situation arises again in this game, apply this
same ruling. In case of a conflict between cards
and the rules, card text overrides the general rules.
If one card ability forbids an effect, while another
ability allows it, the effect is forbidden.
```
## SQUAD BUILDING

```
The number in the lower-right of a Ship or Upgrade
card is its squad point cost. Agree on a number of
squad points per faction, then secretly build squads
with a total cost up to that value. Simultaneously
reveal the cards and continue with the normal setup
steps. With more than 100 points each, you may
expand the size of the play area if desired.
Each player (or team) cannot field 2 or more cards
with the same unique character name (•). When
using multiple copies of the same non-unique ship
use 3 ID tokens of the same number and color: one
near the Ship card, the other two in the ship’s base.
```
```
Upgrade Cards For each icon in the upgrade bar
along the bottom of a Ship card, the ship can
equip 1 Upgrade card with the matching icon. If an
Upgrade card must be discarded, return it to the
box; it cannot be used for the rest of the game.
```
```
Modifications and Titles Any ship may equip up to 1
modification and 1 title unless the card is restricted
to a specific ship.
```
```
Secondary Weapons Ships may perform only one
attack during the Combat phase. Secondary weapon
cards show the header Attack: as a reminder that a
ship attacks with either its primary weapon or one of
its secondary weapons.
```
```
If the target ship is within the range shown and in
the attacker’s firing arc, then roll a number of attack
dice equal to this card’s attack value (instead of the
ship’s primary weapon value).
```
## OBSTACLES

```
Add obstacles to a game if both players both agree.
Increase the size of the play area if desired. During
setup, each player (starting with the Imperial player)
takes a turn placing 1 obstacle in the play area.
Obstacles cannot be placed within Range 1–2 of
any edge. After placing all obstacles, the Rebel
player chooses which edge is his; the Imperial
player’s edge is on the opposite side.
```
```
When your ship executes a maneuver in which
either the maneuver template or the ship’s base
overlaps an obstacle token, execute the maneuver
as normal, and then:
```
```
Asteroids Skip the Perform Action step, then roll 1
attack die and suffer any damage or critical damage
rolled. While overlapping an asteroid, the ship
cannot attack.
```
```
Debris Clouds After the Check Pilot Stress step the
ship receives 1 stress token. After performing an
action roll 1 attack die : on a , suffer 1 critical
damage. The ship can still perform attacks.
```
```
During combat, if the ship measures range through
an obstacle, the attack is obstructed and the
defender rolls 1 additional defense die.
```
```
If a ship moves through or overlaps more than 1
obstacle, it suffers the effects of each, starting with
the one that was closest to the ship in its starting
position and proceeding outward.
```
## MISSIONS

```
Before setup, agree on a mission and to either use
the ships and upgrades listed in the Mission Setup
section of the mission or choose ships using the
squad building rules (the missions in the rulebook
play best with 100 point squads). The missions in
the rulebook play best with a play area of 3' x 3'.
```
```
Players resolve game rounds as normal until one
player has fulfilled his objective. A player can only
win by fulfilling his faction’s objective.
```

## 4. END PHASE

```
Remove evade and focus tokens from all ships.
```

## ACTIONS

## Evade

```
Place 1 evade token near the ship. During the
Combat phase, spend it to add one result to the
defense roll.
```
## Focus

```
Place 1 focus token on the ship. During the
Combat phase, spend it to change all results
to results (when attacking) or to results
(when defending).
```
## Barrel Roll

```
Place the short end (or, if a large ship, the long
end) of the 1 maneuver template anywhere
against the left or right side of your ship’s base
(but not beyond the front or back edge). Place the
ship, facing the same direction, at the opposite
end (with no part of the template beyond the front
or back edge of the base). A ship cannot perform
a barrel roll if its base will overlap another ship or
obstacle token (you may measure first).
```
## Acquire a Target Lock

```
If the enemy ship is at Range 1, 2, or 3 , the
active ship may acquire a target lock on it. You
may measure 360° from your ship, and may
measure before committing to this action.
Place a red target lock token near the enemy ship,
and the blue target lock token that matches its
letter near the active ship.
A ship can maintain only 1 target lock, but
multiple ships can target the same ship. Target
lock tokens are usually only removed if the locking
ship acquires a target lock on a different ship or
spends the target lock during the Combat phase.
```
## Boost

```
Choose the 1 1 or 1 maneuver. This does
not count as performing a maneuver.
```
## Cloak

```
Place a Cloak token near the ship; its agility is
increased by 2 and it cannot perform attacks.
A ship may spend a cloak token to decloak just
before revealing its maneuver dial; then perform
a barrel roll using the 2 template or execute a
2 maneuver. Decloaking is not an action or a
maneuver and may be done under stress, but not
if it results in overlapping a ship or obstacle token
or the template overlaps an obstacle token.
```
## Pass A ship may choose not to perform any action.

## Other Actions A ship may resolve a card

```
ability with the Action: header.
A ship cannot perform the same action more than
once a round (not even when it is a free action).
```
## OBSTACLES

```
When you overlap an obstacle token, execute the
maneuver as normal, then:
Asteroids Skip the Perform Action step, then roll
1 attack die and suffer any damage or critical
damage rolled. The ship cannot attack.
```
```
Debris Clouds After the Check Pilot Stress step
take 1 stress token. After performing an action
roll 1 attack die : on a , suffer 1 critical
damage. The ship can still attack.
```
## BOMBS

```
Each bomb Upgrade card allows you to drop a
specific type of bomb token. A ship may only
drop one bomb per round. Slide the 1 maneuver
template between your ship’s rear guides, then the
bomb token’s guides into the template’s opposite
end. Place a bomb token dropped on a ship under
the ship’s base; it does not immediately detonate.
Proton: Deal 1 faceup Damage card to each ship
at Range 1 of the token. Then discard this token.
Proximity: The ship that moved through or
overlapped this token rolls 3 attack dice and suffers
all and rolled. Then discard this token.
Seismic: Each ship at Range 1 of the token
suffers 1 damage. Then discard this token.
```
## ION TOKENS

```
A ship with an ion token assigned to it does
not have a maneuver dial assigned to it. In the
Activation phase, move the ship as if it were
assigned a white 1 maneuver, then remove all
ion tokens from the ship.
A large ship is unaffected by a single ion token.
It suffers the effect only when it has 2 or more ion
tokens assigned to it (all ion tokens are removed
at the end of the Activation phase).
```
## SPECIAL FIRING ARCS

```
Ships with an auxiliary firing arc can only fire their
primary weapon in this extended firing arc. Ships
with a turret primary weapon can fire the weapon
in any direction.
```
## ACTIONS

## Evade

Place 1 **evade token** near the ship. During the
Combat phase, spend it to add one result to the
defense roll.

## Focus

Place 1 **focus token** on the ship. During the
Combat phase, spend it to change all results
to results (when attacking) or to results
(when defending).

## Barrel Roll

Place the short end (or, if a large ship, the long
end) of the 1 maneuver template anywhere
against the left or right side of your ship’s base
(but not beyond the front or back edge). Place the
ship, facing the same direction, at the opposite
end (with no part of the template beyond the front
or back edge of the base). A ship cannot perform
a barrel roll if its base will overlap another ship or
obstacle token (you may measure first).

## Acquire a Target Lock

If the enemy ship is at **Range 1, 2, or 3** , the
active ship may acquire a **target lock** on it. You
may measure 360° from your ship, and may
measure _before_ committing to this action.

Place a red target lock token near the enemy ship,
and the blue target lock token that matches its
letter near the active ship.

A ship can maintain only 1 target lock, but
multiple ships can target the same ship. Target
lock tokens are usually only removed if the locking
ship acquires a target lock on a different ship or
spends the target lock during the Combat phase.

## Boost

Choose the 1 1 or 1 maneuver. This does
not count as performing a maneuver.

## Cloak

Place a **Cloak token** near the ship; its agility is
increased by 2 and it cannot perform attacks.

A ship may spend a cloak token to **decloak** just
before revealing its maneuver dial; then perform
a barrel roll using the 2 template _or_ execute a
2 maneuver. Decloaking is not an action or a
maneuver and may be done under stress, but not
if it results in overlapping a ship or obstacle token
or the template overlaps an obstacle token.

## Pass A ship may choose not to perform any action.

## Other Actions A ship may resolve a card

```
ability with the Action: header.
A ship cannot perform the same action more than
once a round (not even when it is a free action).
```
## OBSTACLES

```
When you overlap an obstacle token, execute the
maneuver as normal, then:
Asteroids Skip the Perform Action step, then roll
1 attack die and suffer any damage or critical
damage rolled. The ship cannot attack.
```
```
Debris Clouds After the Check Pilot Stress step
take 1 stress token. After performing an action
roll 1 attack die : on a , suffer 1 critical
damage. The ship can still attack.
```
## BOMBS

```
Each bomb Upgrade card allows you to drop a
specific type of bomb token. A ship may only
drop one bomb per round. Slide the 1 maneuver
template between your ship’s rear guides, then the
bomb token’s guides into the template’s opposite
end. Place a bomb token dropped on a ship under
the ship’s base; it does not immediately detonate.
Proton: Deal 1 faceup Damage card to each ship
at Range 1 of the token. Then discard this token.
Proximity: The ship that moved through or
overlapped this token rolls 3 attack dice and suffers
all and rolled. Then discard this token.
Seismic: Each ship at Range 1 of the token
suffers 1 damage. Then discard this token.
```
## ION TOKENS

```
A ship with an ion token assigned to it does
not have a maneuver dial assigned to it. In the
Activation phase, move the ship as if it were
assigned a white 1 maneuver, then remove all
ion tokens from the ship.
A large ship is unaffected by a single ion token.
It suffers the effect only when it has 2 or more ion
tokens assigned to it (all ion tokens are removed
at the end of the Activation phase).
```
## SPECIAL FIRING ARCS

```
Ships with an auxiliary firing arc can only fire their
primary weapon in this extended firing arc. Ships
with a turret primary weapon can fire the weapon
in any direction.
```

## HUGE SHIPS

```
Ships with the epic icon next to their title
can only be fielded in Epic Play and specific
Cinematic Play missions. They cannot be
fielded in 100 point Standard Play squads.
```
Huge ships count as a single ship consisting of 2
bases, 1 ship token, and 1 or 2 Ship cards.

The ship token is divided into halves by the blue
center line. The front base and the front half of the
ship token are the **fore section**. The rear base and
the rear half of the ship token are the **aft section**.

## SETUP

A huge ship’s base may extend outside of the
setup area as long as it has filled the length of that
area. It cannot be placed with any part of its bases
outside the play area.

## ACTIVATION

**The Activation phase now consists of 2 subphases:**

**a. Small and Large Ship Activation**
All small and large ships activate in order from
lowest pilot skill to highest pilot skill.

**b. Huge Ship Activation**
All huge ships activate in order from lowest pilot
skill to highest pilot skill.

Events that trigger at the end of the Activation
phase now trigger. All other standard rules for
activating ships apply.

## MOVEMENT

**To execute a straight maneuver:**

1. Place the huge ship maneuver template on either
    side of the ship’s front base with the bottom line
    of the template aligned with the rear edge of the
    ship’s front base.
2. Pick up the ship and place it so that the rear
    edge of the ship’s front base aligns with the
    revealed maneuver’s speed line.

```
To execute a bank maneuver:
```
1. Place the template on the side of the front base
    so that the bearing arrows on the template match
    the bearing of the revealed maneuver and the
    corner of the rear edge of the ship’s front base
    fits into the notch at the bottom of the template.
2. Place the ship so that the front corner of its
    front base fits into the right angle just below the
    chosen maneuver’s image on the template.

## COMBAT

```
Range
If a ship attacks at Range 4 with its primary weapon,
the defender rolls 2 additional defense dice.
If a ship attacks at Range 5 with its primary weapon,
the defender rolls 3 additional defense dice.
```
```
Obstructing
When a ship performs an attack, if its closest-point-
to-closest-point line passes through any part of a
section of a huge ship and that huge ship is not the
target, the attack is obstructed : the defender rolls 1
additional defense die.
```
```
Assault Missiles
If a huge ship is attacked by Assault Missiles ,
which damage all ships at Range 1 of the defender,
measure range from the targeted section. The other
section does not suffer damage in this case.
```
## TOKENS

```
Focus, Evade, and Stress Tokens
Focus, Evade and Stress tokens do not affect huge
ships. When a huge ship receives them, immediately
remove them and return them to the supply.
```
```
Ion Tokens
Instead of the standard effects of ion tokens, during
the Gain Energy step huge ships reduce the amount
of energy they gain by 1 for each ion token assigned
to them.
Then remove all ion tokens from the ship at the end
of the Activation phase.
```
```
Target Lock Tokens
A ship acquiring a target lock on a huge ship must
lock on a single section whose closest point is within
range. The target lock token is placed next to that
section and its effect applies only to that section.
```
## ENERGY

```
Energy Steps in the Activation Phase
To gain and spend energy, huge ships resolve
2 additional steps during the Activation phase
between the Clean Up and Perform Action steps in
this order:
```
**1. Gain Energy:** The huge ship gains a number of
    energy tokens equal to the number of energy
    icons shown on the chosen maneuver on the
    maneuver dial.

```
For each point of energy a huge ship gains, place
1 energy token on its Ship card.
```
**2. Use Energy:** The huge ship may use 1 or more
    of its Upgrade cards or Damage cards with the
    **Energy:** header. Each card with this header can
    be used only once per round.

```
Spent energy tokens are returned to the supply.
```
```
The maximum number of energy tokens a card can
have at any time is its energy limit (this can be
increased with certain upgrade cards).
```
```
If a card ever has a energy tokens exceeding its
energy limit, immediately return the excess tokens
to the supply. Energy tokens remain on cards until
removed by an effect.
```
## OVERLAPPING

```
Overlapping Huge Ships
When a huge ship ends its maneuver overlapping
with one of its sections one or more huge ships, use
the normal overlapping rules.
However the ship that moved does not skip its
Perform Actions step. Instead, both ships are
dealt 1 faceup Damage card from the deck that
corresponds to its affected ship section.
```
```
Overlapping Small or Large Ships
When a huge ship ends its maneuver with one of
its sections overlapping one or more small or large
ships, those ships are immediately destroyed.
```
```
The huge ship completes its maneuver and does not
skip its Perform Actions step.
```
```
Then the huge ship’s player rolls 1 attack die for
each small ship destroyed and 2 dice for each large
ship destroyed. The ship’s fore section suffers any
damage and critical damage rolled.
```
```
Overlapping Obstacles
When a huge ship ends its maneuver with one
of its sections overlapping one or more obstacle
tokens, the huge ship is dealt 1 faceup Damage
card from the deck that corresponds to his affected
ship section (the opposing player chooses if both
sections overlap). The ship does not skip its Perform
Actions step.
The overlapped obstacle tokens are immediately
removed from play.
```
```
Small or Large Ships Overlapping a Huge Ship
When a small or large ship ends its maneuver with
its base overlapping a huge ship, the overlapping
ship follows the normal overlapping rules.
```
```
Then the overlapping ship’s player rolls 1 attack
die and suffers any damage and critical damage
rolled.
```
## OTHER RULES

```
Modifications Huge ships can only equip
modifications that are labeled Huge Ship only.
```
```
Free Actions Huge ships cannot perform free actions.
```
```
Huge Ships as Obstacles To use a huge ship as an
obstacle during a standard game, flip its token to
the starfield side and follow the standard rules for
adding obstacles; however one player places the
ship first instead of 3 asteroid tokens.
The huge ship obstacle is not controlled by any
player, does not move, and cannot be attacked,
damaged, or destroyed.
```

## CR

## ACTIONS

## Recover

```
Remove all energy tokens from the ship’s card.
The ship recovers 1 shield on either of its sections
for each token removed. You cannot exceed a ship
card’s shield value.
```
## Reinforce

```
Place 1 reinforce token next to the ship’s fore
or aft section. The token adds 1 result to the
ship’s defense roll if assigned to the targeted
section. This does not spend the token: remove all
reinforce tokens during the End phase.
```
## Target Lock

```
Acquire target locks as normal. The blue target
lock is placed next to the ship and can be spent
by either section.
```
## Coordinate

```
Choose another friendly ship at Range 1–2 to
immediately perform 1 free action.
```
```
During the Perform Action step, the CR90 may
perform 2 actions.
The first must be an action in the fore section’s
action bar or from one of that section’s Upgrade
or Damage cards. The second must be an action
in the aft section’s action bar or from one of that
section’s Upgrade or Damage cards. Measure
range from the CR90 base’s closest point to the
affected ship(s).
```
## COMBAT

```
Targeting the CR
Measure from the center of the attacker’s base to
the centre of the fore or aft section base. If this is
not obstructed by the CR90’s blue center line, the
chosen section can be targeted.
Range is from the closest point of the attacker to
the closest point of the chosen section within the
attacker’s fire arc. The attacker may choose another
section if he cannot target the chosen section.
```
```
Attacks
The CR90 may perform 1 attack with its primary
weapon (the fore turret) and 1 attack with each
of its secondary weapons during the Combat
phase. It must finish one attack before beginning
another. A secondary weapon may target ships
within either fire arc in its corresponding section.
```
```
Range
If the ship’s primary weapon attacks at Range 4 ,
the defender rolls 2 additional defense dice.
At Range 5 , the defender rolls 3 additional
defense dice.
```
```
Agility
The CR90 has an agility of 0 , but can roll
additional defense dice granted by cards, range
modifiers, obstructed attacks etc.
```
```
Damage
When required, draw a Damage card from the
targeted section deck. If an effect damages both
sections (or the section is not specified), the
opposing player chooses one.
All Damage cards placed next to the CR90’s Ship
card count against its hull value.
```
```
Crippled Sections
A section is crippled when the number of Damage
cards on a section equals or exceeds its hull value.
Flip that Ship card, then choose and discard any
Upgrade cards and Energy tokens in excess of
the icons and energy limit on that side. Crippled
sections cannot be targeted and cannot suffer
damage. If both sections are crippled, the CR
is destroyed.
```
## ENERGY

```
Resolve these 2 steps during the Activation phase
between the Clean Up and Perform Action steps:
```
**1. Gain Energy:** The ship gains energy tokens
    equal to the number of energy icons shown on
    its chosen maneuver.
**2. Use Energy:** The ship may use 1 or more of
    its Upgrade cards or Damage cards with the
    **Energy:** header (each only once per round).

```
For each point of energy the ship gains, place 1
energy token on its Ship card.
```
```
The maximum number of energy tokens a card
can have at any time is its energy limit. Energy
tokens remain on cards until removed by effects.
```
## ACTIONS

## Recover

```
Remove all energy tokens from the ship’s card.
The ship recovers 1 shield for each token removed.
You cannot exceed a ship card’s shield value.
```
## Reinforce

```
Place 1 reinforce token next to the ship’s fore
or aft section. The token adds 1 result to the
ship’s defense roll if assigned to the targeted
section. This does not spend the token: remove all
reinforce tokens during the End phase.
```
## Jam

```
Choose 1 enemy ship at Range 1–2 and assign it
stress tokens until it has a total of 2 stress tokens.
```
## Coordinate

```
Choose another friendly ship at Range 1–2: it may
immediately perform 1 free action.
```
## COMBAT

```
Targeting the GR-
Choose the fore or aft section and measure from
the center of the attacker’s base to the centre of
the section base. If this is not obstructed by the
GR-75’s blue center line, the chosen section can
be targeted.
```
```
Range is from the closest point of the attacker
to the closest point of the chosen section within
the attacker’s fire arc. The attacker may choose
another section if he cannot target the chosen
section.
```
```
Attacks
The GR-75 cannot perform an attack during the
Combat phase.
```
```
Agility
The GR-75 has an agility of 0 , but can roll
additional defense dice granted by cards, range
modifiers, obstructed attacks etc.
```
```
Damage
When required, draw a Damage card from the
targeted section deck. If an effect damages both
sections (or the section is not specified), the
opposing player chooses one.
```
```
All Damage cards placed next to the GR-75’s
Ship card count against its hull value.
```
## ENERGY

```
Energy Steps in the Activation Phase
Resolve 2 additional steps during the Activation
phase between the Clean Up and Perform Action
steps:
```
**1. Gain Energy:** The ship gains energy tokens
    equal to the number of energy icons shown on
    its chosen maneuver.
**2. Use Energy:** The ship may use 1 or more of
    its Upgrade cards or Damage cards with the
    **Energy:** header (each only once per round).

```
For each point of energy the ship gains, place 1
energy token on its Ship card.
```
```
The maximum number of energy tokens a card
can have at any time is its energy limit. Energy
tokens remain on cards until removed by effects.
