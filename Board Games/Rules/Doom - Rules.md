# Doom (2004)
## Brief Summary
Doom (2004) is a board game adaptation of the iconic first-person shooter video game. Players take on the roles of either space marines or the invading forces of Hell in a tactical combat scenario. The game features asymmetric gameplay, with marines exploring a modular board and fighting against waves of monsters controlled by the invader player.

# Doom - Rules
#### Setup

**1. Choose Roles** One player is the **invader** and the
    others are _marines_. The invader only has the figures
    of the colour(s) of the marine figures to use in the
    game.
**2. Invader Setup** The invader player (IP) chooses a
    scenario, chooses an invader deck, sets up the
    starting area, and receives 5 invader cards (not
    revealed to the marine player). Swap allowed figures
    for _equivalent_ figures as desired.
**3. Marine Setup** Each marine player (MP) receives an
    equipment bin plus tokens and cards (revealed face
    up) as follows:

```
## Marines Shells/Bullets Wounds Armor Cards
1 4 10 2 3
2 3 9 2 3
3 2 8 2 2
```
#### Order of Play

**Turn 1: First Marine Player’s Turn**
Choose an action
Resolve action

**Turn 2: Second Marine Player’s Turn**

**Turn 3: Third Marine Player’s Turn**

**Turn 4: Invader Player’s Turn**
Draw and discard
Spawn
Activate invaders

#### Marine Turn

Choose one action from the following four:

**1. Sprint**
_Move:_ up to 8 spaces.
_Attack:_ cannot attack.
**2. Unload**
_Move:_ cannot move.
_Attack:_ up to 2 attacks during the turn.
**3. Advance**
_Move:_ up to 4 spaces.
_Attack:_ may make 1 attack during the turn.
**4. Ready**
_M/A:_ move up to 4 spaces _OR_ 1 attack.
_Order:_ **may place 1 marine order**.

#### Invader Turn

**Draw and Discard
The IP must draw 2 cards from the invader deck.** If the
IP has more than 8 cards he must immediately discard
cards to bring the total to 8.

When the last card in the deck is drawn the IP scores
**1 Frag point** and shuffles the discard pile as a new deck.

**Event cards** can be played at any time as long as the
conditions on the card are met.

```
Spawn
The IP may play 1 Spawn card , taking the invaders
shown on the card and placing them on the board.
Invaders cannot be placed in the line of sight of any
marine—other invader figures do not block line of sight.
Otherwise a figure cannot be placed.
```
```
The IP cannot place more invaders than the figures
available, though a figure may be removed from the
board to make it available.
```
```
Activate Invaders
Each invader on the board may be activated once;
moving a number of spaces up to its movement score
and attacking at any time during the move.
```
#### Movement

```
Figures may move diagonally; pass through friendly
figures as long as they end their turn in an empty space;
move around enemy figures (unless that figure has the
watchful ability); and may make attacks at any point
during movement. Facing has no effect.
```
```
Figures may not move into or through closed doors,
blocking obstacles, or enemy figures at any time.
```
#### Attacking

```
Figures cannot attack when occupying the same square.
```
```
Every attack follows these steps:
```
**1. Declare Attack**
Declare which _space_ is being attacked, and, if a
    marine, the weapon used.

```
Melee attacks can only be made from an adjacent
square; invaders marked with a red bar may only
make melee attacks. Marines always have the fist,
pistol and grenade attacks , marked in green.
```
**2. Confirm Line of Sight**
Figures must be able to trace an _uninterrupted_
    straight line between the centres of the spaces.
**3. Count Range & Roll Attack**
If a ranged attack, determine _range_ by counting the
    number of spaces to the targeted space.

```
Roll the dice corresponding to the invader’s attack or
the marine’s weapon.
```
**4. Determine Attack Success**
Any _miss_ result results in a failed attack ( _this is the_
    _only way a melee attack can miss_ ). The attack _hits_ if
    the total range numbers shown on the dice are equal
    to or greater than the range.
       **5. Inflict Wounds**
       The total number of **bullet holes** is the total damage.
          This must be equal to or greater than the target’s
          armor rating.

```
Every increment of damage equal to the target’s
armor rating equals one wound. Marines remove a
wound token and invaders place a wound token next
to the figure.
```
#### Re-rolls

```
A single attack can never be re-rolled more than once.
The affects of a opposing dodge and an aimed attack
cancel each other out.
```
#### Scatter

```
Weapons with the blast ability will scatter if they miss
(either by insufficient range or a miss result).
```
```
Draw the top card of the invader deck, turn it so the
compass rose direction is matching that on the board,
then find the space indicated by the number and
direction shown from the original target space. The
attack will hit this new space if moving to it does not
pass through any walls, blocking obstacles, or closed
doors. If it does, or the card shows a miss icon, it will
explode harmlessly.
```
#### Ammo (Marines only)

```
To attack with a given weapon a marine must have at
least one corresponding ammo token on his ammo bin.
Those with an infinity symbol do not require ammo.
```
```
If one or more attack dice show a bullet icon , 1 ammo
token of the appropriate type must be discarded.
```
#### Equipment Tokens (Marines only)

```
Equipment tokens can only be picked up by marines,
and are automatically picked up by a marine in the same
space.
```
```
During his turn, a marine may give weapon or ammo
tokens to adjacent marines at a cost of 1 movement
point per token.
```
```
Ammo, Armor Place the token on the marine’s
equipment bin.
```
```
Health Discard the token and return up to 3 wound
markers previously discarded.
```
```
Keys Place the token by the compass rose; any security
doors of that colour are now unlocked.
```
```
Weapons Place the token on the marine’s reference sheet
to indicate he can use the weapon.
```
```
Adrenaline At the start of a subsequent turn the token
may be discarded to add 4 spaces of movement for that
turn.
Beserk Place the token by the marine’s equipment bin
with the unfaded side up; the marine may only attack
with his fists, but any attack instantly kills any invader.
At the end of the marine’s next turn, flip the token; at
the end of the following turn, discard the token.
```

#### Doors

Doors block movement and all attacks. It costs a
figure located on one of the adjacent squares to a door
**2 spaces of movement** to open or close it. A door cannot
be closed if an oversized invader blocks it.

**Security Doors**
Security doors begin play locked; once a key of the
appropriate colour has been found all security doors of
this colour are unlocked for marines. Invaders can never
open or close a security door.

**Airlocks**
Airlocks automatically close at the end of any turn they
were opened (this cannot be prevented by a marine with
the _Tech Op_ card; and any large invader blocking the door
is killed). Airlocks cannot be destroyed by a _Smash_ card.

#### Sentry Bots

Sentry bots appear on the map in an _unactivated_ state,
can do nothing and cannot take damage. Treat as an
enemy figure for purposes of moving or attacking through
the space.

A marine can _activate_ a bot by moving adjacent to it
and expending 2 movement points. The marine is now
in control of the bot (and can control a maximum of
2 at once). The bot takes a turn immediately after the
controlling marine’s turn and may move up to 4 spaces
and attack once.

Bots can benefit from the _Officer_ bonus to range and
damage. They may not perform any special movement
(including opening/closing doors) except moving through
teleporters. They cannot have orders placed on them,
and cannot normally be healed.

Invaders are not prevented from spawning within a
bot’s LOS.

#### Other Terrain, Obstacles and Objects

```
Airless Terrain
Each time a marine ends his turn on an airless terrain
space, he must discard an oxygen cylinder token or
suffer 2 wounds (regardless of armor).
```
```
Board Exits
Once a marine has moved off the board he may not
return.
```
```
Damaging Obstacles
Do not block line of sight or movement, but a figure
entering a damaging obstacle space suffers 1 wound
regardless of armor. A marine fragged in this manner still
gives a frag point to the IP.
```
```
A figure remaining on a damaging obstacle for its entire
turn/activation takes an additional wound at the end of
its turn/activation.
```
```
Ducts
Ducts work just like teleporters but can only be used by
invaders with the scuttle ability. Invaders cannot move
to ducts that are not revealed or are being stood upon
by a marine.
```
```
Exploding Barrels
Exploding barrels block line of sight and movement.
They explode if they suffer 1 point of damage, dealing
1 automatic wound to all figures adjacent.
Flame Jets
At the end of every round, flip all flame jet markers to
their other side. A figure suffers 1 wound (regardless
of armor) when entering , leaving or ending its turn in a
space with a ‘on’ flame jet, or being in the space when
it turns ‘on’.
```
```
Teleporters
With 1 space of movement a marine or sentry bot only
may move from one teleporter to another of the same
colour (even if the other end has yet to be revealed).
```
```
A marine teleporting into a space occupied by an invader
automatically kills it.
```
#### Oversized Invaders

```
Oversized figures can only be targeted once by a single
attack, even if they occupy multiple spaces.
```
```
Demons
Demons occupy 2 spaces, and either move one half into
a non-diagonal adjacent space while the other half moves
into the space just vacated, or move both halves into a
diagonally adjacent space by moving both halves in the
same diagonal direction.
```
#### Exploring

```
Whenever a marine has line of sight to an unrevealed
portion of the board it is immediately set up by the IP
and any required text from the Scenario read aloud.
```
#### Frags and Kills

```
Killed invaders are removed from the board and returned
to the IP’s reserves.
```
```
Killed ( fragged ) marines are removed from the board.
The marine returns to his starting wound and armor
tokens, discarding any extras (including beserk tokens)
picked up during the game.
```
```
At the start of his next turn the marine is respawned
back on the board on a revealed empty space at least 8
but no more than 16 spaces away from where the marine
was fragged. If no space meets these conditions, meet
them as closely as possible.
After a marine has been fragged the IP takes a frag token
and keeps it as a frag point.
Accumulated frag points may win the game, depending
on the scenario.
```
#### Timing and ‘Start of Turn’

```
Event cards to be played at the start of the IP turn
are played after draw and discard, but before invader
activation.
```
```
Those to be played immediately before a marine takes
his turn can be played until the MP declares his action.
```

#### SPECIAL ABILITIES

###### ACCURACY

```
After attacking, add +1 to the range for each Accuracy icon.
```
```
AGILE
Always dodge any attack directed against them, forcing the re-roll of
some or all of the dice. Second result must be accepted.
```
```
AIMED
After rolling for the attack, may re-roll some or all of the dice. Second
result must be accepted.
```
```
BLAST
Attacks affect an area within x number of spaces of the target space
( x is the number of Blast icons). Blast areas cannot pass through walls,
closed doors, or blocking obstacles. The attack deals full damage to each
creature in the area. If the attack is dodged by more than one figure
only one re-roll may be made (first dodging player to the attacker’s left).
If a blast attack misses, it can scatter.
```
```
BLOW-THROUGH
Attacks can be walked into multiple spaces , one after the other. After the
initial attack (regardless of success), attacker may roll another against an
adjacent space by removing either 1 green or 1 blue die from the attack.
The attack may continue to further adjacent spaces as long as a die is
dropped each time. No attack roll needs to be made for empty spaces.
```
```
DEADLY
After rolling for the attack, add +1 to the damage for each icon.
```
```
DOUBLE ATTACK
Figure may attack twice.
```
```
FLYING
May move through enemies and blocking obstacles , but must end move
in an empty space. May move through or end their move on damaging
obstacles without effect.
```
```
KNOCKBACK
After inflicting at least 1 damage after applying wounds, the attacker
may immediately move each affected target figure up to 3 empty spaces.
The spaces may contain damaging obstacles or other non-blocking tokens.
The movement is not blocked by intervening figures or obstacles, but it
cannot be moved through a closed door or wall.
SCUTTLE
Can move between ducts as though they were adjacent (for 1 space of
movement), though not to a duct occupied by a marine figure or one not
yet revealed.
```
```
SEEKING
Attacks do not need line of sight to the target square. Max range is 8
spaces. These attacks still cannot pass though a closed door or wall,
but can pass through blocking obstacles.
```
```
SOUL DRAIN
Targets any space with LOS up to 8 spaces away. Target is immediately
killed unless a miss is rolled. If the attack kills at least one figure, the
attacker is healed of 3 wounds.
```
```
SWEEP
Deals full damage to all enemy figures adjacent to the attacker. If the
attack is dodged by more than one figure only one re-roll may be made
(the first dodging player to the attacker’s left).
```
```
TELEKINESIS
Attacks, with a single roll, every space containing an enemy in LOS. If miss
is rolled, all attacks fail, otherwise all targets up to rolled range are hit.
```
```
WATCHFUL
May immediately make one free attack against any enemy figure that
moves into an adjacent square. The attack takes place before the moving
figure may make any other action. No limit to the these free attacks, and
several attacks may be made if the same figure moves into more than one
adjacent space.
