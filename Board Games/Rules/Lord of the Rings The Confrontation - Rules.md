# Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation

## Brief Summary

# Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation - Rules

## Setup

1. The Fellowship player takes the 9 Fellowship
    character tiles in the white pieces, and the 9
    Fellowship Combat cards.
2. The Sauron player takes the 9 evil character tiles in
    the black pieces, and the 9 Sauron Combat cards.
3. In the Classic game, the characters all show the One
    Ring symbol.
4. The board is placed so the Shire is pointing at the
    Fellowship player and Mordor is pointing at the
    Sauron player.
5. The Fellowship player places 4 characters in the
    Shire, and each of his remaining 5 in one of the 5
    regions in front of the Shire.
6. The Sauron player places 4 characters in Mordor,
    and each of his remaining 5 in one of the five regions
    in front of Mordor.
7. All characters are placed with their hidden side
    facing the opponent.

It is recommended that 2 games are played, with players
each playing a side. The winner of each game receives
one point for each of his characters still on the board at
the end of the game.

After 2 games the player with the highest point total in
the overall winner.

## Game Round

The Sauron player takes the first turn, then play
alternates.

## Movement

A player must move one of his characters forward to an
adjacent region.

Characters can never move sideways in the mountains,
not even with the use of special abilities.

Each player may never have more than four characters
each in the Shire or Mordor, only one in each mountain
region, and up to 2 in all other regions.

A character may never move into or through a region
that already holds the maximum number of his own
characters.

A player may shuffle his characters in a region at any
time to confuse his opponent.

```
The River Anduin
The Fellowship player only may move characters from
Mirkwood to Fangorn or Fangorn to Rohan. This is
considered a forward move. Forward movement in the
opposite direction is not allowed.
The Tunnel of Moria
The Fellowship player only may move characters forward
through the Tunnel of Moria from Eregion into Fangorn
(but never in the opposite direction) even if retreating.
```
```
If the Sauron player reveals the Balrog in the Caradhras
region at this time, the character is instantly defeated.
```
## Battle

```
if a character is moved into a region occupied by one or
more characters, it is the attacker in a battle.
```
```
If there are 2 or more unrevealed opponents in the
region, the attacker randomly chooses which will be
his opponent for the battle. Otherwise the attacker
may choose a specific enemy character that is already
revealed in the region.
```
1. Reveal Characters Both players reveal their character.
2. Resolve Character Abilities The Fellowship player
reads and resolves any special ability _first_ , followed
by the Sauron player. ( _Exception:_ the Warg).

```
Some Fellowship characters may retreat at the start
of the battle. A character can never retreat into
a region occupied by an enemy, sideways in the
mountains, backwards through Moria or upstream
against the Anduin, or into a region with the
maximum number of characters in it.
```
3. Play Cards Both players secretly select a remaining
    Combat card and they are revealed simultaneously.
    Text cards _always_ take effect before Strength cards.
    If both players reveal Text cards, the Sauron player’s
    card is read and resolved _first_.
4. Compare Strengths If the battle is still on, the
    Strength number of each player’s Strength card is
    added to the Strength value of the character. The
    character with the lowest total is defeated. If there
    is a tie, both are defeated.

```
When a character is defeated it is placed face up by
the game board.
```
```
Used Combat cards are discarded face up by the
board. When all 9 Combat cards have been used,
both players take all of their cards back.
```
```
After a battle, if there are still additional enemies in the
region, another begins, until all are resolved. A player’s
turn does not end until all battles are resolved and only
Fellowship or Sauron characters (or none at all) occupy
each region.
```
```
At the end of a battle or after a retreat, any revealed
non-defeated characters are hidden from the opponent
again.
```
## Game End

```
The Fellowship player wins immediately if Frodo enters
Mordor, even if there are Sauron characters there.
```
```
The Sauron player wins immediately if he has either 3
characters in the Shire or if Frodo (classic version) is
defeated.
If a player is unable to move a character forward during
his turn he loses immediately.
```
## Variant Game

```
In the variant game the characters are switched to the
side showing the Star symbol.
```
```
The Sauron player wins immediately if the Witch King
enters the Shire, even if there are Fellowship characters
there.
```
```
A defeated Frodo can make Sam the new Ringbearer.
Sam is revealed at this time. If Sam is not on the board
when Frodo is defeated, the Sauron player immediately
wins. When Sam is the Ringbearer, the Fellowship player
wins immediately if Sam enters Mordor, even if there
are Sauron characters there. If Sam as the Ringbearer is
defeated, the Sauron player immediately wins.
```
## Draft Game

```
Each player chooses which characters he wishes to field.
Once chosen they are revealed to the other player, who
may use the character tokens as a reminder. Alternatively,
character choices may not be revealed before the game.
```
## Special Cards

```
Players choose 2 Special cards for the game, or each
player chooses a number between 0 and 4, then picks
that number of his opponent’s Special cards for his
opponent to use. The Special cards are not subject to the
Combat card rules. Each Special card may only be used
once per game.
