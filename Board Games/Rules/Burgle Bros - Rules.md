# Burgle Bros - Rules

Burgle Bros. is a cooperative game for 1-4 players. The Burgle
Bros. are an elite crew that pulls off impossible heists. Get in,
get out, and don't get caught. Avoid Alarms, sneak past Guards,
crack all the Safes, and get to the roof to escape!

You win when you crack all the Safes, take their Loot and escape
to the roof. But you lose if any member of your crew is caught by
a guard without a Stealth token. Then, under pressure, they end
up giving up information about their fellow Burgle Bros.!

Setup

The standard scenario for the Burgle Bros. is The Bank Job. It has
3 floors and should take about 90 minutes to play. More scenar-
ios are available on page 11.

Set up the building

1. Set aside the 3 Safe tiles Oo and the 3 Stairs << tiles.

2. Shuffle the other 42 room tiles, then separate them into 3
decks of 14 tiles each.

3. Place 1 Safe tile and 1 Stairs tile in each of the 3 room decks.

4. Shuffle each room deck together, then deal each deck face
down into a 4x4 grid to form the 3 floors of the bank.

5. Place 8 Walls between room tiles on each floor (see the dia-
gram The Bank Job). When tiles have a Wall between them,
they are not considered adjacent.

After the Walkway is revealed, you do not fall if you Move into
the tile. You can choose to Move downstairs from the Walkway
at the cost of 1 action, as normal. When you Move downstairs
from the Walkway, ignore effects for entering the tile (such as the
Deadbolts or Fingerprint Alarms). You cannot Move upstairs
from the tile below the Walkway.

Detector (Alarm): When you Move into a Detector tile, you
trigger an Alarm if you have a Tool or Loot card. If you don't
have any Tools or Loot, nothing happens.

Safe: You must be in the Safe tile to take the Add a Die or Crack
actions. Safe tiles start with no dice on them, and each Safe tile
can have up to 6 dice.

Service Duct: There are two Service Duct tiles. After both Ser-
vice Ducts have been discovered, you can Move between them
as if they were adjacent tiles, even if the Service Ducts are on
different floors.

Stairs: When you reveal a Stairs tile, add a Downstairs token

on the corresponding tile on the next floor up. You can Peek or
Move to that tile from the Stairs, and you can Move down to the
Stairs from that tile. Moving from the Stairs to an upper floor’s
tile counts as entering that tile.

After your team has all the Loot, you can spend 1 action to Move
out via the top floor’s Stairs, exiting the game.

Thermo (Alarm): If you end your actions while you are in a
Thermo tile, you trigger an Alarm. You do not trigger an Alarm
by moving here during other turns (usually by Character abili-
ties or Event cards).

Secret Door: You can Move into the Secret Door tile from any
adjacent tile, even through a Wall. You cannot Move or Peek out
of this tile through a Wall. Guards don’t know about the Secret
Doors, so Guards will not move through Secret Doors.

Walkway: If you reveal the Walkway by Moving into it, place
your Character piece on the corresponding tile on the floor be-
low the Walkway. Falling into the tile below does not count as
“entering” the tile, so you do not have to spend extra actions to
Move safely (for example, Deadbolt or Laser tiles) and you do
not discard a Stealth token if a Guard is in the tile.

If you reveal the Walkway by Peeking, or if you're already on the
lowest floor, nothing happens.

Ready the Guards

. Sort the Patrol cards into 3 decks by their floor, marked on
the bottom-right corner.

. Shuffle each Patrol deck, then place each deck face-down near
its floor. If you're playing with fewer than 4 players, discard some
of the Patrol cards from each deck without looking at them.

3 players: discard 3 Patrol cards
2 players: discard 6 Patrol cards
1 players: discard 9 Patrol cards

. Put a Guard piece next to each Patrol deck.

. Put a red Guard die next to each Patrol deck. Each die indi-
cates the number of spaces that floor’s Guard can move, so
place each die with the following numbers showing:

Floor 1: 2 on the Guard die
Floor 2: 3 on the Guard die
Floor 3: 4 on the Guard die

Prepare the Events, Tools, and Loot

. Separate the cards for the Events &© , Tools > a
and Loot -™ .

. Shuffle each deck individually, then place each deck face-
down beside the play area.

Pick your crew

. Each player randomly draws a Character card and chooses
one side to use. Each Character card has a special ability that
the player can use as the card says. The side labeled Advanced
Skill is recommended only for advanced players.

. Give each player the Character piece for their card and 3
Stealth @ Iokens. Stealth tokens represent your ability to
quickly hide from Guards when they show up, but you can't
hide forever.

Foyer: If a Guard is in an adjacent tile while you are in it, the
Guard can see into the tileto find you, so you must discard 1
Stealth token. A Wall prevents the Guard from seeing into the
Foyer. If the Guard enters your tile (or enters another adjacent
tile), you must discard an additional Stealth token. If 2 Foyers
are adjacent, the effect doesn’t chain together; Guards cannot see
“across” one Foyer into another.

Keypad: When you Move into the Keypad tile (even on another
player’s turn), you must guess the tile’s code. As part of the Move
action, roll 1 die:

- If you roll a 6, you guess the code correctly. You enter the
tile, and any other player can enter the tile without having to
guess the code. Place an Open token @ on this tile to show
that your team knows the code.

- If you dont roll a 6, you guess incorrectly. You spend your
action to Move, but you stay in your previous tile. If you
spend more Move actions on the same turn to guess the code
again, roll an extra die for each time this turn that you've
guessed incorrectly.

For example, if you spend 4 Move actions in a single turn to
Move into a Keypad tile, you roll 1 die on your first action, 2 dice
on your second action, 3 dice on your third action, and so on.

If you are in the Keypad tile when it doesn’t have an Open token
(such as at the beginning of the game), you may Move out of the
tile as normal, but you must guess the code to Move in again later.

Laboratory: The first player to Move into the Laboratory draws
a Tool card.

Lavatory: When the Lavatory is revealed, place 3 Stealth tokens on
it (for its 3 stalls). If you would discard a Stealth token while you
are in the Lavatory, you can discard a Stealth token from the tile in-
stead of your own. You cannot pick up Stealth tokens from the tile.

Laser (Alarm): When you Move into a Laser tile, you trigger an
Alarm unless you spend 2 actions to Move safely into it.

Motion (Alarm): If you Move into and Move out of a Motion
tile in a single turn, you trigger an Alarm. You can avoid trig-
gering the Alarm if you wait until your next turn to Move out.

Stamp: While you have the Stamp, you must draw an Event card
when you take 3 or fewer actions on your turn (instead of the
usual 2 or fewer actions).

Tiara: While you have the Tiara, you must discard 1 Stealth token
each time you Move into a tile that is adjacent to a Guard (as well
as discarding 1 Stealth token if you Move into a Guard's tile). This
applies only when players Move, not the movement of Guards.

Room Tiles

Atrium: When you Peek from the Atrium, you may Peek at an
adjacent tile (as normal) or at the corresponding tile on the floor
directly above or below the Atrium. If a Guard is directly above
or below the Atrium while you are in it, the Guard can see into
the tile to find you, so you must discard a Stealth token.

Camera (Alarm): When a Guard piece is in a Camera tile, the
Guard can see all other revealed Camera tiles on any floor. If
you are in a Camera tile when a Guard is in another Camera
tile (even when they move through a Camera tile), you trigger
an Alarm in your current tile but do not discard a Stealth token.

Computer: You can only take the Hack action when you are in
a Computer tile. See the Hack action for details. Each Computer
tile can store up to 5 Hack tokens. Hack tokens from each Com-
puter tile can only be used to cancel the corresponding type of
Alarm: Fingerprint, Laser, or Motion.

Deadbolt: If another player or a Guard is in the Deadbolt tile,
you can Move into it normally. (Remember: if you Move into a
tile with a Guard, you discard a Stealth token.) Otherwise, you
must spend 3 actions to Move into the Deadbolt tile. If you can't
spend 3 actions (such as when Moving into this tile without
Peeking first), you stay in your previous tile.

Fingerprint (Alarm): When you Move into a Fingerprint tile, you
trigger an Alarm. Unlike other Alarm tile, there is no way to avoid
triggering a Fingerprint Alarm unless you spend a Hack token from
the Fingerprint Computer tile or use a Character or Tool ability.

Break in

1. Reveal the top card on the first floor’s Patrol deck. (Don’t
reveal cards for the Guards on other floors yet. Those Guards
will be placed when a player Moves to the other floors.)

2. Place the first floor’s Guard piece on the tile shown on that card.

3. Choose any tile on the first floor for your team to enter the
building. Flip over that tile and place a Downstairs token
on it to mark it as the entrance. Each player places their
Character piece on this tile at the start of their first turn.
Starting on this tile does not trigger any effects, such as set-
ting off an Alarm, but after your first action, you trigger the
tile’s effects normally.

4, Reveal the next card on the first floor’s Patrol deck. Place the
first floor’s Guard die on the tile shown on that card. This
is the Guard’s destination, so keep out of his path to avoid
losing a Stealth token!

5. The player who has most recently taken money out of a bank
goes first.

To win, open all 3 Safes and escape with the Loot through the
Stairs on the top floor without getting caught.

Gameplay
On each turn:
1. Take up to 4 actions.
2. Check for events (if you take 2 or fewer actions).
3. Move the Guard on your current floor.

Turns proceed clockwise from the first player.

Take Actions

Each turn, take up to 4 actions from the list below. You can take
these actions in any order, and you can take the same action
multiple times each turn.

Peek at a tile: Reveal an adjacent room tile. You do not enter
the tile, and the tile is permanently revealed (flipped over) to
all players. You may not Peek diagonally or through Walls. You
must verbally declare whether you're Peeking or Moving before
revealing the tile.

Peeking is a safe way to find Alarms without activating them, but
it takes longer than Moving.

Move to a tile: Move to an adjacent tile. You may not Move diag-
onally or through Walls.

If you Move into a tile that a Guard is in, you must discard 1 Stealth
token. (If you must spend a stealth token and do not have one, you
lose the game!) You can take actions while in a tile with a Guard
without losing additional Stealth tokens; only Moving causes you
to lose Stealth tokens.

You can Move to a tile even if it has not been revealed, but it’s
riskier than Peeking first. If you Move to a tile that has not been
revealed, reveal the tile (flip it over permanently) and follow its
text as a part of your Move action.

Some tiles, like Stop tiles and Alarm tiles, have requirements for
Moving into them.:

Stop tiles: you may not enter this tile. You remain on
your previous tile. (This doesn’t count as re-entering
the previous tile.)

Alarm tiles: you successfully Move to the tile, but you
trigger an Alarm. The Guard on your floor will come
to investigate the Alarm: see Alarms below for details.
If the Guard is currently in the Alarm tile, you do not
trigger the Alarm.

ry

Cursed Goblet: When you draw the Cursed Goblet, discard 1
Stealth token (to a minimum of 0 Stealth tokens) immediately. If
you have 0 Stealth tokens remaining, you are not affected and do
not immediately lose the game.

Gemstone: While you have the Gemstone, you must spend 1
additional action each time you Move into a tile that already has
1 or more other players.

Gold Bar: When you draw the Gold Bar, search the Loot deck
for the other Gold Bar card and place the other Gold Bar in the
Safe tile. Then, shuffle the Loot deck. Your team must take both
Gold Bars in order to win. Each player can hold only 1 Gold Bar,
though you can always trade Gold Bar as normal.

Isotope: While you have the Isotope, you trigger an Alarm im-
mediately when you Move into a Thermo tile.

Keycard: After you draw the Keycard, the player with the Key-
card must be in the Safe tile in order to take the Crack action. If
player with the Keycard is not in the Safe tile, you cannot roll any
dice to Crack the Safe.

Mirror: While you have the Mirror, you must take 1 fewer ac-
tion each turn (usually, this means 3). However, you also do not
trigger Alarms in Laser tiles.

Painting: While you have the Painting, you cannot use the spe-
cial movement features of the Secret Door or Service Duct tiles.
You can still Move into and out of these tiles normally.

Persian Kitty: When you draw the Persian Kitty, do not place the
Persian Kitty token in play yet. While you have the Persian Kitty,
roll a die at the beginning of each of your turns. If you roll a 1 ora 2,
place the Kitty token in the adjacent tile that is closest to an Alarm
tile (not an Alarm token). (If you would place the Kitty token, but
no Alarm tiles are revealed on your floor, nothing happens.)

You can pick up the Persian Kitty when you are in the same tile as the
Kitty token, and picking up the Persian Kitty does not cost an action.

Once the Kitty token is in play, no player is considered to have
the Persian Kitty, so you cannot win the game without picking
up the Kitty token. Do not roll a die for the Persian Kitty while
the Kitty token is in play--it doesn’t move. The Kitty token does
not trigger any tile or card effects, including Alarms. 18

Tools

Tools are useful items that the Burgle Bros. can use to their ad-
vantage! You get Tools when you enter some tiles, when you
draw some Events, and when you Crack a Safe.

When you find a Tool, place it near your Character card. Follow
the text on the Tool to use it. You can use Tools only on your turn
as a free action. You cannot use a Tool during another action
to “interrupt” or react to another effect. Players in the same tile
can give and take Tools (with the player’s permission) as a free
action. You cannot drop Tools.

Donuts: Select one Guard in any tile on any floor. The next time
that Guard would move, the Guard doesn’t move.

E.M.P.: Remove all Alarms from all floors and cancel any Alarms
that would trigger on any floor until the start of your next turn.
Use the E.M.P. at any time during your actions, but before you
would move the Guard.

Thermal Bomb: Place a Thermal Bomb token eo in your cur-
rent tile and another Thermal Bomb token in the corresponding
tile on either the floor above you or below you. All players can
use these tiles as if they were Stairs. Also, you trigger an Alarm in
your current tile. Use the Thermal Bomb at any time during your
actions, but before you would move the Guard.

Virus: Place a total of 3 Hack tokens in any revealed Computer
tiles anywhere in the building.

Loot

Each piece of Loot is an item of great value, but also comes with
a penalty while you carry it! You get Loot when you Crack a Safe.

When you find Loot, place it near your Character card. You can-
not escape the building until your team has all the Loot. Players
in the same tile can give and take Loot (with the player’s permis-
sion) as a free action. You cannot drop Loot.

Bust: While you have the Bust, you may not use Tool cards (but
you can still hold Tools).

Chihuahua: While you have the Chihuahua, roll a die at the be-
ginning of each of your turns. If you roll a 6, an Alarm is trig-
gered on your tile by the Chihuahua's barking.

When you Move to a floor that does not have a Guard set up,
immediately place that floor’s Guard and destination using the
initial setup rules:

1. Reveal the top card on this floor’s Patrol deck.
2. Place this floor’s Guard piece on the tile shown on that card.

3. Reveal the next card on this floor’s Patrol deck. Place this
floor’s Guard die on the tile shown on that card.

Hack a computer: Add one Hack token to the Computer tile you
are in. You must be in a Computer tile to Hack. Each Computer
tile can hold up to 6 Hack tokens.

When any player triggers an Alarm, they may choose to discard
a Hack token to cancel the Alarm. The Hack token’s tile must
match the type of Alarm (Fingerprint, Laser, or Motion). Hack
tokens can cancel Alarms on any floor, regardless of the Com-
puter tile’s location.

Add a Die to a Safe (costs 2 actions): Place a die on a Safe tile
you are in. Adding a die costs 2 of your 4 actions, and you can't
spread these 2 actions across multiple turns. Safe tiles start with
no dice on them, so you must Add a Die at least once before you
can Crack the Safe. Each Safe can have up to 6 dice.

You can take the Add a Die action even if you've already placed
all the dice included with the game. Use some other token (beads,
pennies, etc.) to track how many dice are on each Safe tile.

Crack a safe: Roll all the dice that have been added to a Safe tile
you are in.

Before you can Crack the Safe, you must first discover the com-
bination. Use the Peek or Move actions to reveal all 6 tiles in the
same row and column as the safe, and check the number in the
bottom right corner of the tiles: all of those numbers make up the
combination.

If the number of any die matches the combination number on a
revealed tile, cover that tiles number with a Cracked token. One
die can match multiple tiles, even if the number was only rolled on
a single die. You don't need to know the entire combination before
you start trying to Crack the Safe, but you place a Cracked token
only on tiles that are revealed when you roll. 6

fiestas 4

 

When you roll to Crack the Safe, cover each tile’s
combination number with a Cracked token.

If you finished Cracking the Safe (in other words, all 6 numbers of
the combination have Cracked tokens on them), do the following:

1. Draw a Tool card from the Tool deck. (See Tools on page 17
for details.) Tools are beneficial items you can use on your turn.

2. Draw a Loot card from the Loot deck. (See Loot on page 17
for details.) Loot is valuable, but often gets in your way during
the heist.

3, Permanently add 1 to the movement of each Guard on your
current floor and any floors below your current floor. Rotate
the Guard die for these Guards to show their new movement
speed. They know the safe has been cracked, and they're on
the lookout for you!

If you did not finish Cracking the Safe, return all the dice to the
Safe tile. You can roll them all again with a later action.

Go with your Gut: If there is at least 1 adjacent, unrevealed tile,
you must Move into it. If you are adjacent to more than 1 un-
revealed tile, choose which one to Move into. For rooms with
special requirements, treat this Event as though you had spent
1 action, such as:

- Keypad: If the Keypad tile does not have an Open token, roll
1 die to Move into it as normal.

- Deadbolt: If the Deadbolt does not have an Open token, you
remain in your current tile because 1 action is not enough to
Move into it.

- Laser: You trigger an Alarm because you can't spend:2 ac-
tions to Move into it.

Gymnastics: All players can Move into a Walkway from the tile
below it until the start of your next turn. Because the effect ends
at the start of your next turn, you cannot benefit from this effect
without another player's ability or effect.

Peekhole: You may choose | tile to Peek at, including adjacent
tiles (as normal), tiles through Walls on your floor, or the corre-
sponding tile on the floor above or below your current tile. You
may also choose not to Peek at any tile.

Reboot: Add or remove Hack tokens so that all revealed Com-
puter tiles have 1 Hack token.

Shift Change: The Guard on your floor does not move this turn.
Instead, move the Guards on other floors that have been revealed
(see Take actions for information on placing Guards on upper
floors). If more than 1 Guard would move, the players choose
the order of the Guards’ movement.

Switch Signs: Swap the positions of the Guard on your floor and
the Guard die. If 1 or more Alarms are currently active, place the
Guard at the closest Alarm, deactivate the Alarm, then deter-
mine the Guard’s next destination as normal.

Throw Voice: If no Alarm is currently active, move the Guard
die 1 adjacent tile in any direction. Throw Voice cannot move
a destination through Walls or rooms with special movement
rules, such as Secret Doors, Service Ducts, or Stairs.

Where Is He?: Place the Guard on your floor at the current desti-
nation. If 1 or more Alarms are currently active, place the Guard
at the closest Alarm, deactivate the Alarm, then determine the
Guard’s next destination as normal. 16

Juicer (Reroute ability): Once per turn as a free action, you may
choose one of these options:

- Pick up an Alarm token from your current tile and draw a
new Patrol Card which becomes the Guards new destina-
tion. If you are already holding an Alarm token from this
effect, you cannot pick up a second Alarm token.

- Discard an Alarm token that you picked up on a previous
turn. This triggers an Alarm on your current tile.

Rook (Orders ability): Once per turn, spend 1 action to Move
another player 1 tile. That player ignores additional movement
costs, such as Deadbolts or Lasers. Follow all other Moving rules
normally, including unrevealed tiles, Stairs, and other move-
ment effects. Apply all other tile effects normally. If that player
Moves onto a locked Keypad, roll as normal using 1 die.

Rook (Disguise ability): You may spend the first action of a
turn to swap your Character piece with another player’s Char-
acter piece. Neither player is considered to have Moved into the
tile, so neither player triggers Alarms, discards Stealth tokens for
Guards, or pays extra movement costs.

Events

Change of Plans: If no Alarm is currently active, reveal the next
Patrol card as if the Guard on your floor had arrived at the cur-
rent destination.

Crash: If no Alarm is currently active, place this floor’s Guard
die in your current tile.

Freight Elevator: Place your Character piece in the corresponding
tile on the floor above your current tile. If you are on the top floor,
you immediately escape if the players are holding all the Loot; if
the players are not holding all the Loot, you can't escape to the roof.

Check for Events

After you finish your actions, if you used 2 or fewer actions, you
must draw an Event card and follow its text. Some events are
helpful to the Burgle Bros., but others may cause more problems.
You may not avoid drawing an Event card by simply Moving
back and forth between tiles.

Move the Guard

After your actions and events are complete, move the Guard piece
on your current floor--not the Guards on other floors. If the Guard
moves into a tile with a player, that player must discard 1 Stealth
token. (If you must spend a stealth token and do not have one, you
lose the game!)

Movement speed: The Guard’s movement is the number shown
on the Guard die: the Guard moves that many tiles on this turn.
If any Alarms are currently active, the Guard’s movement speed
is temporarily increased by 1 for each active Alarm. (The Guard’s
movement speed is set when the Guard starts to move, so Alarms
triggered or deactivated during the Guard’s movement don't
change the Guard’s movement speed.)

Destination: The Guard's destination is always the tile that con-
tains the Guard die. The destination is originally set by the Patrol
card revealed from the Patrol deck, but Alarms can move the
Guard die (and with it, the Guard’s destination).

The Guard always takes the shortest possible path to the desti-
nation. If more than one path is equally short, the Guard takes
the path that is the most clockwise, starting from the Guard’s
left. Like the Burgle Bros., Guards cannot move diagonally or
through Walls. Unlike the Burgle Bros., Guards ignore all special
movement rules on tiles, such as the Deadbolt or Walkway tiles,
because Guards have security clearance.

When the Guard arrives at the destination marked by the Guard die,
reveal the next Patrol card and place the Guard die on the location
shown on the Patrol card. If the Guard still has remaining movement
speed, continue moving the Guard toward the new destination.

The Guard changes destination during a turn:
Arrived at destination. Draw next Patrol card, 1 move remaining.

Alarms: When an Alarm is triggered, place both an Alarm to-
ken and that floor’s Guard die on the tile where the Alarm was
triggered. Each Alarm token temporarily adds 1 to the move-
ment speed of that floor’s Guard (until the Guard deactivates the
Alarm). Each tile can have only 1 Alarm token on it.

Strategy Tips
If a Guard is about to find another player, try to help:

+ Get to another floor. Only the Guard on your floor moves
at the end of your turn.

- Trigger an Alarm on this floor to change the Guard’s des-
tination.

- Spend 2 actions or fewer on your turn to draw an Event
card--and hope for the best!

Spread players across multiple floors of the building to slow
Guards down. :

Sometimes it’s a good idea to Move into a Guard’s tile (sac-
rificing a Stealth token) if the Guard is likely to move and
find you anyway. This is especially useful when the Guard is
in an Alarm tile, because you don't trigger an Alarm when
a Guard is present.

When your team has all the Loot, get out as quickly as possible!
After you leave the building, Guards don’t move on your turn.

When the Patrol Deck is low, look through the discarded Pa-
trol cards to deduce where the Guard is likely to go next.

Dont be too afraid of Alarms - just get out of the way!

Card Reference
Not all cards are included here.

Characters

Acrobat (Climb Window ability): When you are on a tile
with an empty space adjacent to it (including outer walls or
the empty space in the Fort Knox layout), you may spend 3
actions to Move to a corresponding tile on the floor imme-
diately above or below your current tile. Your actions end
after you use this ability.

Hacker (Jammer ability): You and other players on your
tile do not trigger Alarms from Fingerprint, Laser, or Mo- -
tion tiles. This ability is not optional, so you cannot choose
to trigger these Alarms.

\
Advanced Wall Layouts

Instead of using the diagrams in the setup instructions, ex-
perienced players can make custom wall layouts to make the
game more difficult. To make a custom wall layout:

- Place an equal number of Walls on each floor:

Easy: 2 floors of 16 tiles with 8 Walls on each floor
Medium: 3 floors of 16 tiles with 8 Walls on each floor
Hard: 2 floors of 24 tiles with 12 Walls on each floor

- Wall pieces should be between tiles, not on the outside of
the floors.

- No tile or tiles should be completely blocked off.

- For a greater challenge, create choke points or long hall-
ways with dead ends.

Mini Expansion: Lost Visual

The optional “Lost Visual” Patrol cards make the Guard’s pa-
trols more unpredictable. In the heat of the moment, the Bur-
gle Bros. may lose track of the Guard’s location and be caught
by surprise...

1. When you set up the Guards, shuffle 1 Lost Visual card
into each Patrol deck.

2. When you draw a Lost Visual card the Guard stops moving
and is removed from the building. The next time that Guard
would move, draw the next Patrol card and place the Guard
in the tile indicated there. Draw another Patrol card to deter-
mine the Guard’s destination, as normal. Move the Guard to
the new destination, as normal.

If you trigger another Alarm (in another tile), place an Alarm token
in that tile, but always keep the floor’s Guard die with the closest
Alarm token to the Guard. In other words, the Guard will always
move toward the closest Alarm first. If Alarms are equally close, the
players choose which Alarm the Guard moves toward first.

When the Guard enters a tile with an Alarm, the Alarm token
is removed because the Guard deactivates the Alarm. After the
Guard removes all Alarm tokens from the floor, reveal a new
Patrol card to set the Guard’s next destination as normal.

Speeding up: When you would draw a card from the Patrol deck
but the Patrol deck is empty:

1. Shuffle that floor’s discard pile to form a new Patrol deck
(including any Patrol cards you discarded previously, if you're
playing with fewer than 4 players).

2. If playing with fewer than 4 players discard the appropriate num-
ber of cards for your player count.

3. Rotate that floor’s Guard die to permanently increase the
Guard’s movement speed by 1 (to a maximum of 6).

4, Reveal a new Patrol card to set the Guard’s next destination
as normal.

Ending the Game

Winning: Once you have cracked all the safes and have all the
Loot, you can Move from the top floor’s Stairs to get to the roof.
After you escape from the top floor, you don’t take any more
turns. When all the players have escaped, the Burgle Bros. have
successfully completed this heist--you win!

Losing: You lose when you don’t have any Stealth tokens and
something happens that makes you discard a Stealth token. You
discard Stealth tokens when a Guard enters the tile your Charac-
ter is in or when you enter a tile that a Guard is in. Other Events
and Loot can also cause you to discard Stealth tokens.

When you don't have a Stealth token but you have to discard one,
you can no longer hide: you’re arrested by the Guards! You give
up the identities of the Burgle Bros., and your team loses.
