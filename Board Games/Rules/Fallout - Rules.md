## SETUP

Choose a scenario sheet. Separately shuffle the and
map tiles, then construct the map according to the image
on the back of the sheet, placing a random tile of the correct
type in the corresponding places.

Create piles of S.P.E.C.I.A.L., caps, trait, and enemy tokens.
Turn facedown and randomize the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tokens and
each type of enemy token, and separate the enemy tokens
into individual stacks by type.

Divide all the encounter cards with a star in the upper-left
corner (instead of a number) into 2 different decks based on
their card backs. Shuffle these and set them facedown.

Remove any cards from the agenda deck with a number in
the bottom-left corner greater than the current number of
players. Then, separately shuffle the agenda, loot, and asset
cards and set them facedown. Place the card library, perk
cards, unique asset cards, and V.A.T.S. dice within reach
of all players.

Deal 4 asset cards faceup in a row near the map to form
the shop.

Randomly choose a first player and move the agenda
deck to their right side. Starting with that player and going
clockwise, each player chooses a survivor and takes the
corresponding figure, character card, and S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
token marked with that character’s silhouette. Place your
figure in an unoccupied space on the Crossroads Camp
map tile.

Each player takes a player board and places a green peg
in the 0 hole, a red peg in the 16 hole, and a gray peg in
the hole to the left of the XP track. Also place your starting
S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token in its corresponding slot on the player
board, then draw 1 additional S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token at random
and place it in its slot. If you already have that one, randomly
draw a different one instead.

Each player draws 1 agenda card, keeping it secret, and
takes 3 caps from the supply.

Resolve any effects on the scenario sheet or other
components that resolve at the start of the game. If any
enemy tokens are displayed on the map, place 1 random
enemy token of the corresponding type faceup in each of
those spaces.

Place the and power tokens on the topmost space of
the power track on the scenario sheet.

## GAME ROUND

Take turns in clockwise order, starting with the first player.
After all players have taken a turn, enemies on the map
activate and attack, and then a new round begins with the
first player taking another turn.

During your turn, you may perform up to 2 actions, and
may perform the same action (except the encounter action)
multiple times. You can can skip one or both of the actions
if desired.

## EXPLORE ACTION

```
Perform an explore action when you are in a space that
is adjacent to a facedown map tile to flip that tile faceup.
Orient the tile with the arrow pointing in the same direction
as the arrow on the starting tile.
```
```
For each enemy icon on the tile, draw a random enemy of
the matching type and place it faceup in the space with
the icon.
```
```
If there were any enemies on the tile when it was facedown,
place those enemies in the spaces of your choice on the tile
after it is flipped faceup.
```
## MOVE ACTION

```
Take a move action to gain 2 movement points (MPs). Each
point can be spent to move your figure into an adjacent
space.
You can interrupt your move action to perform another
action. If you perform 2 move actions, you can combine the
MPs and spend them together.
```
```
Moving into a difficult terrain space (red border) requires
an additional MP. The 2 MPs used to enter the space don’t
need to come from the same action.
```
```
If you move into an irradiated terrain space (green border)
you suffer 1 rad.
```
## QUEST ACTION

```
You cannot perform the quest action while in the same
space as a faceup enemy.
```
```
Perform a quest action to attempt to complete a quest
objective. You can attempt to complete a quest only if
you meet the requirement after the.
Execute any listed instructions in the quest requirement.
If you succeed, you complete the objective.
If a quest instructs you to place a quest marker, take a pair
of matching quest marker tokens, place one on the map as
indicated and the other on the quest card. When the card is
trashed, discard both quest markers.
```
## ENCOUNTER ACTION

```
You cannot perform the encounter action while in the same
space as a faceup enemy.
```
```
Perform an encounter action when in a space marked with
an encounter icon (wasteland , settlement ,
or vaults ) to resolve an encounter card from the
matching deck. You can perform this action at each
encounter icon only once per turn.
```
```
The player to your right draws the encounter card and reads
the intro and the bold text next to each numbered arrow.
Then you choose one of the options and execute all the
instructions after that option.
If an option involves a task, attempt to perform the task.
Resolve the succeed result if you succeed at the task or kill
the enemy, and the fail result if you do not.
```
```
Some options have conditions that must be met in order to
choose that option.
```
```
If a bold text section starts with FORCED, and the following
condition is met, instead of being allowed to choose an
option you must resolve that section. You cannot choose to
resolve that section if the condition is not met.
```
```
If an encounter is not trashed after being resolved, return it
to the bottom of the corresponding deck.
When resolving an encounter at a location with a level, treat
any instances of the encounter icon on the card as a number
equal to the level of the card’s encounter icon.
```
```
Encounters at vault spaces cannot be performed until the
corresponding deck is added to the game.
```
## FIGHT ACTION

```
When in a space with an active enemy, perform a fight action
to fight that enemy.
```
```
If multiple enemies are in your space, choose one.
```
```
If your equipped weapon has the ranged icon, you can
perform this action to fight an enemy in an adjacent space.
If that enemy does not have the icon, you inflict 1
additional hit.
```
```
Resolve the following steps:
```
1. Roll the 3 V.A.T.S. dice.
2. Reroll dice: For each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token on your weapon
    that matches a token that you have, generate 1 reroll.
    You can then spend each reroll one at a time to reroll any
    number of the 3 V.A.T.S. dice.
3. Resolve enemy hits: For each hit shown on the dice,
    suffer damage equal to the level of the enemy, first

reducing the total number of by the armor value (^)
of all armor you have equipped.

4. Resolve survivor hits: Spend dice results to inflict hits.
    For each die result on which there is one or more filled-in
    (green) area that matches a filled-in (green) area on the
    enemy, you inflict 1.

```
If you inflict a number of hits equaling or exceeding the
enemy’s level, the enemy is killed.
```
5. Gain XP: If you killed the enemy, gain XP equal to the
    enemy’s level.

```
Regardless of whether you do or do not kill the enemy, the
fight is over.
```
```
When instructed to draw and fight an enemy, draw an enemy
of that type from the supply, fight it, and then discard the
enemy token. If doing this as part of a quest or encounter,
you succeed only if you kill the enemy.
```
```
Abilities with the during a fight timing can be used during
any step of a fight. Abilities with the before a fight timing
must be used before rolling V.A.T.S. dice.
```
```
Each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token on your equipped weapon counts
as tokens used for the fight for card abilities.
```
```
If cards give additional uses for rerolls, they must be used
during the Reroll Dice step of a fight unless otherwise stated.
```
```
When an enemy is killed, discard its token. Then draw a
new token of the same type is from the supply and place
it facedown in the space with a matching enemy icon that
is closest to the space from which the other enemy was
discarded. If there are several matching spaces, the first
player chooses which one.
```
```
If you are killed and the enemy isn’t, the enemy remains
active and in the space. Hits inflicted on an enemy do not
carry over from fight to fight.
```
## CAMP ACTION

```
You cannot perform the camp action while in the same
space as a faceup enemy.
```
```
You may do all of the following in any order: recover 3 HP,
unexhaust all of your exhausted cards, gain the Well Rested
trait, and trade with any other survivors in your space or an
adjacent space. All exhausted cards must be unexhausted.
```
```
To trade, exchange any number of items, companions,
agendas, and caps. Both parties must agree to the trade.
Promises may be traded, but they are not binding. Other
game elements such as traits, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tokens, perks,
or the Ghoul’s starting card cannot be traded. Agenda cards
involved in a trade can be shown to the other survivor before
a trade.
```
## END OF THE ROUND

```
After all players have taken their turns, reveal the top card of
the agenda deck, resolve the enemy icons shown along the
bottom of the card, then discard it. Ignore all the text.
```
```
From left to right, for each enemy icon, move each enemy
of that type 1 space toward the nearest survivor, ignoring
terrain. They can move across facedown map tiles, treating
them as a single space. If, before moving, that enemy is
either in the same space as a survivor or adjacent to a
survivor and has the icon, the enemy fights that survivor
instead.
If there is a tie for the closest survivor, the enemy moves
toward or attacks the survivor with the lowest HP. On a
further tie, choose the tied player that acts earlier in turn
order.
```
```
After all active enemies of a type have activated, flip all
inactive enemies of that type faceup.
```
```
Inactive enemies are facedown. You cannot look at, fight or
use an ability to target an inactive enemy, and they do not
stop you from performing actions in their space.
When an enemy fights a survivor, that survivor and the
enemy resolve a fight as if that survivor had performed a
fight action. If multiple enemies attack you, you choose the
order in which the attacks resolve.
```
## DRAWING THE LAST AGENDA CARD

```
When the last agenda card is drawn, shuffle the discards to
create the new agenda deck and pass it to the player to the
right of the first player. That player is now the first player.
Whose turn it is and whose turn is next does not change.
```
```
Finally, advance both faction tokens 1 space down the track
on the scenario sheet.
```
```
Play continues with the next player in turn order. The round
will end, and the next agenda card will be drawn, before the
new first player’s next turn.
```
## PERFORMING TESTS

```
To perform a test, roll the 3 V.A.T.S. dice and count the
number of hit icons. If the number equals or exceeds the
difficulty of the test, you succeed.
```
```
If you have any S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tokens that match those used
by the test, you can reroll any number of dice before the
final results of the test are resolved. You can perform 1 such
reroll for each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token that matches one used
by the test.
```

## ENEMY ABILITIES

Enemies may have fight ability icons on their token:

```
Aggressive: When this enemy moves into your space,
or you move into its space, you immediately fight it
(this fight is not an action). If there are multiple target
options, the enemy attacks the survivor with the
lowest HP. A survivor who moves into a space with
multiple enemies may choose the order in which they
fight them.
```
An enemy with this ability being placed or becoming
active in the same space as a survivor does not cause
a fight.

Armor: Requires 1 additional to kill.

```
Loot: When you kill this enemy, draw 1 loot card.
```
```
Radiation: When this enemy hits you for any amount
of damage, suffer rads equal to the enemy’s level.
```
```
Ranged: When this enemy activates, it can fight you
from an adjacent space. If it does this and you do not
have a weapon, add 1 to the result.
```
```
Retreat: If you fail to kill this enemy during a fight, the
enemy becomes inactive and is flipped facedown.
```
## HP AND RADS

When you suffer damage, move the red peg on your player
board a number of holes down the track equal to the
damage suffered.

When you suffer rads , move the green peg up the track a
number of holes equal to the rads suffered.

If your HP is ever equal to or lower than your rads, your turn
ends and you are killed. Place your figure in any space on
the Crossroads Camp map tile, discard all cards in your
inventory, keeping any equipped cards, and recover all HP
(move the red peg back to the highest number). When you
are killed, you do not recover rads.

After you recover your HP, if you are still killed because
your rads are in the highest hole, you lose the game and are
eliminated.

## QUEST CARD RESULTS

Resolve quest effects left to right, as follows:

Add ##: Retrieve the indicated card from the card library.
Then, take a number of cards equal to the number of players
from the top of the deck matching the retrieved card’s back.
Shuffle all the cards together and place them on top of the
matching deck.

Stage ##: Search the card library for the indicated card and
place it faceup in the play area with the other quests.

## XP: Gain the indicated amount of XP.

## Caps: Gain the indicated number of caps.

Become X: Take the trait token matching X.

, , or : Draw a card from the deck that has a
matching back. If the icon is followed by a number, draw that
number of cards.

Gain the X unique asset: Search through the unique asset
deck for the card specified by X and take it. If that asset has
already been taken, draw 1 unique asset at random.

```
Shop ##: Buy or sell the indicated number of items from the
shop.
```
```
+ or +: The faction corresponding to the icon shown
gains an amount of power equal to the number of + symbols
after the icon.
```
```
Trash: Return the card to the box. If the quest is not trashed, it
is left in the play area and can be completed again.
```
## INVENTORY AND EQUIPMENT

```
When you acquire an item or companion, place it in your
play area; it is now in your inventory.
```
```
You can have up to 3 assets in your inventory at the same
time. If you would ever acquire more cards, you must choose
and discard cards until you have only 3.
```
```
Additionally, you can have up to 3 cards equipped at a time:
1 apparel , 1 weapon , and 1 companion
placed in the slots on your player board.
```
```
Equipped cards do not count toward your inventory and
the text of unequipped items has no effect. You can change
which cards you have equipped when you acquire a new
card; at the start of your turn; or when you perform a camp
action.
```
```
Some cards must be exhausted to use their abilities: turn
the card 90º on its side. An exhausted card cannot be
exhausted again. When instructed to unexhaust a card, turn
it upright again. When a companion unexhausts, check the
condition on the bottom of its card. If you do not meet this
condition, it is discarded.
```
## SHOP

```
When performing an encounter at a settlement, you may get
the chance to sell items, buy items, or recruit companions
from the shop.
```
```
Drawn 1 card from the top of the asset deck and add it
to the shop. The encounter specifies the maximum number
of items you can buy and sell. Buy items by spending the
specified number of caps (you may need a specified token
or trait). Sell items by discarding from your inventory to the
appropriate discard pile and taking caps equal to 1 less than
the item’s cost.
```
```
When a card is added to the shop, place it on the left side
of the row. When a card is discarded from the shop, remove
the rightmost card. If the shop ever has more or fewer than
4 cards in it after an action, discard or draw asset cards to
reset the shop track to 4 cards.
```
```
When the asset deck is empty, shuffle the discards to form
a new deck.
```
## XP, LEVELING, AND PERKS

```
Each time you kill an enemy, gain XP equal to that enemy’s
level. Other game effects that grant XP specify the amount
gained.
```
```
The first time you earn an XP, place the grey XP peg in the
hole beneath the farthest left S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token you have.
```
```
Each time you earn XP, you move your XP peg to the next
S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token on your board. The number of times the
peg moves is equal to the XP you have earned. If the XP peg
moves beyond your last S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token, you level up.
Place the XP peg back into the far-left hole and start the
process over if you still have some remaining XP to gain.
```
```
When you level up, draw 2 random S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tokens and
choose one to keep.
If you do not already have that token, add it to your board. If
you already have that token, get a perk instead: return the
token to the supply and search the perk deck for the perks
that match that token, then choose 1 perk to keep.
```
```
If none match the chosen token, choose any perk showing a
token that matches a token you have; if none still match, you
do not gain a perk.
To use a perk card, discard it during your turn to gain the
effect. You cannot discard it while you are still in the middle
of performing an action, except for a move action.
```
## TRAITS

```
When you have a trait token, you cannot also have the trait
displayed on the opposite side.
```
```
Idolized/Vilified
```
```
Synth/Super Mutant
```
```
Well Rested/Addicted
```
```
When you gain a trait, take the corresponding token and
place it in one of the slots in the upper-right corner of your
board. If you already have that token turned to the other
side, flip it: you lose the trait on the other side. If the faceup
side of a trait token shows a lock icon, you cannot flip it and
do not gain the trait on the other side.
```
```
If you are ever instructed to lose a trait, you must discard
that token. You can lose a trait even if it has a lock icon.
```
```
When performing a test or fighting an enemy, you
can voluntarily lose the Well Rested trait to gain 1
reroll, rerolling any number of the dice.
```
## FACTIONS

```
The scenario sheet describes the 2 factions in the chosen
scenario. Faction tokens on the map represent the enemy
shown next to that faction on the scenario sheet.
```
```
When a faction’s icon is shown on the bottom of the agenda
card drawn for enemy activation, that faction’s enemy
tokens activate following the same rules as normal enemies.
If one of these enemies ever become inactive, the faction
token is discarded instead (and not replaced).
```
```
If an enemy on the scenario sheet shows an X or Y for
a value, that value is determined by the position of that
faction’s power token. The values of X and Y are shown to
the right of the power track.
```
```
Each faction’s current power is shown by the position of its
faction token on the track on the left side of the scenario
sheet. This can be advanced by players completing quests
and by the agenda deck being depleted. Its position affects
the value of certain agenda cards and can affect how
powerful the corresponding faction’s enemy tokens are.
```
```
A faction’s token can be advanced by the survivors
completing specific quests. Any quests that show the or
icons in their results advance that faction’s token down
the power track a number of spaces equal to the + symbols
shown after the icon. Additionally, when the agenda deck is
depleted, both factions advance 1 space down the track.
```
```
If a faction’s token ever reaches the final space of the track,
that faction has gained enough power to take over the
wasteland, and the game ends.
```
```
If that token advancing granted any survivors enough
influence to win the game, they can declare victory and end
the game first. If no survivor reached the required amount of
influence, the faction that reached the end wins the game,
and all survivors lose.
```
```
If the faction’s token would advance beyond the final space,
include the excess number of spaces it would advance when
totaling the number of spaces by which that faction exceeds
the other for the purpose of determining players’ influence
totals.
```
#### LOYALTY

```
At the start of your turn, you can reveal a or agenda
card from your hand and place it faceup in your play area
to declare loyalty to that faction for as long as that card
is faceup in your play area. Declaring loyalty to a faction
grants 3 effects:
Enemies from that faction in your space do not prohibit
you from performing any actions.
When enemies of that faction activate, they only move
toward and fight survivors not loyal to their faction.
You cannot fight enemies of that faction.
```
```
You can have only 1 agenda card revealed in this way.
```
```
If you reveal a new agenda card for loyalty, return the
previously revealed card to your hand. You may also pick up
a revealed agenda card at the start of your turn to withdraw
your loyalty.
```
## INFLUENCE AND WINNING

```
You can have a maximum of 4 agenda cards in your hand;
if you draw a fifth, choose one and shuffle it back into the
agenda deck. Agenda cards grant you influence.
```
```
When you reach the required amount of influence to win the
game, declare victory and reveal your agenda cards. That
survivor wins the game.
The amount of influence needed to win the game depends
on the number of players:
1 player: 11 influence
2 players: 10 influence
3 players: 9 influence
4 players: 8 influence
```
```
If multiple survivors reach the required amount of influence,
they share victory. All survivors that reach that amount of
influence share the victory, even if one has more influence.
```
## SOLO PLAY

```
Follow all the standard rules with the following exceptions:
```
```
When a quest requires you to be in the same space as
another survivor, you must be in a space instead. If it
requires the other survivor to make a test, they are assumed
to have a result of 3.
```
```
When resolving encounter cards, read only the text that
would normally be read aloud, and then make your decision
before reading the text for your chosen outcome.
```
```
When the agenda deck is depleted, advance only the power
token for the faction that currently has less power. If the
factions are tied for power, they both advance as normal.
```

## GAME ROUND

During your turn, you may perform up to 2 actions.

## EXPLORE ACTION

Flip an adjacent facedown map tile faceup. Draw and
place faceup enemies matching each enemy icon.

## MOVE ACTION

Gain 2 MPs. Each point can be spent to move your figure
into an adjacent space.

Moving into difficult terrain requires an additional MP. If
you move into irradiated terrain you suffer 1 rad.

## QUEST ACTION

You cannot perform the quest action while in the same
space as a faceup enemy.

Perform a quest action to attempt to complete a quest
objective if you meet the requirement. If you succeed,
you complete the objective.

## ENCOUNTER ACTION

You cannot perform the encounter action while in the
same space as a faceup enemy and can perform this
action at each encounter icon only once per turn.

Perform an encounter action when in a space marked
with an encounter icon (wasteland , settlement ,
or vaults ) to resolve an encounter card from the
matching deck.

The player to your right draws the encounter card and
reads the intro and the bold text next to each numbered
arrow. Then you choose and execute one of the options.

When resolving an encounter at a location with a level,
treat any instances of the encounter icon on the card as a
number equal to the level of the card’s encounter icon.

## FIGHT ACTION

When in a space with an active enemy, perform a fight
action to fight that enemy. If multiple enemies are in your
space, choose one.

If your equipped weapon has the icon, you can
perform this action to fight an enemy in an adjacent
space. If that enemy does not have the icon, you
inflict 1 additional.

1. Roll the 3 V.A.T.S. dice.
2. Reroll dice: For each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token on your
    weapon that matches a token that you have, generate
    1 reroll. You can then spend each reroll one at a time to
    reroll any number of the 3 V.A.T.S. dice.
3. Resolve enemy hits: For each shown on the dice,
    suffer damage equal to the level of the enemy (reduce
    the total by your equipped armor.
       4. Resolve survivor hits: For each die result on which
          there is one or more green area that matches a green)
          area on the enemy, inflict 1. If you inflict hits
          equaling or exceeding the enemy’s level, it is killed.
       5. Gain XP: If you killed the enemy, gain XP equal to its
          level. Then draw a new token of the same type from
          the supply and place it facedown in the space with a
          matching enemy icon that is closest to the space from
          which the other enemy was discarded.

## CAMP ACTION

```
You cannot perform the camp action while in the same
space as a faceup enemy.
```
```
You may do all of the following in any order: recover 3
HP, unexhaust all of your exhausted cards, gain the Well
Rested trait, and trade with any other survivors in your
space or an adjacent space.
```
## END OF THE ROUND

```
After all players have taken turns, reveal the top agenda
card, resolve the enemy icons left to right, then discard it.
```
```
Move each enemy of that type 1 space toward the nearest
survivor, ignoring terrain. If, before moving, that enemy is
in the same space or adjacent to a survivor and has the
icon, the enemy fights that survivor instead.
```
```
After all active enemies of a type have activated, flip all
inactive enemies of that type faceup.
```
## DRAWING THE LAST AGENDA CARD

```
When the last agenda card is drawn, shuffle the discards

first player. That player is now the first player.
```
```
Finally, advance both faction tokens 1 space down the
track on the scenario sheet.
```
## PERFORMING TESTS

```
Roll the 3 V.A.T.S. dice. If the number of equals
or exceeds the difficulty of the test, you succeed. You
can perform 1 reroll for each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token that
matches one used by the test.
```
```
When performing a test or fighting an enemy,
you can voluntarily lose the Well Rested trait to
gain 1 reroll, rerolling any number of the dice.
```
## ENEMY ABILITIES

```
Aggressive: When this enemy moves into your
space, or you move into its space, you immediately
fight it (this fight is not an action).
```
```
Armor: Requires 1 additional to kill.
Loot: When you kill this enemy, draw 1 loot card.
```
```
Radiation: When this enemy hits you for any
amount of damage, suffer rads equal to its level.
```
```
Ranged: When this enemy activates, it can fight you
from an adjacent space. If it does this and you do
not have a weapon, add 1 to the result.
```
```
Retreat: If you fail to kill this enemy in a fight, the
enemy becomes inactive and is flipped facedown.
```
## GAME ROUND

```
During your turn, you may perform up to 2 actions.
```
## EXPLORE ACTION

```
Flip an adjacent facedown map tile faceup. Draw and
place faceup enemies matching each enemy icon.
```
## MOVE ACTION

```
Gain 2 MPs. Each point can be spent to move your figure
into an adjacent space.
```
```
Moving into difficult terrain requires an additional MP. If
you move into irradiated terrain you suffer 1 rad.
```
## QUEST ACTION

```
You cannot perform the quest action while in the same
space as a faceup enemy.
```
```
Perform a quest action to attempt to complete a quest
objective if you meet the requirement. If you succeed,
you complete the objective.
```
## ENCOUNTER ACTION

```
You cannot perform the encounter action while in the
same space as a faceup enemy and can perform this
action at each encounter icon only once per turn.
```
```
Perform an encounter action when in a space marked
with an encounter icon (wasteland , settlement ,
or vaults ) to resolve an encounter card from the
matching deck.
```
```
The player to your right draws the encounter card and
reads the intro and the bold text next to each numbered
arrow. Then you choose and execute one of the options.
```
```
When resolving an encounter at a location with a level,
treat any instances of the encounter icon on the card as a
number equal to the level of the card’s encounter icon.
```
## FIGHT ACTION

```
When in a space with an active enemy, perform a fight
action to fight that enemy. If multiple enemies are in your
space, choose one.
```
```
If your equipped weapon has the icon, you can
perform this action to fight an enemy in an adjacent
space. If that enemy does not have the icon, you
inflict 1 additional.
```
1. Roll the 3 V.A.T.S. dice.
2. Reroll dice: For each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token on your
    weapon that matches a token that you have, generate
    1 reroll. You can then spend each reroll one at a time to
    reroll any number of the 3 V.A.T.S. dice.
3. Resolve enemy hits: For each shown on the dice,
    suffer damage equal to the level of the enemy (reduce
    the total by your equipped armor.
       4. Resolve survivor hits: For each die result on which
          there is one or more green area that matches a green)
          area on the enemy, inflict 1. If you inflict hits
          equaling or exceeding the enemy’s level, it is killed.
       5. Gain XP: If you killed the enemy, gain XP equal to its
          level. Then draw a new token of the same type from
          the supply and place it facedown in the space with a
          matching enemy icon that is closest to the space from
          which the other enemy was discarded.

## CAMP ACTION

```
You cannot perform the camp action while in the same
space as a faceup enemy.
```
```
You may do all of the following in any order: recover 3
HP, unexhaust all of your exhausted cards, gain the Well
Rested trait, and trade with any other survivors in your
space or an adjacent space.
```
## END OF THE ROUND

```
After all players have taken turns, reveal the top agenda
card, resolve the enemy icons left to right, then discard it.
```
```
Move each enemy of that type 1 space toward the nearest
survivor, ignoring terrain. If, before moving, that enemy is
in the same space or adjacent to a survivor and has the
icon, the enemy fights that survivor instead.
```
```
After all active enemies of a type have activated, flip all
inactive enemies of that type faceup.
```
## DRAWING THE LAST AGENDA CARD

```
When the last agenda card is drawn, shuffle the discards
into a new deck and pass it to the player to the right of the

## ATOMIC BONDS EXPANSION

## SETUP

After performing the base game’s setup steps:

Choose loyal faction: Choose 1 of the factions on a scenario
sheet to be the loyal faction. Replace that scenario sheet
with the identically named scenario sheet from this
expansion, loyal faction’s side faceup.

Then place the new double-sided power token (non-loyal
faction’s power symbol faceup) on the topmost space of the
power track. Power tokens from the base game are not used.

Create new decks: Shuffle the modification, mutation,
workshop upgrade, and goal cards into separate decks and
place them facedown.

Then, shuffle the activation deck and place it to the right
side of the first player. The agenda deck from the base game
is not used.

Reveal goal cards: Reveal 4 goal cards and place them
faceup in the play area.

Place C.A.M.P. token: Place 1 C.A.M.P. token on the
Crossroads Camp space of the starting map tile. Place all
other C.A.M.P. tokens in a pile to the side of the play area.

Prepare mutations: Deal 1 mutation card facedown to each
survivor, who places it in the slot on the right side of their
survivor board. A survivor’s mutation remains facedown and
they cannot look at it until it is revealed during the game.

## PLAYING THE GAME

#### FACTIONS

Because the loyal faction is not represented on the power
track, if a quest reward would advance that faction’s power
token, resolve the + effect for that faction on the scenario
sheet instead.

The non-loyal faction on the scenario sheet is the opposing
faction, and they advance on the power track when it is
activated at the end of a round. If it reaches the final space,
the game ends and the survivors lose.

#### ACTIVATION CARDS

Activation cards replace agenda cards and are used to
activate enemies and the opposing faction.

At the end of the round, after all survivors have taken their
turns, the first player reveals the top card of the activation
deck and performs these steps:

1. Activate enemies
Each activation card indicates 2 of the 5 standard enemy
types to activate, top to bottom, following the normal rules
for activation.
2. Activate opposing faction
Some activation cards include or icons. After
activating enemies, if the card has a faction icon that
matches the loyal faction, the survivors ignore that icon.

```
If the card has a faction icon that matches the opposing
faction, the survivors activate that faction’s enemies and
advance the opposing faction’s power token by 1 space.
```
```
Additionally, the survivors check to see how many enemies
of the opposing faction are already on the map and resolve
the Activation effect on the scenario sheet that matches
that number.
```
3. Choose first player
The first player can choose to remain first player or choose
another survivor; if a new first player is chosen, that player
places the activation deck and its discard pile to the right of
their play area.

## ENDING THE GAME

```
The survivors either win together by completing the Victory
conditions presented on the scenario sheet, or they lose
together when the opposing faction’s power token reaches
the last space on the power track.
```
```
Each scenario’s victory condition requires the survivors to
complete goals. Survivors can complete a goal immediately
when the condition specified on the goal card is satisfied.
When a goal is completed, flip that goal facedown.
```
```
If there are 2 identical goals, the condition on each of them
must be completed independently. If a goal is completed
and the number of required goals has already been reached,
retreat the opposing faction’s power token by 2 spaces.
```
## ADDITIONAL RULES

#### ASSISTING

```
A survivor can assist during a fight if they are either in the
same space as the survivor who is fighting or if they have
a ranged weapon and are in a space adjacent to the
survivor who is fighting.
```
```
To assist, a survivor rolls the green assist die. Any hits on the
assist die are combined with the hits from the other V.A.T.S.
dice results. The assisting survivor can use traits and
abilities (such as their equipped weapon) to reroll the assist
die and affect the fight in other ways as if they were fighting.
If an enemy is killed while a survivor is being assisted, the
assisting survivor gains 1 XP. However the assisting survivor
suffers an amount of damage equal to the enemy’s level for
each icon showing on the assist die. Only 1 survivor can
assist per fight.
```
#### C.A.M.P. TOKENS

```
If the survivors gain a C.A.M.P. token, they take one from the
supply and place it near their scenario sheet.
```
```
When a survivor performs a camp action, if they are in a
named space, they can take a C.A.M.P. token they have
gained that is not already on the map and place it in their
space. That space is now available as a fast-travel destination.
```
#### FAST TRAVEL ACTION

```
During a survivor’s turn, as long as there are no faceup
enemies in their space or an adjacent space, a survivor can
perform a fast-travel action as one of their 2 actions.
To do so, a survivor places their figure on any space that
contains a C.A.M.P. token.
```
#### KILLED

```
If a survivor is killed, advance the opposing faction’s power
track by 1 space.
```
#### MODIFICATIONS

```
Modifications provide enhanced capability to weapons and
apparel.
When a survivor is shopping, they can use one or more
of their shop actions to draw an equal number of cards
from the modification deck. Then, they can take 1 card of
their choice from among those they drew, discarding the
remaining cards.
```
```
When a survivor acquires a modification, they can attach it
to one of their assets that has a matching icon.
```
```
Each asset can have 1 modification attached to it.
```
```
A survivor can replace an existing modification with a new
one, but they must discard the modification that is being
replaced—they cannot move it to a different asset. If an
asset is discarded, the modification attached to it is also
discarded.
```
```
Modifications attached to assets in a survivor’s inventory do
not count against their inventory limit.
```
#### MUTATIONS

```
Mutations provide survivors with both positive and negative
abilities after they have reached 5 rads. If a survivor’s green
peg reaches the fifth hole on their survivor board track, they
immediately activate their mutation by flipping it faceup and
reading it aloud. The abilities on their mutation are in effect
for the duration of the game, even if that survivor recovers
rads so that they are below 5.
```
#### WORKSHOP UPGRADES

```
Quests may reward survivors with workshop upgrades,
represented by the icon (formerly the agenda icon). If a
survivor gains one, they draw a workshop upgrade card from
the workshop upgrade deck and follow its instructions.
```
```
After a survivor resolves a workshop upgrade card, they
place it near the scenario sheet. Some effects may reference
the number of workshop upgrades the survivors have gained.
```
## NEW CALIFORNIA EXPANSION

## SETUP

```
Expand any scenario by adding the new asset, loot, unique
asset, and perk cards into their respective decks, and the
faction, enemy, and quest marker tokens with those from
the base game.
The 5 new survivors can be used in any scenario. When
playing as Mister Handy, take both of his character cards.
The encounter and quest cards can also be combined with
their base-game counterparts, but you may wish to keep the
new cards separate to make it easier to find specific cards
while playing the new scenarios.
```
```
The 12 new map tiles are used with the base game tiles
to create the maps for the 2 new scenarios and for the
4 expanded scenarios. When playing the non-expanded
scenarios from the base game, do not use any of the map
tiles from the expansion.
```
## ADDITIONAL RULES

#### CARDS

```
If a game effect references a card number preceded by a
icon, this means that there are multiple unique copies of
that card and that you should use only one of them.
```
#### TESTS

```
If you are instructed to perform a test with no specific
difficulty number, you want to get as many results as
possible. You will be instructed how to resolve the test based
on the number of hits rolled.
```
#### GROUP XP

```
When any player gains a Group XP reward, each survivor
gains the indicated amount of XP.
```
#### ENEMY ABILITIES

```
Fast: When this enemy moves, it moves up to 2 spaces
toward the nearest survivor instead of 1.
```
```
Caps: After a survivor kills an enemy, that survivor
gains caps equal to the enemy’s level.
```
## NEW CALIFORNIA RULES

#### SETUP

```
During setup of the New California scenario, players do not
draw agenda cards and influence is not used to win the
game.
```
```
Additionally, all of the agenda cards are used to create the
agenda deck for this scenario, regardless of player count.
```
#### VICTORY AND LOSS

```
Victory and loss conditions are different from the standard
game. Survivors do not win or lose individually. Instead, the
survivors as a group win when the power token reaches
the final space of the power track.
Conversely, the survivors as a group lose when the power
token reaches the final space of the power track.
Survivors move these tokens back and forth along the power
track by gaining agendas and completing the main scenario
quest.
```
#### KILLED

```
When any survivor is killed, advance the power token 1
space toward the final space of the power track in addition
to the other effects of a survivor being killed.
```
#### END OF THE ROUND

```
When the final agenda card is drawn and the agenda deck
is reshuffled, the power token is not advanced. The
power token is still advanced as normal.
```
#### AGENDAS

```
When a survivor gains an agenda, it is immediately
discarded and one of the following effects is resolved based
on the name of the agenda card:
Freedom ( ) agendas: Advance the power token 1
space toward the final space of the power track.
Security ( ) agendas: Move the power token 1 space
toward the first space of the power track.
Other agendas: The survivor who discarded the agenda
chooses to resolve either of the effects listed above.
```
