# Stronghold 2e

## Brief Summary
Stronghold is a two-player asymmetric siege warfare game. One player defends a fortress while the other commands an invading army. The game revolves around resource management, tactical positioning, and strategic decision-making as the invader attempts to breach the walls within 7 rounds while the defender tries to hold out.

# Stronghold - Rules

#### SETUP

One player is the defender and the other is the invader.
The defender sits behind the stronghold.

#### INVADER SETUP

Place all of your units in the bag. Place the phase 1 and phase 6
action cards faceup on the table, then shuffle each set of phase
2, 3, 4 and 5 cards separately and randomly draw 3 cards from
each set. Place all the phase 2 and 3 cards, along with the phase 1
and 6 cards, in a line in ascending numerical order (phase 1 at the
far left and phase 6 at the far right). You may place multiple cards
with the same number in any order.

Place the drawn phase 4 and 5 cards facedown in an action card
supply (these are open information) and remove all unused action
cards from the game.

Place 1 white, 3 green and 1 red units on each foreground space.
Place 1 white and 1 green unit on the marauders space.

Shuffle the objective cards, draw 3, choose 2 of them and place
them faceup near you. Remove unused cards from the game.

Take 5 wood tokens into your supply and place the remaining
ones aside to form a wood supply pile.

Place the machine hit and miss cards near the board.

#### DEFENDER SETUP

Place the appropriate units on each wall section: each space with
a colored mark receives 1 unit of the corresponding type. Also
place 2 wall components on each wall section.

Place the building tiles in the stronghold in any arrangement you
like (be sure not to cover important spaces on the wall sections).

Place 1 marksman in the Guard House. Place 3 marksmen, 1
soldier and 1 veteran in the Barracks. All remaining units are
placed next to the board.

Place the heroes on the appropriate wall sections. Place the
heroic order tiles next to the board.

Shuffle the defense plan cards, draw 3, then choose 2 of them
and place them facedown near you. Remove the unused cards
from the game.

Place the defender hit cards in a pile near the board.

The defender takes 4 hourglasses to use after the first invader
action of the first round. Place the remaining hourglass tokens
next to the board.

Place the round token on the first space of the round track. Place
the remaining markers and tokens near the board.

At the start of every round the defender receives 2 hourglasses
to use after the first invader action. Therefore the defender starts
the game with 6 hourglasses.

#### THE INVADER

Your goal is to breach at least 1 wall section before the end of the
seventh round.

```
Goblin (Strength 1) Orc (Strength 2) Troll (Strength 3)
```
## ACTIONS

The action cards define your available abilities and must be
resolved from left to right in ascending order. You may perform all,
some, or none of these actions, but you must have the required
amount of resources (units and wood) available in your supply
to pay for every action used. Place these resources on the action
card to mark that it has been used.

```
If you do not have enough resources available to pay for an action,
you cannot take that action. Units already on the board may not
be used to pay for actions.
```
```
Each action may only be performed once per round and only in
order from left to right. Once an action has been used or skipped
over, you cannot perform that action again this round.
The defender receives 1 hourglass for every unit you spend. If an
hourglass is shown in the cost, this is an additional requirement to
pay the defender that number of hourglasses.
```
```
After you perform an action, the defender must spend all the
hourglasses in their supply (if any). After the defender spends all
their hourglasses, you proceed with your next action.
```
```
The game continues back and forth in this manner through all 9
action cards, and then the assault commences. After the seventh
round, the game ends.
```
## OBJECTIVES

```
Each objective has a goal and a benefit; when the goal is met, you
must resolve the benefit.
```
```
Blood Magic, Not A Single Stone, and Devoted Warlocks remain in
play once they are fulfilled. All other objectives are discarded.
```
#### INVADER ACTIONS

## PHASE 1: SUPPLIES

#### BRIEFING Randomly draw 14 units from the bag and place them in

```
your supply. Add to them 5 wood from the wood supply pile.
```
```
Then, at a one-off cost of 1 hourglass, you may exchange any
number of action phase cards with those available in your supply.
Phase 1 and 6 cards may never be exchanged. Cards of the same
phase number may be rearranged by taking this action.
During the first round, you may only exchange the phase 2 and 3
action cards with the phase 4 and 5 cards that were drawn and
make up your supply of action cards.
```
#### RESOURCES You may, at a cost of 1 hourglass:

```
Discard 1 goblin to gain 1 or
Discard 1 orc to gain 2 or
Discard 1 troll to gain 3.
You can acquire up to 8 wood per round (5 for Briefing, plus 3
if a troll is used for Resources).
```
## PHASE 2: SIEGE MACHINES

```
When built, place the corresponding machine tile on an
appropriate space of your choice.
```
```
The Ballista, Catapult, and Trebuchet are barrage weapons. When
built, shuffle together a machine card deck of 2 hit and 4 miss
cards and place it facedown on the machine tile. You can have a
maximum of 4 barrage weapons on the board.
```

```
connected by paths to this rampart. Kills 1 defender and 1 invader
unit on the target wall section.
```
#### CATAPULT Location: Rampart. Effect: May fire at any wall section

```
connected by paths to this rampart. Destroys 1 wall component
on the chosen wall section. If there are none, destroy a cauldron
instead. If there are no cauldrons, target the tower (removing a
Cannon/Pole/Bay Window placed there).
```
#### MANTELET Location: Rampart. Effect: Marksmen attacks on this

```
rampart have no effect. Mantelets do not protect units from
cannons and the Sharpshooter action.
```
#### SIEGE TOWER Location: Foreground. Siege towers move towards

```
the walls like any other unit. Effect: Wall components and
cauldrons are not resolved during a combat where the siege
tower is present.
```
```
Trebuchet Location: Foreground. Effect: May fire at any wall
section on the same side of the stronghold. Destroys 1 wall
component on the chosen wall section. If there are none, destroy
a cauldron instead. If there are no cauldrons, target the tower
(removing a Cannon/Pole/Bay Window placed there).
```
## PHASE 3: EQUIPMENT

```
Each wall section may hold a maximum of 2 different equipment
tokens, 1 on each given space.
```
#### BANNER Location: Wall section.

```
#### SAP Location: Wall section.

```
Effect: During the maneuver phase, you may move 1 goblin
or 1 orc from your supply to this section.
```
## PHASE 4: TRAINING

```
Up to 2 different training tokens may be present at each rampart
on the given spaces (this does not apply to the Artilleryman,
Trainer and Saboteur trainings).
```
#### ARTILLERYMAN Effect: Remove 1 miss card from any

```
machine card pile and reshuffle. You may train artillery-men
for the same siege machine in subsequent rounds.
```
#### QUARTERMASTER Location: Rampart.

```

this rampart and proceed directly to the walls.
```
#### SABOTEUR Location: Building.

```
## PHASE 5: RITUALS

```
Each ritual has 1 target token and 2 bluff tokens. Each time a
ritual is selected, place up to 3 corresponding tokens on up to 3
different spaces facedown as required by the ritual. The defender
does not know which space is the true target.
Rituals trigger when the action/space they are on is used. Flip the
token: discard a bluff to your supply. Target means the ritual is
resolved; keep the token on the board until the end of the round.
When the round ends, return all ritual tokens to your supply.
A ritual may be paid for and performed again in future rounds.
```
#### BLOODSTONES Location: Barrage siege machines (Ballista,

```
Catapult, and Trebuchet). Effect: When the target siege
machine hits a wall, kill +1 defender unit of your choice.
```
#### DEMON Location: Buildings. Effect: When the defender

```
#### GALE Location: Wall sections. Effect: Sending defender units

```
or heroes to or from this wall section costs +1 hourglass.
```
#### POSSESSION Location: Unused hero order tokens. Effect: When

```
the target hero order is activated, remove the order from the
game without resolving it.
```
#### SPECTER Location: Wall sections. Effect: Defender units killed

```
at the wall section are placed on the foregrounds as invader
units of equal strength (replace them with previously
discarded invader units).
```
## PHASE 6: MANEUVER AND ORDERS

```
All remaining units you have not used in previous actions may be
sent to attack the stronghold. Any invader units which are on the
walls may be issued orders. Unused units remain in the supply.
```
#### MANEUVERS

```
You have 2 maneuver actions: minor and major. At least 1 of
the maneuvers has to be performed each round.
You may perform either maneuver, or both in any order, but may
only perform each maneuver action once. Each has to be taken
one at a time.
```
```
You may move any mix of units from both foregrounds, all the
ramparts, as well as from the supply. Units can only move along
the paths on the board. Units may only move to a location if there
is a space available.
```
```
Each foreground may hold a maximum of 10 invader units. Each
rampart may hold a maximum of 7 invader units. Units may not
enter a foreground or rampart which is full.
```
```
The defender receives hourglasses for phase 6 actions after all
maneuvers are complete and orders are given (not separately after
minor and then major maneuver actions).
```
```
You may not withdraw units from the walls.
```
#### MINOR MANEUVER Effect: You may move up to 5 units from

```
each rampart to attached wall sections, and 5 units from each
foreground to connected ramparts.
```
```
Additionally, up to 5 units may be moved from the supply to each
foreground, for a total of 10 new units on the board.
```
#### MAJOR MANEUVER Effect: You may move up to 7 units from

```
each rampart to attached wall sections, and 7 units from each
foreground to connected ramparts.
```
```
Additionally, up to 7 units may be moved from the supply to each
foreground, for a total of 14 new units on the board.
```
```
Move units in the following order:
```
1. Sap units to the walls
2. Ramparts to the walls
3. Foreground to the ramparts
4. Supply to the foregrounds

```
The board paths on the bottom right side of the stronghold
(defender’s view) require units to move through 1 rampart before
reaching the outermost rampart. Your units move first from the
outermost rampart to a connected wall section, then new units
from the previous rampart may move there.
```
```
On the right side of the stronghold (defender’s view), there is a
marauders space between the final 2 ramparts. During both the
minor and major maneuvers, if you move any unit to the final
rampart, add the 1 goblin and 1 orc marauders to the last rampart
as a bonus, then replace them on the marauders space with the
same units from the bag.
```
#### ORDERS

```
You may now give orders to units at wall sections. If possible, at
least 1 invader unit must carry out the given order. If all units die
at a wall section with an order present, remove the order from the
game without resolving its effect.
Place order tokens at the chosen wall section in such a way that
there are no doubts which wall section they affect.
```
```
Only one of these 2 ways of issuing orders may be used each
turn:
```
#### OPEN ORDER Cost: None. Effect: Place 1 order token faceup at a

```
chosen wall section.
```
#### CLASSIFIED ORDER Cost: 1 hourglass. Effect: Place any number of

```
order tokens facedown and flip them faceup during the assault.
Only 1 order counter may be placed on each wall section.
```

#### GOBLIN FURY Effect: The strength of each goblin at

this wall section is 3. After the assault all goblins
here are killed. If the strength of the goblins is enough to win
the combat and break into the stronghold, they will do so even
if there are no other invader units on that wall section.

If the defender has the advantage on the wall in combat, the
affected goblins are removed from the board before your losses
are calculated.

#### ORC DETONATION Effect: At least 1 of the orcs detonate.

Remove any number of orcs at this wall section.
Each orc removed destroys 1 wall component at this wall section.
Detonated orcs are removed from the board before the assault
is resolved.

#### CALL OF THE TROLLS Effect: If you have a troll at this

wall section, order another troll on this side of the
stronghold to maneuver. This troll must immediately move 1
step towards the wall section where the order has been given.
The Troll Trap affects the extra troll as normal.

#### BLUFF COUNTER Effect: Used to mislead the defender.

```
It does not modify any unit attributes or actions.
```
#### THE DEFENDER

Your goal is to keep the invader from breaching the stronghold
for 7 turns.

```
Marksman (Str 1) Soldier (Str 2) Veteran (Str 3)
```
After each invader action, you must spend all the hourglasses in
your supply, placing them in the spaces next to the appropriate
action.

Placing an hourglass on an action’s last free space activates that
action.

When all the hourglasses are spent, the invader takes their next
action. If you receive no hourglasses, the invader starts the next
action immediately.

## MOVEMENT

You may move any number of units each turn. Discard the
hourglasses used to pay for movement actions.

#### MOVE UNITS AND HEROES Cost: 1 hourglass per move.

Effect: Any unit or hero can be moved to any free adjacent space.
Wall sections on either side of a tower are adjacent, and wall
sections are adjacent to the towers between them. The Barracks,
Guards, and the Courtyard are adjacent to all spaces.

The 2 wall sections adjacent to the front gate are not adjacent.

Only marksmen may move into the towers and each tower may
only hold 2 marksmen.

You cannot move units to the Forge, the Workshop, the Scouts, the
Hospital or the Cathedral.

Heroes may only move on wall sections and to/from the Courtyard.

You may move any number of units each turn, and individual units
may move multiple times. Discard the hourglasses used to pay for
movement actions.

#### SWAP SPACES Cost: 1 hourglass per swap. Effect: Instead of moving

to a free space, a unit may swap places with another unit in an
adjacent space. Heroes may also swap spaces in this manner.

## DEFENSE PLANS

At any time during the game, you may choose to use the defense
plans chosen at the start of the game.

Once used, all defense plans have a negative section that affects
you in different ways.

Most defense plans are retained for the rest of the game and
continue to impact you.

## HEROES

```
The Warrior (Strength 2) and Officer (Strength 3) heroes
affect their wall sections differently.
```
```
They cannot be killed and are not considered units.
```
```
Each may also perform 1 heroic order per turn; these do not cost
hourglasses and may be used during any defender phase.Each
heroic order may only be used once per turn.
```
- Move 1 unit from the Courtyard to a wall section where a hero
    is present.
- Move any unit to any building (except for the Guards and the
    Barracks) and gain 1 hourglass to use on the chosen building.
- Move 1 unit from any wall section, on the same side of the
    stronghold as the hero, to the Courtyard.

#### DEFENDER ACTIONS

```
You do not need all the hourglasses necessary to complete a
specific action at one time; they may be built up over a series of
defender phases or rounds.
Each action may only be performed once per turn unless
otherwise noted.
After the round is over, remove all hourglasses used on completed
actions.
```
```
If there is a Saboteur token on a building, it increases the cost of
the actions in that building by 1 hourglass. Place the additional
hourglass on the building tile’s red hourglass space.
```
```
Each tower may only have 1 cannon, pole, or bay window.
```
## BARRACKS

#### TRAIN TROOPS Effect: Replace a unit in the Barracks: either 1

```
marksman with 1 soldier, or 1 soldier with 1 veteran. The replaced
unit goes back to your supply. Train Troops actions may be used
multiple times during a turn. If a new unit can not be placed on
an appropriate space in the Barracks, the action may not be
performed.
```
## CATHEDRAL

#### MARKSMAN BLESSING Location: One side of the stronghold.

```
Effect: During ranged combat, marksmen on this side of the
stronghold not engaged in melee combat fire all together at any
single rampart on this side of the stronghold.
```
#### ORDERS MIX-UP Location: None. Effect: Discard 1 invader order

```
without revealing it.
```
#### SHARPSHOOTERS Location: None. Effect: Kill 1 invader unit anywhere

```
on the board.

```
resolved at this wall section. Remove the token at the end of the
round.
```
## COURTYARD

```
The Courtyard can hold any number of units and heroes.
There are no special actions here: it is simply a holding place
for unassigned units.
```
## FORGE

#### CANNON Location: Tower. Effect: During ranged combat, choose the

```
foreground on this side of the stronghold, or the rampart opposite
the tower or adjacent to that rampart on this side. Reveal the top
card of the defender hit deck for each cannon and on a hit, kill one
of the indicated units (your choice). After all cannons have shot,
reshuffle the hit deck.
```
#### CAULDRON Location: Wall section. Effect: During melee combat, kill

```
invader unit(s): a troll or orc cauldron kills 1 corresponding unit at
that wall section; a goblin cauldron kills all goblins there.
```
## GUARDS

#### TRACKING SABOTEURS Effect: Remove 1 marksman on the Guards

```
from the game to remove all saboteur tokens from the stronghold
(return them to the invader).
```
## HOSPITAL

```
Place all defender units which die this turn in the Hospital. At the
end of each turn 2 of these units (your choice) recover and are
moved to the Courtyard. The rest of the units at the Hospital go
back to the supply.
```
## SCOUTS

#### MALFUNCTION Location: Ballista, Catapult, or Trebuchet.

```
Effect: This weapon may not fire during the next assault phase.
After the phase discard this token.
```
#### SPY Location: Invader action card. Effect: The invader must pay +

```
unit when activating the card. The spy may not be placed on phase
1 or 6 cards, and stays until the card is exchanged.
```
#### TRAP Location: Path (place facedown). A maximum of 1 trap may

```
be built on a single path. Effect: When the invader moves over a
trap reveal it. Target units are affected as follows:
Troll: Kill 1 troll

Siege tower: The siege tower cannot move this maneuver (it
may move in subsequent maneuvers to take another path).
```
## WORKSHOP

#### BAY WINDOW Location: Tower. Effect: Gain 1 strength at both wall

```
sections adjacent to this tower during melee combat if there is at
least 1 marksman in the tower.
```
#### LADDER Location: Wall section. Effect: +1 defender unit space at

```

```
#### POLE Location: Tower. Effect: During melee combat, choose 1 wall

```
section adjacent to this tower. Reveal the top card of the defender
hit deck for each pole. On a hit, kill the weakest of the indicated
invader units on that wall section. After all poles have been
resolved, reshuffle the hit deck.
```
#### WALL Location: Wall section. Effect: Place 1 wall component

```
on any wall section. There is no limit to the number of wall
components you may have on a single wall section.
```
#### THE ASSAULT

```
Phase 6 ends when the defender spends all their hourglasses.
Then the assault commences, played in the following stages:
```
## RANGED COMBAT

#### 1. CANNONS

```
The defender selects which foreground or rampart each cannon
will fire upon. Turn over 1 hit card per cannon and check the
Cannon portion of the card: remove 1 unit of the type indicated.
After all cannons have fired, reshuffle the hit cards and place them
next to the board.
```
#### 2. SIEGE MACHINES

```
The invader selects a wall section each siege machine will fire
upon.
Reveal the top card of each siege machine deck and resolve all
Hits. Discard all miss cards and return all hit cards to their deck
facedown. Reshuffle all machine card decks.
```
#### 3. MARKSMEN

```
Marksmen on the walls not currently engaged in melee combat
and marksmen in the towers may fire at invader units.
Marksmen on walls fire at the ramparts connected to their wall
section by paths. Marksmen in a tower fire at the ramparts
opposite their tower.
```
```
Every firing marksman adds +1 to the volley strength at that
rampart.
The total volley strength determines the total strength of the
invader units killed. The defender chooses which units to kill.
If there are invader units on a given wall section, the marksmen
on that section are engaged in melee combat and cannot shoot.
Marksmen in towers are never in melee combat.
```
## MELEE COMBAT

#### 1. CAULDRONS

```
The invader removes units killed by each cauldron.
```
#### 2. POLES

```
Each pole may attack 1 wall section adjacent to the tower
equipped with it.
For each pole, the defender declares which wall section is being
attacked, and reveals the top card of the hit deck. Check the Pole
section of the card. If a hit is shown, discard the invader unit with
the lowest strength attacking that wall section. Reshuffle the hit
deck after resolving all attacks.
```
#### 3. ORDERS

```
The invader reveals all order tokens (if they were facedown) and
resolves the effect of each order.
```
#### 4. RESOLVE STRENGTH

```
Both players sum the total strength of their respective units on
each wall section.
Invader Strength Point(s)
1 goblin unit 1
(3 if Goblin Fury order was issued)
1 orc unit^2
1 troll unit^3
1 banner 1
Defender Strength Point(s)
1 marksman unit^1
1 soldier unit^2
1 veteran unit^3
1 wall component 1
1 Bay Window with at least 1 marksman on it 1
The Officer^3
The Warrior^2
Melee combat at each wall section is won by the player with the
highest total strength. Subtract the losing player’s strength from
the winning player’s total to find the advantage.
The losing player must lose units (counted in strength points)
equal to the advantage. Invader units are killed and removed from
the game; defender units are placed in the Hospital.
```
```
Any time your units are killed as a result of combat or action, your
opponent chooses which of your units are killed.
If the advantage is greater than the strength of all defender units
on the wall, the invader has breached the wall (even if there is a
wall piece or hero there). The game ends and the invader wins.
```
#### END OF THE TURN

```
Before the next turn begins:
```
1. Remove all tokens which expire with the end of the turn.
2. The invader removes all units and wood from their action cards.
    Remove units from the game; return wood to the wood supply.
3. The defender removes all hourglasses from completed actions.
4. Move the round token 1 space. The defender now receives 2
    hourglasses to use after the first invader action. The invader
    begins the new round.


#### INVADER ACTIONS

```
Goblin (Str 1) Orc (Str 2) Troll (Str 3)
```
## PHASE 1: SUPPLIES

#### BRIEFING Randomly draw 14 units from the bag and place them

in your supply. Add to them 5 wood from the wood supply pile.

Then, at a cost of 1 hourglass, you may exchange any number
of action phase cards with those in your supply. Phase 1 and
6 cards may never be exchanged. Cards of the same phase
number may be rearranged by taking this action.

Resources You may, at a cost of 1 hourglass:
Discard 1 goblin to gain 1 or discard 1 orc to gain
2 or discard 1 troll to gain 3.

## PHASE 2: SIEGE MACHINES

Place the machine tile on an appropriate space of your choice.
