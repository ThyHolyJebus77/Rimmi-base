5. Scoring:
   - After all cards are used, players count their points:
     - +1 point for each completely filled row and column
     - +1 point for each uncovered tree
     - -1 point for each uncovered rock
     - Points for any other visible symbols on your board

#### OVERVIEW

After a long journey, you have finally arrived in a new land. You immediately start building and developing
your city.

My City is a legacy game. This means that the game will change and evolve as you play. You and your fellow
players will all have your game boards, which you will redesign in every episode. Each series of three episodes forms
a chapter. And for each chapter, there is a sealed envelope containing new rules and a variety of materials that make
it easy to change the game as you go along. In 24 fascinating episodes, you will experience the rise and the history
of your city from its very beginning through industrialization.

In addition, on the other side of the game board, you will find a version that you can play over and over again. You
will find the rules for that on pages 6 and 7 of this rulebook.

```

Helper App.
```
## Rulebook

```
A game by Reiner Knizia
for 2-4 players, ages 10 and up
```

4 two-sided game boards

```
My City is most appealing if the same group of players play and experience all the chapters together.
```
```
If you want to continue the game with different players, the new players will have to pick up where their predecessors
left off and continue accordingly.
```
```
After each episode, note where you have stopped. That way, you can easily continue the next episode when you resume.
Each of the 24 episodes can be played on its own. However, the game was designed so that three episodes combine to form
a thematic chapter. Gameplay for each chapter is about 90 minutes and is best enjoyed when played in a single sitting.
Important: No matter how curious you may be, do not open the sealed envelopes until you are playing the corresponding
chapter.
```
24 Construction cards

```
96 Playing Pieces (four sets, with eight buildings in three
colors in each set.)
```
8 Envelopes with
game materials

4 Scoring tokens

#### GAME MATERIALS

_During the game you will also need something to write with, such as a ball-point pen, for writing and drawing on your game boards._


#### GAME SETUP

- Before starting the first episode, carefully remove all die-
    cut pieces from their frames.
- Each player gets **one game board** and
    places it with the front side, which
    has an animal symbol at the upper
    left, face up in front of himself or herself. That will be the
    player’s personal game board for all 24 episodes. At the
    start, all game boards are identical. But during the course
    of the game, each player will be changing the game board.
    You will be applying stickers, developing new playing areas,
    and writing on the board. Don’t worry: That’s how it is
    meant to be played. After all, it’s your board. Right at the
    beginning, you will want to give your city a name. Write it
    in the space at the top, right next to the animal symbol.
- Each player gets a **scoring token** and sets it on the number
    **10** of his or her board’s scoring track.
    This scoring token is used to indicate your points
    during the episode and, most importantly, at the
    end of the episode.
- Each player gets the **24 playing pieces** (simply called
    “buildings” from now on) showing that player’s animal
    symbol on the back side. Just like the game boards, each
    player’s collection of buildings is otherwise identical. Place
    your buildings face up next to your game board (animal
    symbol face down). There are three types of buildings:
    residential (yellow), public (red), and industrial (blue).
- Shuffle the **24 construction cards** and place them in a
    single deck face down in the middle of the table. For each
    building, there is a corresponding construction card. In
    each episode, you will construct your buildings in the
    sequence shown on the construction cards as they are
    turned over.

#### GENERAL RULES OF THE GAME

There are a few rules that — with a few exceptions — apply
to all 24 episodes:

_Each episode consists of a number of rounds. In each round,
you will turn over the_ **_top construction card_** _of the face-down
deck and place it face up in a discard pile. Each player takes the
building matching the one depicted on the construction card
and places it on his or her game board. No delay or waiting is
allowed. All players place their buildings at the same time.
At the_ **_end of each episode,_** _you get_ **_points_** _for your buildings,
which you mark on your scoring track. Whoever gets the most
or second-most points in an episode is allowed to color in two or
one progress symbols, respectively. These progress symbols appear
as circles in two rows at the top edge of the game board._ **_The
player who has colored in the most progress symbols after
24 episodes is the overall winner of My City._**

#### THE CONSTRUCTION RULES

- Buildings may only be built on light green spaces.
- They may not be built in the mountains
    (gray spaces on the left) or the forest (dark green spaces
    on the right).
- Light green spaces with **rocks** or **trees** shown on them
    may be built upon. However, it is best to avoid building
    on light green spaces with trees if you can, because
    visible tree spaces will get you points at the end of each
    episode. Spaces with rocks should, on the other hand,
    be built upon whenever possible. If these are not covered
    with buildings at the end of the episode, points will be
    deducted.
- A building **may not be placed on the river** in such a way
    that it lies on both sides of the river.

```
You are allowed, however, to place a building along the
river, even if that means that the river becomes partly
covered.
```
- The **first** building that you place on your game board
    must be placed **alongside the river.** It is not enough to
    just have one corner touching the river.


- All other buildings must be positioned in such a way that
    they have at least one side **bordering another building.**
    Again, just having **a corner touching** is not enough.
       - **Ending participation in an episode: After** turning
          over a construction card, each player is always allowed
          to decide whether to end **his or her** participation in the
          episode. He or she announces this out loud and turns the
          unconstructed building over. When he or she does this,
          the player **does not lose any points** on the scoring track.
          He or she only loses a point if he or she passes but stays in
          the episode.

#### END OF AN EPISODE

```
An episode ends when all the players have ended their
participation in it. If this has not happened, an episode will
end after all the construction cards have been turned over.
```
###### Scoring:

```
Then, each player’s points are calculated and marked on the
scoring track.
c For each tree shown on a light green space on the game
board, the player gets one point.
c For each rock shown on a light green space on the game
board, the player loses one point.
c For each empty light green space visible on the game
board, the player loses one point.
```
```
Note: At the beginning, there are only spaces with two trees or
two rocks. These yield two points (added or subtracted). Later,
spaces with one tree will be added, which yield one point.
If a scoring token reaches 50 in the assessment,
the player is immediately allowed to color in
one progress symbol. The scoring token remains
standing at 50, even if extra points are added or deducted.
```
```
If it happens that a scoring token drops under
0, these negative points do not expire. They are
deducted from the next positive points earned.
```
###### Assessment of an episode:

```
After the points have been calculated, the episode is assessed.
The winners are allowed to color in additional progress
symbols on their boards.
```
```
Assessment with three or four players:
Whoever has attained the most points on the scoring track is
allowed to color in two progress symbols.
```
```
Whoever has attained the second-most points on the
scoring track is allowed to color in one progress symbol.
```
```
Assessment with two players:
Whoever has attained the most points on the scoring track is
allowed to color in two progress symbols.
Whoever has attained the second-most points on the
scoring track is not allowed to color in any progress
symbols. In a two-person game, in other words, only the top
player wins progress points.
```
- Buildings also count as bordering if the river is flowing
    between them.
- Buildings may **not be placed on top of buildings**
    **that are already constructed.**
- Once a building is placed, **it cannot be moved.**
- **Passing:** If a player **cannot or does not want to construct**
    a building, he or she is allowed to pass. He or she announces
    this out loud and places the building face down in front of
    himself or herself. He or she then has to move the scoring
    token **one step backward on the scoring track.**

```
Important: If the scoring token is already on zero,
passing is not an option. In this case, if the player cannot
or does not want to construct the building, he or she
must end his or her participation in the episode. He or
she is then not allowed to place any more buildings.
```

In **addition,** independent of their placement (first, second,
other), the players get various **stickers** which are applied
permanently to their game boards.

These stickers can be found in the sealed envelopes along
with other game materials. Inside, you will also find an
**overview table** showing what each player gets.

```
Important: If two or more players have attained the same
point total at the end of an episode, the player who has the
fewest empty light green spaces in the top row of his or her
game board will get the top placement. If the result in the
first row turns out equal, the second row is what counts, etc.
```
**_Note:_** _Color in the progress symbols from left to right. Start in
the top row, and when this is full continue at the left of the row
beneath it. This way, each player can easily see who has gained
how many progress symbols._

**_Example:_** _Before the scoring, the player has eight points. Since
she passed twice, she had to move the scoring token two steps
back during the episode.
For her eight trees, she adds eight points.
For her two rocks, she has to deduct two points.
In addition, she has to deduct eight points for the eight empty
light green spaces.
The player then ends her first episode with six points._

#### THE SEALED ENVELOPES

```
The eight sealed envelopes are a special feature of My City.
Inside each envelope, you will find a rule sheet containing a
few new rules for each group of three episodes. Also, you will
find an overview table, which summarizes on the left side
how points may be won or lost. Some of the points apply
immediately during an episode. Most (and later on, other
rewards as well) apply at the end of an episode.
```
```
Example from the overview table for episode 1:
```
```
On the right side of the overview table, you will see the
assessment for the relevant episode. This indicates which
player is allowed to color in progress symbols at the end of
the episode as described. Also indicated are which players get
which stickers (which are also found inside the envelope).
Some of the stickers are allocated at the beginning of an
episode, but most are assigned at the end.
```
```
Example from the
overview table for
episode 1:
```
```
To apply the stickers to your game board at the end of an
episode, you will first have to clear away all the buildings
from the game board.
Unless otherwise indicated, you have to affix the stickers to
empty light green spaces that show a small square in the
center.
In some of the envelopes, in addition to the stickers you will
find other materials that will be used in the game.
```
#### THE FIRST CHAPTER

```
Now that you know all the important rules, you can begin
your My City adventure.
```
```
You already know that there is one sealed envelope for
each chapter. You may now open the first envelope:
Chapter 1: The New Land — Episodes 1 to 3.
The envelope contains one rule sheet,
one overview table, and one small sheet
of stickers. Display the overview table
so all players can see it easily and keep
the sheet of stickers ready. If there are
stickers or other materials that you have not used at the end
of an episode, keep them in the box. Read the rule sheet for
Chapter 1 and place it in this rulebook after you have read it.
Now you can begin your first episode.
```
After the episode, the game board is cleared off and the
scoring token is placed on 10 again. In the next episode,
all the players start rebuilding their city as described in the
sealed envelope rule sheet.


#### THE ETERNAL GAME

Have you played all 24 episodes? If so, you have enjoyed a
unique gaming experience. You have guided the development
of your own city and witnessed eight chapters of its diverse
history.
But My City is not over. If you want to keep building your
city in competition with your fellow players, you will find a
version on the back of the game board that you can play over
and over. It more or less corresponds to episode 10 of the
legacy game.
In this version, all the game boards are identical. You can also
play it if you want to play every now and then with friends
who are not playing the legacy game. One of you has to have
at least played episodes one through five, however.

#### GAME SETUP

- Each player gets a game board and places it in front of
    himself or herself with the side shown here facing up.
- Each player gets one **scoring token** and places it on
    number **10** of the scoring track. This token will
    be used to mark your points during the episode
    and, most importantly, at the end of it.
- Each player gets a set of **27 buildings** , all of which must
    show the same animal symbol on the back side.
- Display your buildings face up next to your game board
    (animal symbols facing down). There are three types of
    normal buildings: eight residential buildings (yellow),
    eight public buildings (red), and eight industrial buildings
    (blue). In addition, each player has three churches (purple
    roofs).

```
Important: If you have already completed the legacy
game, you will have additional buildings with your
animal symbol. These are not used in the Eternal Game.
You will also ignore the stickers found on some of the
buildings.
```
- Shuffle the **28 construction cards** and place them in a
    single deck face down in the middle of the table. For each
    building, there is a corresponding construction card. You
    will construct your buildings in the sequence shown on the
    construction cards as they are turned over. In addition to
    the 24 cards with the normal buildings (eight in each of
    three colors) and the three churches, there is one blocking
    card in the deck.

```
Important: If you have already completed the legacy
game, you will have additional construction cards in
the deck. These are not used in the Eternal Game.
```
#### COURSE OF PLAY

```
Each game consists of a number of rounds. In each round,
you will turn over the top construction card of the face-
down deck and place it face up in a discard pile. Each
player takes the building matching the one depicted on the
construction card and places it on his game board. No delay
or waiting is allowed. All players place their buildings at the
same time.
At the end of the episode, you get points for your buildings
which you mark on your scoring track.
```
#### THE CONSTRUCTION RULES

- Buildings may only be built on light green spaces.
- They may not be built in the mountains or the forest.
- Light green spaces with **rocks** or **trees** shown on them
    may be built upon. However, it is best to avoid
    building on light green spaces with trees if you
    can, because visible tree spaces will get you
    points at the end of each episode. Spaces with
rocks should, on the other hand, be built upon whenever
possible. If these are not covered with buildings
at the end of the episode,
points will be deducted.
- A building **may not be placed on**
    **the river** in such a way that it lies
    on both sides of the river.
- You are allowed, however, to place
    a building **along the river,** even if
    that means that the river becomes
    partly covered.


- The first building that you place
    on your game board must be
    placed **alongside the river.** It
    is not enough to just have one
    corner touching the river.
- All other buildings must be positioned in such a way that
    they have at least one side **bordering another building.**
    Again, just having **a corner touching** is not enough.
- Buildings
    also count as
    bordering if the
    river is flowing
    between them.
- Buildings **may not be placed on top of buildings that**
    **are already constructed.**
- Once a building is placed, **it cannot be moved.**
- Try to construct **as many contiguous buildings of**
    **the same color as possible.** During the end-of-episode
    assessment, you will get extra points for each of the three
    colors. For each color, you will add up the number of
    buildings composing the **largest contiguous** group of this
    color and receive that number of points.
- **Passing:** If a player cannot or does not want to construct a
    building, he or she is allowed to pass. He or she announces
    this out loud and places the building face down in front of
    himself or herself. He or she then has to move the scoring
    token one step backwards on the scoring track. In other
    words, he or she loses one point.

```
Important: If the scoring token is already on zero, passing
is not an option. In this case, if the player cannot or does
not want to construct the building, he or she must end
participation in the episode. He or she is not allowed to
construct any more buildings.
```
- **Ending participation in an episode:** After turning over
    each construction card, each player is always allowed to
    decide whether to end **his or her own** participation in
    the episode. He or she announces this out loud and turns

```
the unconstructed building over. When he or she does
this, the player does not lose any points on the scoring
track. He or she only loses a point if he or she passes but
stays in the episode.
```
- Each **church** yields **three additional points** if you can
    manage to have a building in each of the three colors
    along three of its sides.
- Churches **must** be built! If a player is unable to construct
    the church shown on the uncovered construction card, he
    or she must end their participation in the episode, and can
    no longer construct any more buildings.
- If the **blocking card** is turned over, another card from
    the deck is immediately turned over as well.
    The building shown on that card must not be
    constructed — even if it is a church. Both cards
    are placed on the discard pile, with the blocking
    card on top. Each player turns the “blocked”
    building with its back side facing up. Then, the
    next construction card is turned over and play resumes as
    normal.
- The **wells** may be built upon just like rocks or trees.
    At the end of the episode, however, you will get
    **four extra points** if you manage to place **four**
    **buildings** adjacent to the well, one on each side.
- The **first** player to build on **both veins of gold** will
    announce this out loud and immediately get **three**
    **points.** If more than one player achieves that in
    the same round, each of them gets three points.

#### END OF EPISODE

```
An episode ends when all the players have ended their
participation in the episode. If this has not happened, an
episode will end after all the construction cards have been
turned over.
```
```
Then, each player’s points are calculated and marked with the
scoring tokens on the scoring track:
```
```
c Visible space with two trees: +2 points
c Visible space with two rocks: -2 points
c In each color: points = number of
buildings in largest group
c Three colors next to church: +3 points
c Four buildings next to well: +4 points
c Empty light green space: -1 point
```
```
The player with the most points is the winner.
If two or more players have attained the same point total,
the player who has the fewest empty light green spaces
in the top row of his or her game board will get the top
placement. If the result in the first row turns out equal, the
second row is what counts, etc.
