# WINDS OF NUMA SERA - Rules
[[Winds of Numa Sera.pdf]]

## INTRODUCTION

Vast, beautiful,and dangerous,the world of Ethera is full of unique cultures and kingdoms -- all vying for control of the landscape. From the ordained bloodline of Numa Sera, to the valiant knights of Dena Vale, to the “Cat People” of Meran, and the Pillaging Hordes of Siaa De’e. Each force will stop at nothing to advance its power.

As the leader of your people, your goal is to amass resources and create the most powerful kingdom in all of Ethera, so that your name will be remembered long after you are gone. There are several ways to achieve this: by conquering strongholds, slaying your opponents’ heroes, mastering skills, or earning new class titles. You can rule benevolently, cruelly, or anything in between. The choice is yours.

Whichever path you take, you will need to acquire assets to advance your heroes and grow your kingdom. Through exploration of Ethera’s many distinct environments, you will uncover rare items and enlist new allies to assist in your campaign. But exploration also has its risks: Ethera is a dangerous place, full of ancient secrets and hidden obstacles. So be ever vigilant…

The Winds of Numa Sera are blowing.

SETUP	3
2. ASSEMBLE THE PLAY AREA



THE GAME CARDS

There are six types of Game Cards identified by their different back colors:

CSeparate the cards by their backside colors.











Hero	Exploration   Stronghold	Item	Class	Skill



























4   SETUP
THE COMMUNAL PLAY AREA





























THE MAP BOARD

The Map Board is the communal play area of the game, and serves as:

D Where you place the Exploration Deck, World Forge Items Deck, Independent Strongholds, and Discard Pile.
D An actual map of Ethera and the continent of Numa Sera, to show you where cities and locations are in relation to one another.
D Where you will lay out the World Forge Items (purchasable Items) and Skill Training Colleges (purchasable Skills), so all Players can see them.




6   SETUP
SKILL TRAINING COLLEGES
CSeparate all Skill Cards (blue back) bySkill Type (Weapon, Defense, Forge, Agriculture, Lore). Each Skill deck will need cards equal to 3 plus the number of Players (for example in a 3-player game you will need 6 of each Skill Card). Return all unused Skill Cards to the Game Box.
CPlace these five decks face up in the Skill Training Colleges on the North side of the Map Board so that they are visible to all Players. They may also be kept face down to reduce visual complexity, but are meant to be read by Players before purchasing during gameplay.

INDEPENDENT STRONGHOLDS
CTo   create   the   Independent   Strongholds   Deck, randomly select a number of Stronghold Cards (green back) based on player count. Select 6/8/10 cards for 2/3/4 player games. Any unused cards are returned to the box.
CShufle all Stronghold Cards and place the face down Independent Strongholds Deck on the Map Board as indicated.
CDraw   the   top   four   cards   of   the   Independent Strongholds Deck and place them face up on the Map Board  as  shown.

THE WORLD FORGE
CSeparate the Item Cards (hazel back) and place them face down on the Map Board as shown. This will be known as the World Forge Deck.
CDraw the top four Item Cards from the World Forge Deck and place them face up in the designated area to the West Side of the Map Board as shown.

THE EXPLORATION DECK
CSeparate the Exploration Cards (brown back) and place them face down on the Map board as shown. This will be known as the Exploration Deck.

THE DISCARD PILE
The Discard Pile is where you place all discarded Cards. The Discard Pile should be face up and kept on the main Map Board as shown. When you start the game, this area will be empty.
D If you manage to go through the entire Exploration Deck during your game, then reshufle the Discard Pile to create a new Exploration Deck.

Setup	7
3. CHOOSE YOUR KINGDOM
& SET YOUR LINE OF SUCCESSION

There are four kingdoms that you can choose to play as, each represented by a Kingdom Mat that comes with its own distinct Build Tree, Starting Assets, and a unique triad of Heroes. While all of the Kingdoms have their unique strengths, some  are  better  suited  for  certain playing styles (Victory Conditions) than others, so choose yours wisely. For example, while one Kingdom  might  have  Heroes  with  stronger Attack   Stats,  another   might   have   a   more advanced  Build  Tree.

CChoose a Kingdom and take the matching Kingdom Mat.

















Numa   Sera:   Wealthy   and   insulated, the  Ordained  Bloodline  of  the  Eastern Kingdom have an impressive infrastructure and know how to amass Capital quickly. Numa Sera is the strongest for achieving a Master victory.

Meran: Keen and honorable, the Majestic Guardians of the Western Kingdom are fierce  fighters,  who  throughout  history have  fended  off  invaders  that  seek  to conquer their small but valuable region. They are adept scavengers that can find value  in  what  others  discard. Meran  is the  strongest  for  achieving  a  Legend victory.


Siaa  De’e:  Strong  and  aggressive,  the Pillaging	Hordes	of	the	Southern Kingdom  take  what  they  want,  when they want it. They are ferocious attackers with battle in their blood, but are poor at  defending  what  little  they  have  of their own. Siaa De’e is the strongest for achieving  a  Champion  victory.

Dena  Vale:  Tough  and  resilient,  the Valiant Knights of the Northern Kingdom are well-trained, self-suficient, and know how to defend what they conquer. Dena Vale  is  the  strongest  for  achieving  a Conqueror  victory.



8   SETUP
PLAYER AREA























The   Kingdom   Mat   is   divided   into   multiple sections. Each section serves a specific purpose. As you acquire cards, some will be placed around your Kingdom Mat in specific areas, as seen in the Player Area layout.

The white areas of the Kingdom Mats are meant to be written on, but ONLY with a DRY ERASE Marker.



LINE OF SUCCESSION


There   are   three   total   Heroes   per   Kingdom. However, only one Hero can be active at a time. This  means  that  choosing  the  order  of  your Heroes, referred to as your Line of Succession, is paramount, as you will only play as the other two Heroes if your Active Hero is Slain. ASlain Hero is a Hero whose Power (Health) is reduced to 0. We will explain this further in the Slain Heroes section on page 38.

CFind all Heroes (Orange back) from the Hero Deck with matching Kingdom colors and sigils, and add them to your Kingdom.




Setup	9
SETUP
HOW TO
READ A HERO CARD

Each Hero has three Base Stats, as well as a Special Ability that gives them a unique set of strengths and weaknesses
D On the UPPER LEFT	of every Hero Card are two numbers, one marked with a sword and the other with a shield. The first number (sword icon)  is  the  Hero’s  Base  Attack  Stat.    The second number directly below it (shield icon) is the Hero’s Base Defense Stat. In every Battle there is always an attacker and a defender.

D On the BOTTOM RIGHT	of every Hero Card is the Hero’s Maximum Power Stat. Power is the equivalent to Health or Life in this game.


D Written on the CENTER SCROLL of each Hero Card is that Hero’s Special Ability. Their specific Special Ability is only available to you so long as that Hero is your Active Hero. If your Hero is Slain during the game (If their Power reaches 0), that Hero has perished and thus your next Hero in your Line of Succession becomes your Active Hero.

CChoose  your  Line  of  Succession:  Organize your Hero Cards in the order you wish to play them, with your starting Active Hero on top. Place all of your Hero Cards in a “Spread Stack” on your Kingdom Mat, face up, in the “Heroes” area as shown.



4	1	10




CWrite in your Active Hero’s Stats (with a DRY ERASE marker) into the corresponding Hero Stats Boxes below your Active Hero.

Any unused Kingdom Mats and Hero Cards (orange back) should be stored in the Game Box, as they will not be used in this game.



4. DISTRIBUTE STARTING ASSETS



Each Kingdom begins the game with a certain amount of Capital and Battle Cards indicated on the middle panel of your respective Kingdom Mats, just below your Battlefield. You’ll need to set yourself up with both. Each Kingdom also comes with a Pre-Ticked Build Block; the equivalent of an Ongoing Special Ability.


10   SETUP
CAPITAL	STARTING BATTLE CARDS




Capital is your currency, and takes a numeric value. The game comes with Capital Coins of different amounts.



CAPITAL COINS







Copper (worth 1 Capital), Silver (worth 5 Capital), and Gold (worth 20 Capital).

CDistribute the respective amount of Capital Coins  to  each  Player  as  indicated  on  the Kingdom  Mats’  Starting  Assets  plaque.
CPlayers place their Capital Coins on their Kingdom Mats.


CFind any 15 random Battle Cards (red frontside) from the Exploration Deck and remove them.
CShufle the removed Battle Cards. CDistribute the corresponding number of
Battle Cards face down to the Players as indicated on their Kingdom Mats.
D Battle Cards stay in your Hand until you are ready to play them. Other players should not see the cards in your Hand.
CReturn the remaining Battle Cards to the Exploration Deck (brown back). Reshufle the deck and place the Exploration Deck face down on the communal Map Board as indicated.







DISTRIBUTE CLASS CARDS








D All remaining Capital Coins should be placed on the table in the Communal Play Area (or inside the game box) where all Players can reach them. This will be known as the World Bank - where you pay Capital to, and where you Gain Capital from.


CDistribute all five Class cards to each player, so that they have one of each Class type. These cards can be stored in Players’ Hands or below their Kingdom Mats face down, until they have been unlocked.



Setup  11
SETUP
5. DETERMINING WHO GOES FIRST

Whichever Player was the last person to be in a Castle goes first, and play continues clockwise from there. If no one has ever been to a Castle, then they definitely should plan to visit one! But for now, age before beauty - the eldest player goes first, and play continues clockwise from there.

Now you’re ready to begin the game!



S EQUENCE OF PLAY TURN OVERVIEW
There are two primary Phases to each Turn. Phase 1: Explore, and Phase 2: Build or Attack. These two Phases occur in every Player’s Turn, and must occur in that order. There are several Other Actions that you can take throughout your Turn, but the Build/Attack actions must always be taken last, and you CANNOT do both in the same Turn, unless specifically instructed otherwise by a card.
D You must Declare all actions before taking them, so other Players know what you are doing.

“Start of Turn” Actions: Certain Cards (like some Heroes and Controlled Strongholds) have Special Abilities or benefits that specifically instruct you to take an action at the start of your Turn. Be sure to pay attention to these, if applicable, at the start of your Turn.



PHASE 1 - EXPLORE: The first Phase of your Turn begins with discovery. Draw an Exploration Card from the Exploration Deck to see what you find. Most of the encounters during exploration will be useful to you; however, there are some things out there that can hurt you. You can only Explore once per Turn, unless a card specifically states otherwise.





12   SETUP

OTHER ACTIONS: Any of the below actions can take place at any point during your Turn, so long as they occur BEFORE your phase 2 actions (Build or Attack). You may take these Other Actions multiple times during your Turn.
D BUY ~ You can spend Capital to learn Skills from the Skill Training Colleges, and purchase Items from the World Forge.
D EQUIP ~ To make use of an Item you must Equip it to your Hero. You only gain the Item’s benefits and/or can use their special abilities, when the Item is equipped to your Hero.
D TRADE ~ You can propose trades with other players, which can include paying other players to attack others, or not attacking you for a Turn.
D USE ~ During the game, you’ll acquire certain Cards that you can activate (Use) during your Turn. Special Abilities can come in the form of Ongoing, Once Per Turn, and One Time Use.



PHASE 2 - BUILD or ATTACK: For the final phase of your Turn, you must choose whether to keep your forces at home to help Build up your Kingdom and expand your unique Build Tree, or send your forces out to war and Attack another Hero or Stronghold.

D BUILD: In Ethera, you will need Capital in order to use Battle Cards, learn Skills, and Trade. There are several ways to gain Capital, but the most common way is through Building. However, choosing to Build prohibits you from Attacking in the same Turn, and you can only Build once per Turn, unless a card specifically says otherwise.



~OR~


D ATTACK: In order to Slay Heroes and Conquer Strongholds, you will need to enter into Battle with them. Choose a Player’s Hero, Controlled Stronghold, or an Independent Stronghold to
do Battle with. While both sides can receive damage in Battle, Ties
always go to the attacker, so there are advantages to striking first. If you took the Build action you cannot Attack this Turn, unless a card specifically says
otherwise, and a Player can only Attack once per Turn.





SETUP     13




Start of Turn Actions are engine-builders that generate capital which generally can only be spent on specific cards or used during specific instances. When the game begins, the only possible Start of Turn actions will be from your Active Hero (and not all Heroes have one). As the game progresses, you can acquire more Start of Turn actions.


CYou always begin your Turn by checking for Start of Turn actions, and resolving them.









CTake the specified Capital coins from the Word Bank and place it on the card as instructed. You will do this at the start of each of your turns so long as you possess the respective card and it is in play.








D Any time a Start of Turn action tells you to place Capital on a card, you always take the Capital from the World Bank, unless specifically instructed to use your own Capital.







14   SETUP
P HASE 1 EXPLORING
As your Heroes journey across the lands of Ethera, their encounters will be represented by the cards you draw from the Exploration Deck. In this deck you will find powerful Items, influential Mavens, useful Battle techniques, and incredible Boons to help your Hero…as well as terrible dangers.

Exploring is the first Phase of your Turn and must always come before the Build/Attack phase. However, you can take any of the Other Actions before Exploring if you like.

CTake the Explore action by drawing a card from the top of the Exploration Deck.
































SETUP     15 P











TYPES OF EXPLORATION CARDS


There are six different types of Exploration Cards. Each type of Exploration Card has a unique color scheme and icon which can be found on the upper left corner of the card. The name of the Card’s type is also displayed in text on the bottom right.


REVEAL VS. HAND

There are certain Exploration Cards that must be Revealed and Resolved as soon as you draw them. These “Reveal” cards are identified by the open eye icon at the bottom center of the card.






The Effects of the card are written in gold text, and usually come with a choice that must be made in order to Resolve the Effect.
D A card is Resolved when a Player has taken all of the required actions as instructed on the card in order to “resolve” it.

Exploration Cards without the open eye icon go into your Hand to be played or activated later, and should be kept hidden from other Players. However, you can play a Hand card as soon as you draw one. For example, if you wanted to Equip an Item you can do so immediately after drawing it.

CIf you draw a Reveal card, show it to the other Players and read its Effects out loud. Resolve the Effect as indicated. You cannot take other actions until the card is completely Resolved.
CIf you draw a Hand card, hold onto it and don’t show anyone until you are ready to use it.
HOW TO READ A CARD


While each of the six Exploration Card Types vary, there is a system to reading each card in the game:



















Card type icon

Card name

Card Cost to play or acquire:

For Battle Cards, this number is the Capital or Power cost to play the Card in Battle.

For Skill Cards, this is the Capital it costs to purchase and use the card. It’s multiplied by the number of whichever Level you are acquiring. Further explained in the Skill Cards section.

For World Forge Item Cards, this is the Capital it costs to purchase that card from the World Forge.


Italicized text = Flavor

Body text light blue = Choice/Condition that must occur in order to acquire

Equipment Slot icon

Body text gold = Effect/Special Ability

If	eye icon = Reveal card to all players and Resolve

Card Type name


If you are eager to begin playing, you can skip  over  the  section  below  for  now, and simply look up the respective card types as you  draw  them.








Phase 1: Exploration  17 P
SETUP
BOON CARDS
















Boon Cards, as the name implies, are always good. They generally provide rewards in the form of additional Capital or allow you to Heal (recover lost Power).
D Boon Cards are Revealed, Resolved, and then Discarded.
CWhen you draw a Boon Card, reveal it to all players. If the Boon offers you a choice of benefits, you must Declare your selection, then adjust
your Kingdom Mats (ex. Power Stat and Capital Coins) accordingly to resolve the card.

HAZARD CARDS
















Hazard Cards are the exact opposite of Boon Cards. They generally have some sort of negative effect or risk.
D Hazard Cards are Revealed, Resolved, and then Discarded.
D If a Hazard Card offers a choice, you may choose either option. Some options cannot be chosen if you do not have the required resource.
D If a Hazard Cards effect reduces a Hero to 0 Power, the Slain Hero does not count towards a Champion victory.
CIf you draw a Hazard Card, reveal it to all players. If the Hazard offers you a choice, Declare your selection and then adjust your Kingdom Mat (ex. Power Stat and Capital Coins) accordingly to resolve the card.



CAfter doing so, place the Boon Card face up on the Discard Pile.


CAfter doing so, place the Hazard Card face up on the Discard Pile.




18   SETUP
MAVEN CARDS

















Maven Cards are valuable experts and advisors that can provide your Hero with Special Abilities.
D Each Maven is a Reveal card that offers you a choice. You can accept the Maven, and bring them on as a trusted advisor to serve in your Inner Circle. OR you can reject the Maven by discarding them in order to Gain Capital or Heal Power (as stated on the card).

There are three different types of Maven’s Special Abilities:
D Ongoing - an ongoing buff or ability that is always active or usable. If the Effect does not specifically state otherwise, it is an ongoing effect.
D Once Per Turn - a repeatable action that can only be taken once per turn and usually comes with a dice roll to trigger activation.
D One Time Use - an action that requires the Maven to be Discarded upon successfully triggering the action. Some One Time Use Abilities require the card to be Discarded, whether successful or not.
CIf you wish to Use a Maven’s Special Ability, Declare it, and then take the action as indicated.


CIf you draw a Maven Card, Declare your choice:
CIf you Reject the Maven, then place their card in the Discard Pile, and receive the designated benefit (Capital/Power). Note that you can only Heal up to your Hero’s Max Power Stat.
CIf you Accept the Maven, then place their card below your Kingdom Mat near the Heroes Box, as indicated, to show that they are now part of your Inner Circle. The Maven’s Special Ability can be used immediately or saved for later.







19 P
BATTLE CARDS
















Battle Cards can greatly sway the outcome of a Battle, as they provide temporary bonuses or deductions to your stats and rolls. Battle Cards can only
be played during Battle and each Player may only play 1 Battle Card per Battle unless specifically instructed by a card.
CIf you draw a Battle Card, place it in your Hand to be played later during Battle.
D Battle Cards either cost Capital or Power in order to play them. The Cost is displayed in the upper right corner of the card. The icon behind the number determines whether the Cost is in Capital or Power.





Capital	Power
D All Battle Cards are discarded after they are played.

We will explain the Battle Cards in further detail in the Attacking / Battling section.




20   BATTLE CARDS
ITEM CARDS

EQUIP

As soon as you acquire an Item, you can Equip it.If you take an Item from another Player’s Hero during Battle, you must wait until your next Turn to Equip it.











Item Cards can provide Stat Bonuses or unique abilities to your Hero once equipped.


There are two types of Item Cards in the game:

World Forge Items (hazel back) are Items that can be purchased at the World Forge and have the ability to be Upgraded using Forge Training Skill Cards (which we’ll explain in further detail in the BUY Section).

Mythic Items (brown back) are rare artifacts that are only found in the Exploration Deck. Mythic  Items  are  generally  more  powerful than  World  Forge  Items, and  therefore  they are  not  Upgradable. They  also  come  with  a Prerequisite Skill Training in order to equip.

D Every Item has a designated Equipment Slot, and  the  Item  must  be  Equipped  to  your Hero in order to gain its benefits.
D You can only Equip Items to your Active Hero.

D There are five Equipment Slots in total: Head

Chest

Right Hand

Left Hand

Pack

D You may Equip up to five items at once. Two-handed  weapons  count  as  two  slots.

D You can only take the Equip action during your Turn, and the action must occur before Phase 2 (Build/Attack). For example, if you steal  an  Item  from  another  Player’s  Hero during Battle, you must wait until your next Turn to Equip it.

CWhether you purchase an Item from the World Forge or find a Mythic Item while Exploring, you can choose to Equip it immediately, offer to Trade it, or place it in your Hand for later.
CIf you choose to Equip the Item, place the card to the left of your Kingdom Mat as indicated, and adjust your Hero’s Stat Boxes accordingly using a DRY ERASE marker.
CIf you wish to Equip an Item in a slot your Hero already has filled, swap out the Item Card that is currently equipped to your Hero and replace it with the new Item you wish to Equip. The unequipped Item is returned to your Hand. Be sure to adjust your Stat Boxes accordingly.

POOL OF ESSENCE CARDS















Pool of Essence Cards refer to the legendary bodies  of  concentrated  life  energy  known as Essence. Created by the First Ones and left to the world before they retreated into their eternal slumber, the Pools are imbued with immense power and are protected by a special creature called an Essential. Sworn to an ancient oath, the Essential’s sole purpose is  to  determine  which  of  the  Pool’s  few finders are worthy to gain its Special Ability.

In order to be found worthy, and be granted permission  to  drink  from  the  Pool,  the Essential offers you, its finder, a Test. Should you complete the Test, you will be able to gain the Special Ability of the Pool.
Each Pool of Essence has a unique Test and Special   Ability.
CUpon drawing a Pool of Essence card from the Exploration Deck, add it to your Hand. On your Turn, you may reveal this card to complete its Test.
CWhen you complete the Test, take the card and place  it  face  up  on  your  Battlefield  over  the Turn Overview to indicate that you have been Blessed and gained its Special Ability. If your Blessed Hero is Slain, return the Pool card to your Hand. You can repeat the Test to bestow the Special Ability on your newly active Hero.

Victory  Condition,  in  which  a  Player wins the game by reaching Level 4 in one  Skill  Type. At  the  Skill  Training Colleges,  you’ll  find  “Experts”  whom you can pay to teach you new Skills or sharpen  ones  you  already  have.  The cost to purchase and learn the Skill is indicated on the upper right of the card (10  Capital  x  Level).
The five Types of Skills:


The cost of a World Forge Item is indicated on the upper right if the card. Each World Forge Item has a base effect  and  then  an  upgraded  effect that can only be unlocked by aquiring Forge Training Skill cards.

24   POOL OF ESSENCE CARDS


D Players can be trained in the same Skill Type up to 4 times. The first Skill Card you buy is Level 1 in that Skill Type. The second Card of the same Type is Level 2, and so on. You cannot skip Levels.
D 10 Capital x Level: It costs 10 Capital to become Level 1 of any Skill Type. In order to advance to Level 2,you must already have one card of that Skill Type. It costs 20 Capital to buy your second card of the same Skill Type and advance you to Level 2, 30 Capital to advance you to Level 3 (must already have Level 2), and 40 Capital to advance you to Level 4 (must already have Level 3).
D For  clarity,  if  one  Player  buys  the  first Weapon Training Skill Card, another Player would still only have to pay 10 Capital to Buy their first Weapon Training Skill Card because it is only making them a Level 1 as well. There are a limited number of Skill Cards in each deck. When a Skill deck runs out, no one can Buy more Skill Cards of that type.
D Remember,  each  Skill  deck  has  a  limited number of cards. (3 + the number of Players)

D As you advance Levels, you unlock additional bonuses.  Not  every  Level  offers  you  an additional bonus, as you will see indicated on certain Skill Cards. For example, in some cases  there  is  no  additional  bonus  when rising from Level 2 to 3.
D Skills are NOT stackable. You only benefit from the specific bonuses of your current Skill Level. For example, if you have a Level 2, you do not get the bonuses of Level 1 and Level 2, only that of Level 2.
D The Skill Training Colleges can be placed face up or down. If placed face down, Players should look at the front sides of Skill cards before  purchasing.  The  back  sides  of  the Skill Cards visually convey what they affect/ improve.






CIf you acquire 4 Skill Cards of the same Type, you become a MASTER and have fulfilled 1 of the 4 Victory Conditions.


Positioning your Skill Cards: If you Buy a Skill, pay the required Capital to the World Bank, then take the Skill Card  and place it on the side of your Kingdom Mat as shown. As  you  acquire  additional  Skill  Cards  of the same Skill Type, place them behind the matching Skill Card in a Spread Stack so that other Players can see how many you have.







D When  Purchasing  a  Forge  Training  Skill Card,   you   must   then   designate   which Equipment  Slot  you  are  Upgrading.   You do this by “Ticking” the selected slot on the left side of your Kingdom Mat, using the DRY  ERASE  Marker.    You  may  now  use the “Upgraded” ability shown on the Item instead of the baseline ability. Note that a two-handed  weapon  requires  two  slots  in order  to  Upgrade.

Other Actions

O THER ACTIONS

There are four Other Actions you can take during your Turn: Buy (p24), Trade (below), Equip (p21), and Use (p28). These actions can take place anytime during your Turn so long as they are before your Attack/Build Phase. You may take these other actions multiple times during your Turn. For clarity, this means you can take Other Actions before the Explore Phase if you like.


TRADE

On your Turn you may offer to Trade Cards, Power, Capital, and actions with another Player. You set the terms of the Trade. The trade only happens if both Players agree to the terms.

All Card types can be traded except for Heroes and Classes.
CLASS CARDS

D The five Classes are: Heir, Paladin, Rogue, Sage and Tyrant.
D You can acquire multiple Classes, and can gain the benefits of each of them simultaneously.
CAs you unlock new Classes, add them above your Kingdom Mat.









Over the course of the game, you can earn Class Cards by
achieving specific goals. Classes are distinctions of status and prestige that result from your action, and become part of your legacy. Each Class provides you with a specific ongoing benefit until the game has ended. Acquiring 5 Class Cards is also another way to win the game.

D The back sides of the Class Cards visually convey what you need to achieve in order to unlock that Class.









CIf you have unlocked all 5 different Class Types, you become a LEGEND and have fulfilled 1 of the 4 Victory Conditions.


CWhen you complete the Task on a Class Card, take that Class Card from your Hand and place it face up above your Kingdom Mat as indicated to show other players you have unlocked it.

CTo Use a Special Ability, Declare the action, and execute the Special Ability as indicated on the card.
CIf the Card is a “One Time Use”, then discard it after the action is taken by placing it face up on the Discard Pile.
P HASE 2 BUILD OR ATTACK

For the final Phase of your Turn, you must choose to either Build or Attack.

PHASE 2: BUILDING


In the world of Ethera, empires rise and fall on their access to wealth. To win, your Kingdom and Heroes will need to amass Capital in order to Buy Items, Learn Skills, and Use Battle Cards that will help you to secure victory. The most reliable way to gain Capital is by taking the Build action.

D Whenever  you  take  the  Build  Action,  you gain your Residual Capital and then choose a  Build  Block  to  unlock  a  unique  benefit. You always gain the Residual Capital before choosing  the  Build  Block.


RESIDUAL CAPITAL



Residual Capital is the total amount of  Capital  you  collect  whenever  you take the Build action. Every Kingdom
starts the game with a unique amount of Base Residual  Capital,  shown  at  the  top  of  your Build Tree printed inside the Residual Capital Box  (outlined  in  green).  This  is  the  same number as your Kingdom’s Starting Capital.


C Whenever	you	unlock	additional Residual Capital, be sure to write in the new amount of Residual Capital in the corresponding  Kingdom  Box  (outlined in Green at the top of your Build Tree) using the provided DRY ERASE marker. Note that your Base Residual Capital amount is already printed in this Box, so be sure to not count it twice.

D Throughout the game you can raise your Residual Capital number by expanding your Build Tree, conquering new Strongholds or learning new Skills.

D When Building, you collect the Residual Capital before choosing the Build Block to unlock.


PPOOL OF ESSENCE CARDS     29 P
hase 2: Building
THE BUILD TREE


Each Kingdom has a unique Build Tree full of Build Blocks that you can “Tick” to unlock new sources of Capital and other advantages. You  can  stack  benefits  by  choosing  to  Build often and acquiring more Blocks.

D You Tick a Build Block by writing a check mark  in  the  white  hexagon  directly  above the selected Build Block you wish to acquire, using the provided Dry Erase marker.
D You can only add (“Tick”) one Build Block action per Turn, as part of your Build Phase.
D You  must  have  the  previous  Build  Block, linked by the white line, in order to Tick the next Block in the branch.



P In   the   example   shown,   you   can’t   Tick Bountiful Empire, because you don’t already have  Eficiency  Ticked.  But  you  can  Tick Eficiency   because   you   already   have   the prerequisite   Build   Block,   Tithe,   Ticked.













D Certain   Build   Blocks   have   additional Prerequisites, identified  by  the  red  text. You must have achieved the Prerequisite in order  to  unlock  that  Block.
D If a Build Block is connected by dotted lines, that means you only need to have one of the connecting Build Blocks in order to Tick that next Build Block.
THE THREE BUILD BLOCK TYPES


There are three different types of Build Blocks, each identified by a unique icon and color:


Once - when you Tick this Block, you receive the benefits only this one time.

Ongoing - when you Tick this Block, you activate the benefit in perpetuity. Note that you will receive some of these benefits on other Player’s Turns.

Repeatable  -  When  you  Build,  you  can choose this Block again to Gain its benefits multiple times. You only physically Tick this Bubble once even though you can choose it multiple times.

TAKING THE BUILD ACTION


CIf you decide to Build, Declare to the other Players that you are Building,then collect your Residual Capital coins from the World Bank. Then Tick (draw a small check in) the Build Block that you wish to unlock. Use the DRY ERASE marker. Take the action as indicated in the Ticked Block, and adjust your Capital and Stat Boxes accordingly.

D Remember, If you choose to Build, you are NOT allowed to Attack in the same Turn.

P HASE 2 ATTACKING	STRONGHOLD CARDS


Attacking    is    the    only    way    to    conquer Strongholds  and  the  most  effective  way  to Slay other Player’s Heroes.  When you Attack, you  can  choose  to  target  1  of  3  things:  an Independent  Stronghold,  another  Player’s Stronghold, or another Player’s Active Hero.

We will go through Battling in further detail in the following sections as we walk you through each type of Battling scenario.





Stronghold    Cards    represent a  castle  or  garrison  of  a  given territory.  New  Strongholds  are drawn from the Stronghold Deck
and are Independent until conquered and Controlled by a Player. If you are able to conquer a Stronghold in a single Battle, you  Gain  the  Stronghold  Card  and  the benefits that come with it. The benefits vary by Stronghold, but all of them get you one card closer to the CONQUEROR Victory   Condition.









CIf you Control 4 Strongholds at the same time, you become a
CONQUEROR and have fulfilled 1 of the 4 Victory Conditions.



HOW TO READ A STRONGHOLD CARD:

BATTLING: PLAYER VS INDEPENDENT STRONGHOLD

CIf you are attacking an Independent Stronghold, you start the Battle by declaring which one you are attacking.







4	= Stronghold’s Defense Stat

5    = Initial Capital amount gained immediately from the World Bank on Independent Conquer.


+3	= The amount of Residual Capital you can add to your Build Tree upon conquering.





Every Stronghold has a Start of Turn action which is only activated once conquered. Most of these serve as Engine-Builders, earning you additional Capital which can only be used for certain spending.


The light blue text tells you how many Capital Coins to place on the card from the World Bank at the start of each of your Turns (so long as it is under your control).

In  order  to  win  the  Battle  and  conquer  the INDEPENDENT Stronghold, your Attack Total Score (ATS) must be equal to or greater than the Stronghold’s  Defense  Stat.





THE BATTLEFIELD

In the middle area of your Kingdom Mat are your Battlefield Tally Boxes. Here is where Players will tally and determine their Total Scores.






The gold text tells you the effects of the card, or how exactly you can spend the Capital that accrues on it.

BATTLING MECHANICS

When  you  enter  a  Battle,  there  is  always  an Attacker and a Defender. Strongholds are always the   Defender,  as   Strongholds   cannot   Attack Players.

ATS - DTS = OUTCOME

D Attacker’s   Total   Score   minus   Defender’s Total Score equals Outcome (and Damage dealt) and determines the winner of the Battle.

D (Attacking Player’s	Hero Attack Stat) + (Attacker’s	Battle Roll) = Attacker’s Total Score (ATS).


STEP 3 : BATTLE ROLL

The Battle Die is a modified six-sided die with numbers
-3, -2, -1, +1, +2, +3.


CRoll the Battle Die to determine your Battle Roll. Write the result into your Battle Roll Box on your Battlefield.

CIf the number is negative, subtract it from your Attack Stat. If it’s positive, then add it. This now determines your Attack Total Score (ATS). Write that number into your Total Score Box on your Battlefield.



D (Defending Player’s       Hero/Stronghold Defense Stat) + (Defender’s        Battle Roll) = Defender’s Total Score (DTS).



4	3	7




STEP 1 : BATTLEFIELD
CSince you are the Attacker, carry over your Active Hero’s Attack Stat into the Battlefield Stat Box, making sure to account for all Stat increases that you have acquired. Use only a DRY ERASE marker.

STEP 2 : BATTLE CARDS
D If you are going to use a Battle Card, you do so after declaring Battle but before rolling dice. For this example, we are NOT going to play a Battle Card. See the following Battling: Player vs Player section for a walkthrough that shows utilization of Battle Cards.








STEP 4 : OUTCOME

D Since  you  are  attacking  an  Independent Stronghold in this Battle, and not another Player, the Defender’s Total Score (DTS) is  already  predetermined  as  Independent Strongholds   do   not   get   a   Battle   Roll. Therefore the Stronghold’s DTS is the same as its Defense Stat: 4.

D If your Attack Total Score (ATS) is equal to or greater than the Stronghold’s Defense Stat, then you win the Battle. In this example, your ATS was 5, and the Stronghold’s Defense Stat (as shown on the upper left of the card) was 3. Therefore you won the Battle and can Gain the Stronghold Card.


34   POOL OF ESSENCE CARDS
IF YOU WIN THE BATTLE

CIf you manage to conquer the Stronghold in a single Battle and claim it as your own, then you  are  awarded  that  Stronghold’s  benefits. Place  the  now  conquered  Stronghold  Card above your Kingdom Mat as shown to indicate it is under your Control.


IF YOU LOSE THE BATTLE

CIf your Attack Total Score (ATS) is less than the Independent Stronghold’s Defense Stat, then you lose the Battle and incur Damage. Subtract your ATS from the Stronghold’s Defense Stat, and your Hero receives that much Damage to their Power Stat. For example, if your Attack Total Score was 3 and the Stronghold’s Defense Stat is 6; your Hero takes 3 points of Damage. This is subtracted from the Hero’s current total Power Stat. Use only a DRY ERASE Marker to adjust this number.









CDraw a new Independent Stronghold Card from the top of the Stronghold Deck and place it face up where the previous Stronghold was. This is now one of the four visible Strongholds that Players can choose to Attack.

IF YOU TIE THE BATTLE

CThe Tie always goes to the Attacker. If ATS = DTS and both sides arrive at the same Score, the Attacker wins the Battle, and takes the Stronghold. Battle Cards that read “If you win the Battle” take effect if you played them.


D Once you control a Stronghold, be mindful of the benefits as they all vary. All award you a one time Capital Gain upon conquering, unlock additional Residual Capital (to be added to your Build Tree), and come with Start of Turn actions.

BATTLING: PLAYER VS PLAYER’S HERO

If you are attacking a Player’s Hero, you start the Battle by declaring their Active Hero  as  your  target.


STEP 2 : BATTLE CARDS
CIf Players wish to play Battle Cards, they place their selected card face down on their Battlefields in the designated areas.

ATTACKER	DEFENDER


In the walkthrough below, the Attacking
Player has chosen to Attack the Defending	4	2 Player’s  Hero.


STEP 1 : BATTLEFIELD
CPlayers carry over their Hero Stats to their respective Battlefields, using a DRY ERASE marker. The Attacking Player always uses their Hero Attack Stat when attacking. The Defending Player, in this example, uses their Hero Defense Stat because their Hero is being attacked.


ATTACKER

CBoth players then reveal their Battle Cards simultaneously, and adjust their respective Capital Coins or Power Stat boxes according to the cost; seen on the upper righthand corner of their Battle Cards. Any change in Power brought about by the Battle Card will be reflected in a Player’s Hero Power Stat Box on the lower left hand side of their Kingdom Mat.

SLAIN HEROES

If a Hero’s Power Stat reaches 0, that Hero is Slain.
D If your Hero is Slain by another Player, the Slaying Player takes your Slain Hero Card and places it above their Kingdom Mat face up as shown.
D If there was Capital on the Hero Card when that Hero was Slain, the Slaying Player collects that Capital, and adds it to their Kingdom Mat.















CIf you have Slain 3 Heroes belonging to other Players, you become a CHAMPION and have fulfilled 1 of the 4 Victory Conditions.
This does not need to be three Heroes from one Player.

D If your Hero is Slain while Exploring or during Battle with an Independent Stronghold NOT controlled by another Player, place the (now Slain) Hero Card face down and tuck it behind the last
Hero in your Line of Succession, so that the orange back side is still partially visible to all Players.

ELIMINATION

Players are eliminated from the game if all 3 of their Heroes are Slain.
BATTLING: PLAYER VS. PLAYER’S STRONGHOLD



So far, we’ve covered Attacking an Independent Stronghold and Attacking another Player’s Hero. Now we’ll show you how to Attack a Stronghold controlled by another Player. Attacking another Player’s Stronghold can swing the momentum of a game if you are victorious: not only are you gaining the benefits of that Stronghold, but you are also taking them away from that Player.

D When a Stronghold controlled by a Player is attacked, the Defending Player does NOT use their Hero’s Defense Stat. Instead, they use the Stronghold’s Defense Stat. Be sure to account for Stat bonuses that apply to Strongholds.
D The Attacking Player uses their Hero’s Attack Stat and calculates their Attack Total Score (ATS) normally.
D If the Defending Player loses the Battle, their Hero does not incur any loss of Power. They only lose their Stronghold.
D All other Battle Steps remain the same.


STEP 1 : BATTLEFIELD Carry over Stats (Hero Attack Stat vs
Stronghold Defense Stat). Be sure to account for all Stat bonuses you have acquired, and note that Equipped Items only affect Heroes.

STEP 2 : BATTLE CARDS
.
Declare Battle Cards. Adjust Power Stats and Capital Coins for the cost of using Battle Cards.

STEP 3 : BATTLE ROLL
Players roll the Battle Die. Determine Total Scores. Account for Battle Cards.

STEP 4 : OUTCOME
Determine Outcome, adjust Power Stats and Capital Coins - account for post-Battle bonuses. Discard the used Battle Cards.

Attacker’s Hero Attack Stat + Attacker’s Battle Roll = Attacker’s Total Score (ATS).

Defender’s Stronghold Defense Stat + Defender’s Battle Roll =  Defender’s Total Score (DTS).


ATS - DTS = OUTCOME



IF ATTACKER WINS

CIf the Outcome number is positive (the Attacker has the greater Score), then the Attacking Player has won the Battle and Gains the Stronghold Card by adding it above their Kingdom Mat. Attacker also gains all Capital on that card and adds it to their Kingdom Mat. Both Players adjust any Residual Capital that comes with the
Stronghold. The Defender’s Hero does NOT lose any Power. The Defender simply loses their Stronghold, its benefits, and all capital on the card.
CIf you have any post-Battle bonuses, remember to take them into account, and then Discard used Battle Cards.

IF DEFENDER WINS

CIf the Outcome number is negative (the Defender has the greater Score), then the Defending Player has won the Battle and keeps their Stronghold. The Attacking Hero takes the difference in Scores as an amount of Damage to their Hero’s Power Stat. The Attacker adjusts their Power Stat accordingly using the DRY ERASE marker.
CIf you have any post-Battle bonuses, remember to take them into account, and then Discard used Battle Cards.

TIES GO TO THE ATTACKER C In the event of a Tie (ATS = DTS),
then the Attacker wins the Battle and takes the Stronghold.
