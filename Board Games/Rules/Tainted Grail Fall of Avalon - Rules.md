# Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon - Rules
#### SETUP

Choose story, standard, or challenge game mode. You may change
the mode between chapters. Take the corresponding help card if
you chose story or challenge mode.

Each player chooses a character and takes their tile and a
character tray of the same color (or any color for Niamh). Mark your

#### starting energy and terror levels by placing cubes in their

#### starting slots. Place the T-shaped health marker in its starting

slot (starting slots are highlighted with 2 red chevrons).

Record your starting attributes, as noted on the back of your
character tile. Record your starting resources, also noted on the
back of your character tile, by placing the corresponding numbers
of cubes in the resource slots on your character tray.

Set aside the 80 combat and diplomacy cards that match the color
of your character tray (there are 50 basic combat and diplomacy
cards that match your character tray, and 30 advanced combat
and diplomacy cards with your character’s name above their title).

Pick the 15 basic combat and the 15 basic diplomacy cards with a
banner that matches your tray’s color. Shuffle them and place them
to the left (combat) and right (diplomacy) of your character tray.

Characters from other campaigns must refer to the starter deck
lists found on the back of their character tile. In the Fall of Avalon
campaign, the starter cards used are numbered 1-15/25. Starter
cards do not have character names on them.

Take the 15 advanced combat cards (they have your character’s
name on them), then the 10 remaining basic combat cards of the
color matching your character tray (the ones without the banner,
that weren’t used to create your starter deck). Shuffle these 15
advanced cards with the 10 basic cards to form your 25 card
combat advancement pool. Repeat these steps with the diplomacy
cards to build your diplomacy advancement pool. Place both
advancement pools in one of the save compartments in the box or
cover them with the Advancement Pool cards.

Place your character tile on the character tray (character actions
faceup). Read your character’s introductory letter (this also gives
you your character number, used to break ties and unresolved
votes). Take your adventure map.

Place the starting location card in the middle of the play area and
place your character models on it. The starting location for The Fall
of Avalon campaign is ##101; others use ##201, ##301, and ##401.

Place 1 menhir model on the starting location and put a dial in the
slot under it. Turn the dial so that it shows 8 (for 1 player), 7 (for 2
players), 6 (for 3 players) or 5 (for 4 players).

Find the 4 location cards with the location numbers corresponding
to the 4 direction keys on the 4 edges of your starting card and
place each of them next to its matching key.

Take all the encounter cards and sort them by color into 4 piles.
Each pile should contain 31 cards, including a special encounter
marked ‘your first encounter’.

Shuffle the item cards and sort the secret cards by number. Place
both decks next to the encounters.

Take a fresh save sheet. This is used to save your game and to mark
statuses that permanently change the way some locations and
people respond to your group.

Each player should takes 1 icon guide card and 1 turn order card
with the action list on the back. Leave the combat / diplomacy help
card on the table.

```
Optionally, choose one player to be the chronicler to maintain the
flow of the game (recommended in coop games with 2-4 players).
The chronicler is responsible for reading (or re-telling) paragraphs
of the exploration journal aloud to other players; performing upkeep
tasks, such as revealing new event cards and reducing all dials at the
start of the day; maintaining the save sheet, marking any statuses
gained by players, and checking the statuses when asked; adding
new location cards and removing location cards no longer in a range
of an active menhir; dealing item and secret cards from their decks;
and breaking ties and making the final decision in any conflict.
Follow the instructions on the chapter I setup card, starting from
the front side, to build the event deck and encounter decks.
Shuffle the random event cards and place them to the side of
your play area or in the box. The event cards may ask you to put a
certain number of these random events on top of the event deck
(always draw from the deck, never from the random event pile).
When you discard a location, random event, encounter, secret, or
item card, place it on the bottom of its deck. The event deck has
its own discard pile. Shuffle discarded or destroyed combat and
diplomacy cards back into your combat or diplomacy deck when
the encounter ends.
If you must remove a card from the game, it is no longer a part of
the campaign and should not return to any deck, unless you’re
specifically instructed otherwise.
```
```
Global: If a secret card has this keyword, its rules apply to each
character.
```
#### THE ORDER OF THE DAY

## 1. START OF THE DAY

```
Skip this sequence on the first day of the campaign.
```
1. Resolve start of day effects: Characters with any effects that
should be resolved now are resolved in any chosen order.
2. Remove expired menhirs: If a menhir has no dial in the slot of its
base, it becomes inactive: remove it from the table. Any menhirs
still on the table are active menhirs.
3. Remove locations out of menhir range: Each location card
should be adjacent (in a straight line or diagonally) to a location
with an active menhir. Discard any location cards that are not.

```
All characters on a location card removed in this way immediately
lose 2 , gain 2 , and are moved to the nearest remaining
location card (if there are several the same distance away, choose
the lowest-numbered one). This is not a travel action. All other
components, including guardians, are discarded.
```
4. Reduce menhir dials: Reduce the dial of each active menhir by 1.
If it was already at 1, remove the dial from under the menhir. The
menhir itself won’t disappear or become inactive until the next
START OF THE DAY.
5. Reduce time dials and remove time tokens: If there are any dials
with time tokens on them, including on the secret cards or next to
characters, reduce them by 1. If a dial can no longer be reduced,
remove it from the game.
Remove 1 time token from every location card that has any on it.
Do not remove any quest tokens from any location.
6. Move guardians: If there are any guardians on the table, roll the
direction die for each and move them.
7. Reveal and read a new event card: If it has quest text and a
red padlock symbol, move it to the quest pile, next to the event
deck. Unlike regular events that stay active for 1 day, quest events
remain on the table until specified.
8. Discuss your plans: If you are playing co-op, all players should
take time to discuss their plans.
9. Equip for your journey: Make sure your character doesn’t have
more than 1 item with the same keyword faceup. Flip any excess
items facedown.

## 2. DURING THE DAY

```
Each player performs 1 action, in any order players agree on. If
they cannot agree, the character with the lowest character number
goes first. Each action in the game is marked with an action icon
that also indicates its cost in energy.
A group of 2 or more players sharing the same location may agree
to take the same action together, at the same time, as a party.
Once every player has performed 1 action or taken part in 1 party
action or passed, players once again perform 1 action each. This
```
#### continues until all characters have passed or run out of , when

```
players proceed to the END OF THE DAY.
```
#### EXPLORE (COST 1 )

```
Flip your current location card and read the text. Some cards are
self-contained, and some refer to the exploration journal. Continue
exploration in the journal until you reach exploration ends. Then flip
the location card back and continue the game.
If you don’t want to flip the card, every location in the exploration
journal starts with the same text that is on the back of the card.
```
#### In a party: The cost of exploration is 1 per party member. Most

```
effects apply to every character in the party, but rewards will
usually have to be shared.
```
#### TRAVEL (COST 1 )

```
Move your character to any location card connected to your current
one. The adjacent edges must share the same direction keys. Move
only in straight lines; no diagonal travel is allowed.
When you arrive in a new location:
```
1. Find the cards that match the direction keys on the edges of
    your new location. Attach them to the corresponding keys if
    the card you are trying to attach is no further than 1 card away
    (including diagonally) from an active menhir.
2. If a guardian is present in the location, resolve the encounter.
3. Check whether the new location has an instant action.
    Any rule marked with must be resolved now.

#### In a party: The cost of travel is 1 per party member. Any

```
automatic action or guardian encounter triggered by your new
location must be resolved as a party.
```
#### LOCATION (COST? )

```
See the cost on the location card. You may activate the action on
a location card whenever you are present in the location and not
involved in some other action.
```
```
When you perform an action marked once per day, cover its icon
with a time token to indicate it has been used. Some locations track
other rules with time tokens.
```
```
In a party: You may activate a location action as a party. Pay the
cost only once and receive the output of the action once. Players
in the party may help each other pay costs, splitting them any way
they want; if they trigger an encounter, they resolve it as a party.
```
#### CHARACTER (COST? )

```
Every character has a personal action on their character tile which
can only be activated outside of encounters and exploration.
```
```
In a party: Only your character can use your character action, but
party members may help pay the cost. The character performing
the action must always pay at least 1.
```
#### INSPECT A MENHIR (COST 0 )

```
If the location you are in has a menhir seal next to its name,
it contains a menhir. You may inspect the menhir for free by
flipping the location card and reading the menhir section at
the bottom. If you have the required resources and meet all criteria,
you may activate the menhir.
```
```
Activating menhirs is only possible in locations that have the
menhir seal next to their name. All costs of activating a menhir
scale up with the total number of players in the game. If you don’t
want to flip the card, all menhir information is in the corresponding
location in the exploration journal.
```
#### PASS (COST 0 )

#### You may pass even if you have unspent , but once you’ve

```
passed, you cannot take any more actions until the next day.
```
## 3. END OF THE DAY

#### When all characters have passed or run out , every character

```
performs these steps:
```
1. Resolve end of day effects: Characters with any effects that
should be resolved now are resolved in any chosen order.

#### 2. Rest: You may pay 1 food. If you do, gain 1 and lose 1.

3. Restore your energy: Return the marker on your track to the
starting slot. If you’re exhausted (your marker is in one of the last 2
red slots), restore only 4 points of. Your marker can never be
moved past your marker.
4. Advance your character: You may spend any of your EXP points
to raise your attributes, gain new skills or add new combat and
diplomacy cards to your deck.
5. Build your character decks: You may customize your combat
and diplomacy decks with any cards you have gained from the
advancement pool. You can also remove any, but your deck must
consist of 15 cards.
    6. Experience dreams: If the location you’re in has a dream
    icon, open the appropriate section of the exploration

#### journal and read the dream. If your marker is on one of

```
the red slots (ie, the You Are Going Insane card is attached to your
character tray), read the nightmare instead.
All characters in a location resolve dreams as a party. All characters
going insane in a location resolve nightmares as a party.
```
#### CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES

```
Your character is defined by 6 basic attributes, divided into 3
opposing pairs. After you raise any attribute to 2, every subsequent
point of that attribute provides a special skill card that attaches to
the side of your character tray next to the attribute.
```
```
Aggression Empathy Courage
```
```
Caution Practicality Spirituality
```
#### RESOURCES

#### FOOD At each END OF THE DAY, your character should eat 1

#### unit of food. Without food, you cannot regenerate.

#### WEALTH Gold, gems and other riches can help you buy

#### life-saving items and equipment.

```
Food and wealth may be traded with party members or any other
characters in the same location who are not involved in an action.
```
#### REPUTATION (REP) Fame and glory; if you have many

#### REP points, people will go out of their way to help you.

#### MAGIC Supernatural power may help you during

#### encounters, and is often required to enable menhirs.

#### EXPERIENCE (EXP) Spent on raising your attributes and

#### buying new combat and diplomacy cards.

```
You cannot carry more than 20 of each resource (except EXP).
```
#### LOCATIONS

```
Location cards make up the map of Avalon. The location number
refers to the corresponding location in the exploration journal. Each
location card may have up to 3 location seals:
```
```
Menhir: The location contains a menhir you can activate.
```
```
Dreams: If you end your day in this location, dreams or
nightmares come to you in your sleep.
```
```
Friendly/unfriendly settlement: This location triggers
an encounter as soon as you enter it.
```

###### SPECIAL MOVEMENT

Some cards and effects ask you to move your character to the
‘lowest-numbered revealed location’, ‘any connected location’, etc.
This special move does not count as travel, costs nothing, and is
performed instantly. It does however reveal further location cards
and trigger any instant actions and guardian encounters.

###### LEGACY LOCATION NUMBERS

When location cards change, their number also changes, since
they receive a new section in the exploration journal. The original
location number (the legacy location number) can still be found on
the card; use it when connecting the direction keys.

When you visit any location, if the location card with a number
indicated by the direction key is no longer available in the game,
check the legacy location number instead.

###### MENHIRS

You may extend the remaining duration of an active menhir by
activating it again. Any remaining power left on the dial is lost at the
moment of new activation, and you do not add a new menhir model
in the location.

If the last menhir on the map goes out, do not remove the last
remaining location cards. The characters may continue to play in
these locations, but they lose 2 and gain 2 at each START OF
THE DAY until they die or activate one of the menhirs.

#### QUESTS AND TASKS

Quests are the main missions that lead to the end of the chapter
and let you progress through the campaign. They are on either
event or secret cards and are marked by a red padlock symbol.
Whenever you draw a card with a quest, read it and place it in the
active quests pile, next to the event deck. Never remove any cards
with a quest unless you’re instructed to do so.

Tasks are small side missions or clues you may choose to pursue.
They have no separate cards and no defined end conditions. They
are not tied to the chapter and may be completed at any point (until
your actions permanently change the location card they are on).
Consider taking notes whenever you get a new task.

#### PARTIES AND PARTY ACTIONS

Players may form a group or split up as they see fit. Whenever any
character takes any action, other characters in the same location
may decide to join them. If the character performing the action
agrees, all characters form a party and take the action together.

All characters in a party are referred to as party members. Party
members can trade food, wealth, items and secrets at any time, as
long as the party is not involved in an encounter.

If you’re in a party with another character, you may spend your
or MAGIC instead of another party member, and may even cover the
entire cost of the action for all the other party members. However,
when performing their character action on their character tray, the
active character must always spend at least 1.

Joining an action is possible only before it begins. Once the action
begins, characters can no longer form or disband a party, unless
specified otherwise.

###### LEAVING OR DISBANDING A PARTY

Each party action needs to be taken and approved by all party
members. Any character not wanting to take a specific action with
the rest of the party must leave the party before the action begins.

You may not leave a party in the middle of an action. You may leave
a party anytime it is not resolving an action.

When a character in a party cannot pay the action cost required
for each party member, they are dropped out of the party and the
remaining characters proceed with the action.

Party members may only leave during combat and diplomacy if
they escape from the encounter or are removed due to the effect of
the You Are Dying card.

#### STATUSES AND SAVE SHEET

```
As you travel, complete quests and solve tasks, you will be asked to
mark a certain status (or a numbered part of the status) on the save
sheet. Statuses are story triggers, and are not personal: if there’s a
status marked on a save sheet, all characters have it.
```
#### ENCOUNTERS

```
The green deck is mostly used in the wild and contains natural
threats such as wild animals or legendary beasts. Many of these
encounters grant food when defeated.
```
```
The gray deck contains dangers related to the world of men, such
as brigands, rogue knights, or people driven to insanity. Many of
these encounters grant items when defeated.
```
```
The purple deck contains mysterious and supernatural threats.
```
```
The blue deck is a special non-combat deck. It is used mostly
when you visit an unfriendly settlement and it contains dangerous
situations, as well as personal and diplomatic challenges.
```
```
Cards in each of these decks are divided into 4 difficulty levels.
Drawing an encounter immediately launches you and your party
into combat or diplomacy, depending on the encounter card.
```
#### GUARDIANS

```
If you fail to defeat a guardian encounter, place its card on the
location where you triggered it. At the start of each day, roll a
guardian die:
```
1. Cardinal direction: Move the guardian accordingly.
2. Nothing: The guardian does not move.
3. Discard: Remove the guardian from play (return its card to the
    bottom of its encounter deck).
If the guardian moves to an unrevealed or unconnected location,
move it to the highest-numbered connected location instead.
If the guardian stays in the same location and there are any
characters there, immediately start the encounter (all characters
present in the location must fight together).

```
If the guardian enters a location with any character, or vice versa,
immediately start the encounter. If there’s more than 1 guardian
there, players may choose which encounter to trigger first. Once
the guardian is defeated, put its card on the bottom of its deck.
If a character or a party enters a location with a guardian and an
instant action , trigger the guardian encounter first and then
resolve the instant action.
```
```
If there are more encounters of a certain type on the board than
available models, use cards to represent any excess encounters.
```
#### ITEMS, EQUIPMENT AND SECRETS

```
Some item cards bear one of these keywords: WEAPON, ARMOR,
SHIELD, COMPANION, and RELIC. You can have any number of items,
but you may never use more than 1 item or secret with a single
keyword at the same time.
```
```
At the START OF THE DAY, if you have several items or secrets with
the same keyword, decide which you will use and turn the others
facedown. Do the same each time you get a new item or secret with
the same keyword as another of your faceup items or secrets.
Items with a C are craftable items. If a crafting action or an
encounter reward asks you to ‘draw a craftable item’, keep drawing
cards from the item deck until you find the first item with a C. Take
it and shuffle the rest of the item deck. A similar process applies for
drawing a ‘companion item’, ‘weapon item’ etc.
```
```
Characters may freely trade items when they are in the same
location and they’re not involved in an action or encounter.
```
```
If an item instructs you to flip the card in combat or diplomacy (to
indicate it has been used), turn it facedown. At the end of your
combat or diplomacy, flip the card back faceup.
```
```
Secrets are story related, numbered objects and powers that are
never part of the standard item deck. They may never be lost or
sold, unless specified otherwise, and are not affected by any rules
that limit your number of items.
```
```
If an effect asks you to discard item cards, omit any secrets, even if
they have an item-specific keyword.
```
```
Players may trade secret cards between their characters whenever
they are in the same location and not involved in an action. The
exception are cards with the PERSONAL keyword, which may never
be transferred to another character.
```
#### CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT

```
EXP can be spent at each END OF THE DAY to raise your attributes,
gain additional combat or diplomacy cards, or gain skills.
```
###### ADVANCING COMBAT/DIPLOMACY DECKS

```
Pay 2 EXP. Take 3 cards from the top of your advancement pool,
pick 1 of them, and add it to your deck. Shuffle the 2 remaining
cards back into your advancement pool.
Your combat and diplomacy decks must always contain at least
15 cards each.
```
```
You can swap cards you own in and out of your deck at each END
OF THE DAY. The cards that are not in your deck at the moment
do not return to the advancement pool; place them next to your
character tray or in the save compartment of your character.
```
###### ADVANCING ATTRIBUTES

```
The cost of raising attributes depends on the total value of the
attribute pair:
2 EXP: 1st point in a pair of opposing attributes.
4 EXP: 2nd point in a pair of opposing attributes.
```
```
6 EXP: 3rd point in a pair of opposing attributes.
8 EXP: 4th point in a pair of opposing attributes.
10 EXP: 5th and any further points in a pair of opposing
attributes.
```
###### BUYING SKILLS

```
Whenever you earn a 3rd (or any subsequent) point in any
single attribute, attach a skill card bearing that attribute to the
appropriate edge of your character tray. Whenever you gain a skill,
you must choose one side and forfeit the other. Every skill card has
a point of its attribute printed on its face.
```
#### DEATH AND INSANITY

```
If your falls to 0 on your health track, attach the You Are Dying
card to your character tray, immediately escape any current
encounter, and resolve all additional rules on the card.
```
###### DEATH

```
In single player mode, the game ends when your character dies.
In cooperative mode, your death does not end the game. Instead,
follow these steps:
```
1. If there’s an unclaimed character left in the box, you may claim
    this character, perform standard character setup, then place
    your model in the lowest-numbered revealed location.
2. Place all the dead character’s items on the location where the
    character died. They may be picked up by any other players until
    the location disappears.
3. Split all the secrets belonging to the dead character between
    the other characters in any way the owner of the dead character
    wishes. Secrets with the PERSONAL keyword disappear forever
    when their owner is killed.
If all other characters are either in use or dead when a character
dies, the game ends in failure, even for characters still alive.

###### INSANITY

```
If your reaches the 2 top red slots of your track, attach the You
Are Going Insane card to your character tray and follow its rules.
```
###### ALLMOTHER’S MERCY

```
If you and your party perish and do not wish to start again, you may
decide that the intervention of the Allmother saved you. Mark the
status Saved by the goddess on your save sheet and go to verse 500
in the Book of Secrets. This will restart you at the beginning of the
chapter with some pre-defined resources.
```
#### SAVING THE GAME

```
Save your game and store it only after completing a chapter, when
the journal or event card gives you such an option. However, in
emergency situations, you may save the game at any time.
```
###### EACH PLAYER SAVES THE STATE OF THEIR

###### CHARACTER:

1. Pick 1 character tray diagram on the save sheet. Sign it with your
    character’s name. Then use a pencil to mark your attributes, the
    numbers of your resources, and the state of your survival tracks
    on the diagram.
2. If you have any skills, write their unique numbers next to the
    attribute they attach to.
3. Write down any additional important information, such as the
    state of the quest dials or secret card dials (if you have any).
4. Store all markers from your character tray in the box.
5. Put all your items and secrets in one of the 4 save compartments
    in the box.
6. Stack all your diplomacy cards with all your combat cards. Put
    the advancement pool separator cards on top of your combat
    and diplomacy advancement pools and stack them together. Put
    both stacks in your save compartment.

###### ALL PLAYERS SAVE THE STATE OF THE WORLD:

1. Use your save sheet to note the current location of all character
    models, guardian models, menhir models, and special dials, as
    well as the current value of each dial.
2. Place all models, dials and tokens in the box.
3. Stack all revealed locations into a pile and place the revealed
    locations separator card on top of them. Then, add the
    unrevealed locations to the pile, facing the other way. Place all
    location cards in the oversized cards compartment of the box.
    Ensure that any locations you’ve removed from the game are
    stored separately, in the other, smaller compartment.
4. Store all 4 of your current encounter decks in the box, behind the
    saved encounters separator card.
5. Store your event deck and any active quests in the box, behind
    the saved events separator card.
6. Place any remaining cards (unused secrets, items, encounters or
    events) in the box.

```
To restore a saved game, reverse this process.
```
#### ADDING OR REMOVING PLAYERS

```
Every time you set up a new game session, you may add or remove
players and characters (within the 1-4 characters limit).
```
```
Distribute any secret cards in possession of any removed
characters to characters who remain in the game. Secrets should
never be removed from the campaign in progress unless you are
specifically asked to do so.
```
```
Place any fresh characters in the same location as one of the
veteran characters. They are the reinforcements you receive
from Cuanacht and begin the game with their standard starting
resources and decks.
```

#### STORY MODE

###### STARTING ITEMS

When setting up the items deck during setup, each character
draws and gains 1 random craftable item.

###### ENCOUNTERS SETUP

Perform setup of the encounter decks at the start of all chapters
as if you had 1 less person in your party. You may stop this at
any point.

###### HEALTH LIMITER

Remove the limiter plastic piece from the game, and mark
with a regular marker instead. Your no longer limits your
and you won’t panic in combat or diplomacy.

###### MENHIRS COST

Treat all menhir activation costs as if they had 1 chosen type
of resource requirement less. (eg, instead of paying and
2 wealth per player, pay either per player or 2 wealth per
player). This may result in activating menhir for free. Menhir
special requirements still apply.

#### CHALLENGE MODE

To increase the difficulty, use these rule modifications. For an
intermediate experience, apply only some of these changes.

###### SETUP

Each player flips their limiter plastic piece upside down so
the top of the heart icon points to the bottom of the track. This

###### makes all players more susceptible to panic and loss caused

by damage, making wounds even more realistic, and limits self-
recovery, requiring better teamwork and risk management.

Take secret card 42 at the start of the game.

###### ESCAPING COMBAT

You may try to escape only once per your character’s activation.
To initiate an escape, lose 1 , then receive an opportunity
attack and toss a dial:

```
Skull: You remain in combat.
Grail: You successfully escape from combat. If you were the
last character in combat, place the encounter card on the
bottom of its deck, and reshuffle your combat deck, including
any discarded cards.
```
###### MENHIRS & EVENTS

```
When activated, all menhirs have their duration reduced by
1 day.
When the game requires you to place any random event cards,

#### DIPLOMACY AND COMBAT

Diplomacy starts whenever you must draw or pick
a card from the blue encounter deck, and the card
has at least 1 open key on its right edge. Set the
card in the play area.

Combat starts whenever you must draw or pick
a card from the gray, green, or purple encounter
decks, and the card has at least 1 open key on its
right edge. Set the card in the play area. Check to
see if the enemy has a trait that takes effect now.

All party members now ensure they’re not using
more than 1 item with each keyword (WEAPON,
ARMOR, SHIELD, COMPANION, RELIC). Set aside any
items you do not wish to use; no items may be added
once you enter the encounter.

Each party member then draws a number of cards
from their diplomacy or combat deck: 3 (1-
characters in the encounter), or 2 (4 characters).
If you don’t like your starting hand, you may discard
it and draw a new hand with 1 fewer card. You may
repeat this until you only have 1 card left in hand.

#### Whenever you have to discard a card from your

#### hand but you don’t have any, discard a card

#### from the top of your combat or diplomacy deck

#### (as appropriate).

#### DIPLOMACY Place a marker in the gray slot of

the affinity track on the left of the card, and go to
phase I of the diplomacy turn.

#### COMBAT Go to phase 1 of the combat turn.

#### ABILITY TRIGGERS

Abilities on encounter cards usually have a trigger
icon indicating when to resolve them:

```
On placement: Resolve the ability after
placing the card in the sequence.
```
```
Delayed: Put a time token on the card as you
play it. The ability is triggered after removing
the last time token from the card; it does not
trigger on subsequent turns, and the time
token does not return. If you put another
card on a card with a time token, and you
cover the ability, the time token is lost and
the ability will not trigger.
On enemy attack/opponent’s response:
The ability remains active throughout your
activation’s entire step 3.
```
```
Damage: You must lower your by the
indicated amount.
```
```
Connected attribute key: This icon means
the number of connected attribute keys of
this type in the entire sequence.
```
#### BONUSES

Draw a card.

```
This bonus key allows you to play additional
cards during phase 2 (play cards). Ignore
this key when playing your first card in the
activation.
```
This bonus does not multiply (if it’s next to
the multiplier, ignore the multiplier).

```
Discard the last card of your sequence.
```
## 2x Multiplies the next icon.

```
Voids the next icon.
```
#### PANIC

```
You panic when your is higher than your.
Instead of playing the first card of this turn from your
hand in step 2 (play cards) of your activation, play
a card from the top of your combat deck. Then you
may play any additional cards from your hand, as
normal. Do not draw a new card at the end of the
turn. Any bonus or extra cards gained from bonus
keys, skills or abilities are still drawn as normal.
```
#### DIPLOMACY

```
In each diplomacy turn, complete these phases
in order:
```
#### 1. PICK ACTIVE CHARACTER

```
The party members decide who will be the next
active character out of the characters who have
not been activated this combat turn (and therefore
have no time token on their character tray). If they
can’t agree, the character with the lowest character
number becomes active.
```
```
Place a time token on the active character’s tray.
Any effects that happen during the character
activation apply only to the active character.
```
#### 2. CHARACTER ACTIVATION

1. Delayed abilities
Remove 1 time token from each diplomacy card in
the sequence that has any. If you’ve removed the
last time token from a card, immediately resolve its
ability with the time token trigger. These abilities
trigger only once.
2. Play cards
Play cards from your hand and add them to the
sequence:

```
a. Play 1 diplomacy card. When playing the first
card during your activation, you don’t need to
fulfill any special requirements and it does not
need to connect any keys; it just needs to line
properly with the previous card in the sequence.
```
- Red border: Check if any attribute keys
    connect to bonus keys and apply these
    bonuses. For them to connect, your character
    needs to have this specific attribute level.
- Blue border: You may connect this key and
    gain its bonus by paying 1 MAGIC. Place this
    marker on the key to indicate it is active. If you
    have to discard a card with a connected magic
    key, discard the magic marker.
- Orange border: Connect the free key and gain
    its bonus.
- Check the ability: if it triggers now, resolve it.

```
b. Play additional diplomacy cards. Every
diplomacy card you play after your first one must
connect with a key. The icon must appear on
the card you want to play (not the one before),
and become connected. If you have no cards with
this bonus key, or you can find no way to connect
it, you may not play any additional cards. Resolve
any cards you play as above.
```
```
c. Perform the affinity check. Check the position of
the marker on the affinity track:
```
- If it’s on the lowest slot, you lose the encounter:
    apply the failure rules to each party member,
    and put the encounter on the bottom of its
    deck. Then reshuffle your diplomacy deck.
- If it’s on the highest slot, you win the current
    stage of the encounter. If this was the last stage,
    you win the entire encounter: receive rewards,
    place the encounter card on the bottom of its
    deck, then reshuffle your diplomacy deck. If
    this wasn’t the last stage, begin the next stage:
    move the marker to the gray slot on the affinity
    track, place a marker on the completed stage,
    and go to step 4 (check readiness).
3. Opponent’s response
Find the response for the current stage of this
encounter on the encounter card, and apply it to
the active character order from left to right. Then,
perform the affinity check.
4. Check readiness
Check if all of the party members have been
activated this turn (and have time tokens on their
character trays).

```
If there are none left to activate, proceed to phase
3 (end turn). If there are still characters yet to be
activated, return to phase 1 (pick active character).
```
#### 3. END TURN

```
Discard: Each party member discards down to 3
cards in their hand.
Draw: All party members draw 1 card from their
decks. Do not draw if your character panics.
Clear activations: Remove all time tokens from the
character trays.
Return to the start of phase I (pick active character).
```
#### DIPLOMACY RULES

#### ADDITIONAL DIPLOMACY BONUSES

```
Move the marker up or down the affinity
track.
Check the description of the current stage
on the encounter card to see if it has a rule
corresponding to the attribute connected to
this bonus.
```
#### NO CARDS IN DECK

```
Whenever you have to draw any diplomacy cards
and your diplomacy deck does not have the required
number of cards, you lose the encounter. Apply the
failure rules on the encounter card.
```
#### DYING

```
When your drops to 0, take a You Are Dying
card. Among other rules, the card ends the current
encounter.
```
#### ESCAPING/AVOIDING DIPLOMACY

```
You may always escape a diplomatic encounter by
applying the penalty in the card’s failure section.
```
```
If the card has an avoid section, you may bypass the
encounter by resolving all costs and requirements
in that section. Then put the card at the bottom
of the blue encounter deck. You can only avoid an
encounter before you begin diplomacy with it.
```
```
In a party: When avoiding, always check the
highest REP or attribute levels (do not total them).
The cost of avoidance or failure applies to each
party member separately. If party members can’t
reach a unanimous decision, they must resolve the
encounter.

#### COMBAT

In each combat turn, complete these phases in
order:

#### 1. PICK ACTIVE CHARACTER

The party members decide who will be the next
active character out of the characters who have
not been activated this combat turn (and therefore
have no time token on their character tray). If they
can’t agree, the character with the lowest character
number becomes active.

Place a time token on the active character’s tray.
Any effects that happen during the character
activation apply only to the active character.

#### 2. CHARACTER ACTIVATION

1. Delayed abilities
Remove 1 time token from each combat card in
the sequence that has any. If you’ve removed the
last time token from a card, immediately resolve its
ability with the time token trigger. These abilities
trigger only once.
2. Play cards
Play cards from your hand and add them to the
sequence:

a. Play 1 combat card. When playing the first card
during your activation, you don’t need to fulfill
any special requirements and it does not need to
connect any keys; it just needs to line properly
with the previous card in the sequence.

- Red border: Check if any attribute keys
    connect to bonus keys and apply these
    bonuses. For them to connect, you need to
    have this specific attribute level.
- Blue border: You may connect this key and
    gain its bonus by paying 1 MAGIC. Place this
    marker on the key to indicate it is active. If you
    have to discard a card with a connected magic
    key, discard the magic marker.
- Orange border: Connect the free key and gain
    its bonus.
- Check the ability: if it triggers now, resolve it.

b. Play additional combat cards. Every combat card
you play after your first one must connect with
a key. The icon must appear on the card you
want to play (not the one before), and become
connected. If you have no cards that have this
bonus key, or you can find no way to connect it,
you may not play any additional cards. Resolve
any cards you play as above.

c. Check for opportunity attack. If you haven’t
played a single card this activation, the enemy
immediately makes an opportunity attack.
Afterwards, draw 1 card.

d. Perform the victory check. Count the number of
markers in the combat pool. If it’s higher than or
equal to the target value on the encounter card,
you win. Receive any rewards, share any loot, and
place the encounter card on the bottom of its
deck; then reshuffle your combat deck, including
any played and discarded cards.

Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

3. Enemy attack
Find the attack on the encounter card that matches
the number of markers in the combat pool. Apply
the result of this attack to the active character in
order from left to right.
After modifying the combat pool, perform the
victory check.
4. Check readiness
Check if all of the party members have been
activated this turn (and have time tokens on their
character trays). If there are none left to activate,
proceed to phase 3 (end turn). If there are still
characters yet to be activated, return to phase 1
(pick active character).

#### 3. END TURN

```
Discard: Discard down to 3 cards in your hand.
Draw: All party members draw 1 card from their
decks. Do not draw if your character panics.
Clear activations: Remove all time tokens from the
character trays.
Return to the start of phase I (pick the active
character).
```
## COMBAT RULES

#### ADDITIONAL COMBAT BONUSES

```
Place that many markers in the combat pool.^
```
#### CHARGES

```
Some cards instruct you to gain charges; place
universal markers on the card. You can use Pay X
Charges abilities any time you want (unless their text
restricts them to a phase).
In a party: Only the active character can use charges
from cards, but the owner of the card must agree.
```
#### NEGATIVE COMBAT POOL

```
The combat pool can never become negative.
Whenever an enemy attack or another effect asks
you to remove a marker from the combat pool, but
there are not enough markers, the player controlling
the active character discards a card from their hand
for every excess point instead.
```
#### NO CARDS IN DECK

```
Whenever you have to draw any combat cards
and your combat deck does not have the required
number of cards, you are forced to escape.
```
#### OPPORTUNITY

```
If you play no cards in step 2 of your activation, your
enemy immediately performs the opportunity attack
listed on their card, and you draw 1 extra card. Then,
proceed to step 3 (enemy attack).
```
#### PASSIVE COMBAT CARDS

```
These have their ability always visible when in
sequence: their keys are on the opposite edges of
the card.
```
#### RUN AWAY

```
Some creatures have a special Run Away attack.
When it triggers, immediately end the encounter and
put the encounter card at the bottom of its deck.
Characters receive no loot or reward. Forcing the
enemy to run away doesn’t count as winning the
encounter.
```
#### DYING

```
When your drops to 0, take a You Are Dying card.
Among other rules, the card immediately removes
you from the current encounter.
```

card.
```
## ESCAPING COMBAT

```
#### by losing 1 and triggering the opportunity attack

```
on the encounter card. Then place the encounter
card on the bottom of its deck and reshuffle your
combat deck.
```
```
In a party: The rest of the party remains in the
encounter and proceeds to step 4 (check readiness).
When all players escape, place the encounter card
on the bottom of its deck.
