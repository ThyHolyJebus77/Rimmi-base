## Factions/Civilizations
- The game features five empires (Bear, Lion, Horse, Elephant, Eagle), but players don't directly control these
- Players represent secret societies (Spider, Rat, Raven, Serpent) with no inherent gameplay differences

*Note: The secret societies are thematic and don't have mechanical differences. The key strategic element is the players' hidden and changing loyalties to the five empires.*

# War of Whispers - Rules

```
Five mighty empires are at war for the world.
Their banners flying boldly, they march towards glory.
The ferocity of the Bear. The pride of the Lion. The endurance of the Horse.
The reach of the Eagle. The power of the Elephant.
```
**Come the dawn, the world will be remade, and one empire will rule over them all...**

```
But it is in the shadows that true power lies... a Serpent, a Spider, a Raven, a Rat.
This is not a war for the mighty, with battles waged on the open field.
This is a war fought by empires unseen—a war of whispers.
```

#### THE SUPPLICANT

#### SPIDER

_They walk the halls of
power as lowly servants, heads down,
unfeared and unloved. They are spiders
hidden in high corners, spinning a web in
service to no king or lord, but in service of
the downtrodden and forgotten._

#### THE CULT

#### OF THE RAT

_A mysterious new religion
has arisen among the royal families of
the five great empires. The Cult of the Rat
tempts the rich and powerful to join their
feast, and of course to contribute their
worldly goods and influence._

#### THE PALE RAVEN

_Empires rise and fall, but
the everlasting and growing
knowledge of the Pale Raven
endures. It is a wise ruler that would
seek such sure counsel. The Pale Raven
seeks no reward but that their knowledge
survives and grows._

#### THE ENDLESS

#### SERPENT

_The followers of the Endless
Serpent encircle the globe. The Serpent
often takes a more physical approach to
coercion. The goals of the Serpent are many,
and seemingly not all nefarious, but no
outsider can make head or tails of them._


## OVERVIEW

_A War of Whispers_ is a competitive board
game for 2 to 4 players. Five mighty
empires are at war for the world, but you
are no mighty ruler. Instead, you’ll be
playing a secret society who is betting
on the results of this war while pulling
strings to rig the results and ensure your
bets pay off. _A War of Whispers_ is a game
of deep strategy, hidden agendas, and
shifting loyalties.

## COMPONENTS

## GOAL

You start the game with 5 loyalty
tokens, each corresponding to one
of the 5 different empires. You will
bet randomly on a loyalty value. Your
primary goal is to ensure that when the
game ends, the empires you are most
loyal to control the most cities across
the globe.

(8 x 5 kinds)
```
### 4 Player Boards

### 36 Agent Tokens

```
(9 x 4 kinds)
```
### 20 Loyalty Tokens

## SETUP

## Player Boards and Tokens

To start the game, each player chooses
a matching **player board** (A), set of
**agents** (B), and **loyalty tokens** (C),
and sets them aside. Place the “1” turn
marker beside the “Start” space on
the board (D) and the other three turn
markers near the turn tracker (E).

## The Five Empires

Once that is done, it’s time to set up the
empires. There are 5 **empires** in the
game, each represented by a different
color and animal: The Bear empire (blue),
The Lion empire (yellow), The Horse
empire (brown), The Elephant empire
(green), and the Eagle empire (red).

For each empire, place all **banners**
(cubes) of that color beside the board in
a pile near their associated councils to
create the banner reserve piles (F).

The **empire cards** are then split into 5
**empire decks** and placed beside each
of the corresponding empires (G).

## The Map

The map on the game board is broken
down into different colored **empires**
which are further broken down into
regions. If any region on the map
contains a small banner image, it
indicates that a banner of the color
matching this empire should be placed
there. For example, a yellow region
with two yellow banner images receives
two yellow Lion empire banners.

## First Player

```
Determine which player will go first
by any means. That player takes the
first player marker (J). The first player
marker will change hands throughout
the game, and the player who holds it
will be referred to as the first player.
```
## Loyalty

```
During setup, you and your opponents
will each need to place your initial
loyalty bets on the five empires. To do
so, shuffle your five loyalty tokens and
randomly place them face-down on
the five indicated loyalty slots on your
player board. After placing your bets
you may peek at them, and may do
so at any time during the game. Each
loyalty token represents a bet on one
of the five empires. Loyalty tokens and
scoring are described in detail on page 8.
```
## MAP SYMBOLS

```
Farm: Referred to in council
position actions. Expands the
supply limits in a region to 6.
```
```
Fort: Referred to in council position
actions. Adds 1 banner to the defending
army during an attack.
```
```
City: Referred to in final scoring. See
page 8, Loyalty Tokens and Scoring.
```
```
Banner: Marks the regions an
empire’s starting banners are added to
before the game begins.

## LOYALTY TOKENS

## AND SCORING

Loyalty tokens are your primary means
of winning the game.

You have a total of five loyalty tokens,
one for each empire. You also have
five loyalty slots on your player board:
Devout (x4), Dutiful (x3), Affiliated (x2),
Unallied (x0), and Opposed (x-1).

Your loyalty tokens will score you
points at the end of the game by
multiplying the number of cities the
corresponding empire controls at the
end of the game by how loyal you were
to that empire.

```
Example: At the end of the game, your loyalty
tokens are flipped to reveal their empire side.
If your Elephant loyalty token is placed on
the Dutiful loyalty slot and the Elephant
empire ends the game with 3 cities, your bet on
Elephant will earn you 9 points at the end of
the game (3 cities x 3 loyalty = 9 points).
```
```
In the below graphic, the score for each of your
loyalty tokens would be:
```
```
Lion: 4 loyalty x 2 cities = 8 points
Elephant: 3 loyalty x 3 cities = 9 points
Bear: 2 loyalty x 1 cities = 2 points
Eagle: 0 loyalty x 4 cities = 0 points
Horse: -1 loyalty x 2 cities = -2 points
```
```
Your total score would be 17 (8 + 9 + 2 + 0 - 2).
```

## GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW

Gameplay consists of turns broken
down into four phases:

**1. Deploy Agents Phase:** In player
order, starting with the first player and
proceeding clockwise, each player
removes (except for the first turn)
and then deploys agents to **empire
councils,** the positions on the board
marked Sheriff, Steward, Marshal, and
Chancellor.
**2. Empire Turns Phase:** Each empire’s
**council position** takes an action.
**3. Cleanup Phase:** Add the turn marker
to the next space on the turn tracker,
then each player discards down to the
hand limit of 5 cards.
**4. Swap Phase:** In player order, each
player may swap 2 of their unrevealed
loyalty tokens. If you choose to do so,
you must reveal both of the swapped
loyalty tokens. They remain revealed
for the rest of the game.

The flow of these phases can be seen
by following the arrows around the
perimeter of the board. They flow from
the Deploy Agents space on the board,
onward to each of the council positions,
to the turn tracker, and finally to the
Swap and Reveal Loyalties spaces. You
may move the turn marker piece around
the edge of the board, marking these
spaces to track where you currently are
in the turn.

```
Gameplay will repeat itself in this order
4 times, with the 1st player marker
being passed clockwise after each
time. When the “End Game” space on
the turn track is filled, the game ends
immediately and scoring commences.
```
## DEPLOY AGENTS PHASE

```
Each empire council consists of 4
council positions (Sheriff, Steward,
Marshal, and Chancellor) on which you
can place agents. Starting with the first
player and proceeding clockwise, you
will remove 1 of your agents currently
on the board (if any) and then take
turns placing 1 agent on any open
council position on the board until each
player has placed 2 agents. The effects
and descriptions of these council
positions are detailed in the following
Empire Turns Phase section on page 10.
```
```
2 Player Games: In a 2 player game,
each player places 3 agents instead of 2.
```
```
Agents deployed to the Bear empire’s
Steward and Chancellor positions.
```

## EMPIRE TURNS PHASE

The Empire Turns Phase begins with
the Bear empire’s turn and proceeds
clockwise around the board. During
an empire’s turn, each council position
in that empire’s council will take **one
available action** determined by the
player who controls it, starting with
the Sheriff and following the arrows
up to the Chancellor. Available actions
are described in the Council Positions
section on page 11.

The player who controls a council
position is determined as follows:

- If a council position contains one
of your agents, you control that
council position.
- If a council position contains no
agents, the player who owns the next
agent to its right within this council
will control that council position.
If there are no Agents to its right,
no player will control it and it will
choose to do nothing as its action.

### Empire Control

```
A region is controlled by an empire if
it has at least 1 banner there, or if it is
one of their home regions and contains
no enemy banners. A home region
is a region whose color matches the
empire’s color.
```
```
Example: The Bear empire controls this region
and the city within it.
```
**_Example:_** _The Pale Raven has placed an agent
in the Chancellor position of this council, and
The Endless Serpent has placed an agent on
the Sheriff position. On the empire’s turn, The
Endless Serpent will first get to take an action
for the Sheriff. Since both Steward and Marshal
are empty and The Pale Raven controls the
next agent to the right (Chancellor), The Pale
Raven takes the action of all three positions._

### Controlling Cities

```
At the end of the game, the
number of cities an empire
controls multiplied by a
player’s loyalty to that empire will grant
the player that many points. To control
a city, an empire must simply control
the region the city is in.
```
```
Example: Brown regions are the home regions
of the Horse empire. Because of this, a brown
region with no banners present is controlled
by the Horse empire. However, a brown region
containing a blue banner would be controlled
by the Bear empire.
```

### Council Positions

```
Each council position has one or more
available actions to choose from.
```
##### Add Banner Actions

```
Add 2 banners to any region(s)
controlled by this empire.
```
For each icon present across
all regions controlled by this
empire, add 1 banner to any
region(s) controlled by this empire.

```
For each icon present
across all regions controlled
by this empire, add 1 banner to
any region(s) controlled by this empire.
```
```
For each icon present
across all regions controlled
by this empire, add 2 banners
to any region(s) controlled by this empire.
```
##### Attack Action

```
Attack an enemy army adjacent
to a region controlled by the
active empire (see Attack
Action on page 12 for details). Only one
region may be attacked using this action.
```
##### Draw Empire Card Actions

```
Draw 1 card from this empire’s
deck and add it to your hand.
```
```
For every 2 icons present
across all regions controlled
by this empire, draw 1 card
from this empire’s deck and add it to your
hand.
```
```
For every 3 icons present
across all regions controlled
by this empire, draw 1 card
from this empire’s deck and add it to your
hand.
```
```
For every 2 icons present
across all regions controlled
by this empire, draw 1 card
from this empire’s deck and
add it to your hand.
```
```
For every 3 icons present
across all regions controlled by
this empire, draw 1 card from
this empire’s deck and add it to your hand.
```
##### Swap Agent Action

```
Swap this agent with any other
agent within this council, then
immediately take its action.
(This does not reset the turn.)
```
### Checking Supply

```
A region may only contain 4 banners at
the end of an empire’s turn. If at the end
of the turn there are more than 4 banners,
return banners to the supply until there
are only 4 left. If a region contains a farm,
it has a higher limit of 6 banners.
```
```
Example: Two Horse empire banners must be
removed from the region on the left at the end of
the Horse empire’s turn. The region on the right
contains a farm, so the six Bear empire banners
were permitted to remain in the region at the end of
the Bear empire’s turn.
```

### Attack Action

Choose a region controlled by another
empire. Move any number of banners
from an adjacent region controlled by the
active empire into the chosen region. You
cannot attack across oceans or seas.

If any banners are being moved from
a conquered region (e.g. a region
containing the active empire’s banners
which is not one of its like-colored
home regions), you must leave at
least 1 banner behind. **You can never
completely abandon a conquered
enemy region using an attack.**

```
Example: Bear attacks with 3 banners, and
Horse defends with 2 banners and a fort. The
battle is a tie. All banners are killed and returned
to the supply. The Horse empire retains control
of the contested region as it is one of its home
regions.
```
**_Example:_** _The Bear army making the attack
must leave a banner behind to maintain
control of the Horse home region._

### Combat

```
Combat occurs when banners from one
empire move into a region controlled by
another empire. Losses are then taken
with each side discarding banners at a 1:
ratio until one (or both) side is depleted.
If either side has any banners remaining,
they have won the battle.
```
**_Example:_** _The Horse army cannot use an Attack
action to move into another region it controls._

```
Example: Horse attacks with 3 banners, and
Bear defends with 2 banners. Horse wins the
battle, and all banners killed are returned to
the supply.
```
You may never use the Attack action to
simply shift banners among an empire’s
controlled regions, it must be used to
attack into an enemy-controlled region.

```
Regions with forts add an extra
banner to the defending army for the
duration of the combat.
```

## MARK THE TURN

Place the current turn marker on the
next available space on the turn tracker.
The first player marker now passes to
the next player clockwise. If the last
turn marker is placed, the game ends
(without performing the Swap and
Cleanup Phases), and you proceed to
Final Scoring (see page 15).

## SWAP PHASE

Starting with the first player and
proceeding clockwise, you each have
the opportunity to swap any two
of your **_unrevealed_** loyalty tokens.
To swap two loyalty tokens, simply
switch the loyalty slot in which the two
loyalty tokens you chose are currently
positioned in and flip them face up so
the empire symbols are now visible.
These are now revealed and cannot be
swapped in subsequent turns.

## CLEANUP PHASE

At this point, each player must discard
any empire cards in excess of the
maximum hand size of 5.

Gameplay returns to the Deploy Agents
Phase and a new game round begins.


Throughout the game, you will be
acquiring empire cards and adding
them to your hand. These can be played
from your hand to affect the game in a
variety of different ways. Each empire’s
cards will have their own symbol
displayed at the top of the card.

### Playing Cards

```
To play a card, decide which card
you’ll be playing and choose one of the
abilities listed on it. Then, pay its cost
—you’ll do this by discarding cards of
the empire and quantities shown in the
cost listed beside the chosen ability. The
card being played counts as one of the
cards being discarded to pay the cost.
For this reason, the first ability on each
card can be played without discarding
any additional cards.
```
```
You can play a card immediately before,
during, or immediately after using
one of your own agents, and the agent
doesn’t have to match the empire of
the card(s) being played. Any time a
card is played or discarded, it should
be shuffled back into the empire deck it
belongs to.
```
### 5-Card Limit

You may add as many cards to your
hand as you like, but during the
Cleanup Phase (see page 13), you must
discard down to no more than 5 cards
in your hand.

Example: To play the above ability from an

cards: this card with its Bear/blue empire
ability, and a Lion/yellow empire card. This
is not in addition to any other cards, just two
cards total will leave your hand.
```
**_Note:_** _Card abilities often allow you to break a
rule of the game. Therefore if there is a conflict
between a general rule and a card ability,
follow the instruction on the card._


## FINAL SCORING

The game ends after the Reveal Loyalty
Phase of the 4th round. At this point all
loyalty tokens are scored (described on
page 8) and the player who scores the
most points is the winner. If two players
are tied for equal points then the player
that swapped loyalty the least during
the game wins. If both players are still
tied, the player with the most empire
cards in hand wins.

### Player Scores

Loyalty tokens will score you points
based on the loyalty level they are
bet on and the number of cities the
corresponding empire controls.

**_Note:_** _Details on scoring loyalty tokens
can be found in the “Loyalty Tokens and
Scoring” section on page 8._

The player with the highest score wins
and their secret society rules the world
from the shadows.

## ADVANCED RULES

### Assigning Agents to Regions

```
When assigning agents during the
Deploy Agents Phase, instead of
assigning an agent to a council position
you may choose to assign it to any
region on the map, even if occupied.
```
```
A player’s agent in a region counts as
a city for that player in final scoring.
Players can have a maximum of two
agents deployed to the map. Regions
can contain more than one agent, but
not from the same player.
```
```
Agents played to a region can be
retrieved at the start of the Deploy
Agents phase, just like any other agent.
Agents cannot be added or removed
from the map in any other way.
```
```
Example: The Pale Raven has deployed an
agent to this brown region. At the end of the
game, whatever empire controls this region
scores this player points based on their loyalty
to it. For instance, if the Bear empire controls
this region at game’s end and The Pale Raven
has a Devout loyalty to the Bear empire, then
The Pale Raven player will score 4 points for
this agent.
```

## COMMON TERMS
**Add:** To take a banner from the supply
and add it to a region on the map.

**Army:** All allied banners in one region.

**Banner:** A single empire unit, represented
by a colored cube.

**Home region:** A region on the map that,
when empty of banners, is controlled by
its like-colored home empire.

**Kill:** Remove a banner from the map and
return it to its home banner reserve pile.
