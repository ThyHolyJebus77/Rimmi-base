   - Work together to find the safe, crack it, and complete the finale without getting caught.

3. On Your Turn:
   - You have 4 actions. Choose from:
     a) Move to an adjacent tile (flip it face-up if it's face-down)
     b) Peek at an adjacent tile without moving there
     c) Use the special ability of the tile you're on
     d) Prep a gear card (place it in front of you to use later)

4. After Your Turn:
   - Move the bouncer on your floor 3 spaces towards its destination.
   - If the bouncer reaches its destination, draw a new patrol card for a new destination.

5. Important Rules:
   - If you're on the same tile as a bouncer, you gain 2 heat.
   - If anyone reaches 6 heat, everyone loses!
   - Some tiles and chips have special effects when you enter or reveal them.

6. Cracking the Safe:
   - Find the Owner's Office to get safe dice.
   - Move dice to the Safe tile.
   - Roll dice to match numbers on tiles in the same row/column as the Safe.

7. Winning:
   - After cracking the safe, complete the finale card's instructions to win!

Remember, you can use your character's special abilities and prepped gear at any time to help you succeed. Work together and communicate to pull off the perfect heist!

[[Burgle Bros 2.pdf]]

Introduction
The Burgle Bros are back at it. Never one to turn down a challenging heist, they have decided to take down a string of casinos. But this is no ofice job—tougher safes, tightened security, and, perhaps worst of all, you’ll be working during the day!

Playmat Setup
To build the table, open the box, insert the legs in the corners, and flip it over. Make sure to tilt the legs outward. Then place one playmat on the table and one underneath.
















2
Before Your Heist (Campaign Mode) Because one job is never enough.
Burgle Bros 2: Casino Capers is designed to be played as a series of nine heists, each with a unique finale and reward!
You do not need the same players or even the same number of players as you move from heist to heist.
You will find two envelopes in the box.
•	The large envelope contains nine finale cards. During each heist of the campaign, you will use
the top card from this envelope. Each finale is numbered—start at 1 and work your way to 9 as you play through the campaign.
•	The small envelope is full of rewards that you will gain at the end of each heist.
You will also find the Heist Log, which tracks your progress through the campaign. An important part of this is the Suspicion Meter, which
will prompt you to add distracted cards to the patrol decks or remove patrol cards from them, depending on your current Suspicion.
For your first heist, you start at 6 Suspicion.

Playing with a Random Finale
If you’ve played through all nine heists—or you just want to skip the campaign—you can play Random Finale Mode instead.
In this mode, ignore the rulebook sections marked “Campaign Mode.” Otherwise, this mode follows all of the normal rules of play.
When setting up, you’ll place all 9 finale cards nearby. Feel free to take out any finales you’ve already won and have Finale Loot for (page 13).
When you crack the Safe, you’ll shufle the finale cards and draw one of them at random. Use that finale to finish your heist.
If you want to adjust the dificulty of Random Finale Mode, you may set the Suspicion Meter to any level you wish and set up your game accordingly. The normal dificulty is 6 Suspicion.
3
Heist Setup
1.   Find the Owner’s Ofice and Safe tiles,as well as both Monorail and Escalator tiles (6 tiles total) and set them aside. Take the remaining 26 tiles and shufle them facedown.
2.   Take the Owner’s Ofice, one Monorail, and one Escalator tile and add 13 random facedown tiles. Shufle those 16 tiles face-down and then arrange them in a 4×4 grid on the first floor. Repeat this step for the second floor with the Safe, one Monorail, and one Escalator tile, adding the remaining 13 random tiles.
3.   Place 8 walls on the first floor and 8 walls on the second floor. You can place each wall between any two tiles, but you cannot close off a tile completely.(Spreading walls out works best.)
4.   Shufle the 17 chips into a facedown pile. Remove 1 random chip and return it to the box facedown. In a two-player game, remove a Saleswoman chip instead of a random one.
5.   In Campaign Mode, add distracted cards or remove patrol cards from the patrol decks as prompted by the Suspicion Meter. Then, regardless of play mode, shufle the patrol decks for the first and second floors separately, and place them facedown nearby.
6.   Draw 1 patrol card from the first-floor patrol deck. On that floor, place 8 chips facedown as it indicates with dots. Also place a bouncer figure on the tile marked with a letter and number.
Then place that card face up next to its patrol deck in a discard pile.
7.   Repeat step 6 for the second floor, using a second-floor patrol card. Keep the discard piles for the two patrol decks separate.
8.   Draw 1 more patrol card from each deck, and place a destination marker on each floor on the tile indicated with a letter and num-ber. (This is the destination of the bouncer.) Discard that card.
9.   Each player chooses a member of the Burgle Bros and takes their figure, character card, and gear cards.They place their gear cards face up under their character card, so only the gear titles are visible.
10. Shufle the Pool event deck and the Lounge event deck sepa-rately and place them facedown nearby.
11. Keep all dice, heat cubes, counting cubes, and tokens nearby.
12. In Campaign Mode, take the finale card for this heist out of its envelope, but do not flip it over to read its rules! If you’re playing
4	Random Finale Mode instead, place all the finale cards nearby.

How to Play, Win...and Lose Time to plan the job.
Burgle Bros 2: Casino Capers is a cooperative game where you and your friends will try to infiltrate a casino in broad daylight, crack the safe, and get out, all without getting caught by the casino’s bouncers.
This game is played over a series of turns. Every time a player takes a turn, the bouncer on the same floor of the casino takes one too.
Once that player and the bouncer are done, the next player in clock-wise order starts their turn—and so on. Keep playing like this until you win or lose as a team!
You win if you crack the safe and complete the finale (pages 12–13).
You lose if any player reaches 6 heat, which you generally get from the bouncers and some of the nastier rooms of the casino.
To learn how to play, just keep reading—you’ll first need to get inside by Entering the Casino (below), then play out your turn as described in Player’s Turn (page 7), and then get the bouncer going as de-scribed in Bouncer’s Turn (page 8).

Entering the Casino First, we need to break in.
Before the first player takes their turn, the players must choose 2 corner tiles of the casino on the first floor as their entrances. Place an entrance token on those tiles.
After this, figure out which player will take their first turn.The first player is whoever gambled last—or choose randomly!
When each player starts their first turn, they must move into one of the 2 entrance tiles. Then, they’ll reveal the tile (flip it face up per-manently) if it is not revealed.
This tile might make you do something.
If it says When You enter, do what it says.
This very first move doesn’t cost an action. They will then have 4 actions to take on their turn—which you will learn about...now.

6
Player’s Turn Let’s get down to business.
On your turn, you can take up to 4 actions. You can take fewer than 4 actions, you can take the same action multiple times, and you can take them in any order. Here are the actions you can take:

•	Move to an adjacent tile (not through a wall). If there is a facedown chip, reveal it first and resolve it. Then, re-
veal the tile if you’re still on it.(Reveal means to flip something face up permanently.) Finally, if the tile has a When You enter effect, resolve it.

•	Peek at an adjacent tile (not through a wall). Re-veal the chip there, then reveal the tile.

•	Use the While here action on your cur-rent tile, if it has one.

•	Prep a gear card.Once per turn,
you may take a gear card from behind your character card and place it face
up in front of you. It’s now prepped to use.

If you enter a tile with a bouncer or if one enters your tile, you gain 2 heat.(Mark this by taking heat cubes. If anyone has 6 heat or more, you all lose!)

If you enter or reveal a tile with a chip,all kinds of wacky things can happen. To learn what it does, read page 14!


Moving, Jumping, and Adjacency
When a figure moves, place that figure onto an adjacent tile. A tile is adjacent to each tile touching its edge, but not diagonally! Also, if there is a wall between 2 tiles, those tiles are not adjacent.
Some things in this game will tell you (or a bouncer) to jump to a specific tile. Just pick up the figure and put it on that tile, ignoring any walls and tiles in between! However, you still resolve any chips there, reveal the tile if it’s facedown, and resolve any When You enter
effects, unless you’re told otherwise.	7
Bouncer’s Turn Just another day on the job.
After a player ends their turn, the bouncer on the same floor moves 3 spaces toward his current destination.(To be clear—this is once per player, not once after the players all take a turn.)
The bouncer moves toward his destination on the shortest path. If multiple paths are equally short, the bouncer takes the path that moves him clockwise toward his destination.


In this example, the bouncer moves along the bottom route because it is as long as the other path but moves him clockwise.

Think of the two paths forming a circle, and the bouncer follows the most clockwise path on that circle.

Bouncers do not reveal tiles as they move, and they ignore any chips they move over. In general, bouncers ignore the text on face-up tiles they move over, but the tiles with brown banners (Surveillance and Crow’s Nest) have effects when bouncers enter.
If the bouncer reaches his destination, draw a new patrol card from this floor’s deck, and place the destination marker on the indicated tile to show the bouncer’s new destination. If the bouncer has any movement left, continue moving him toward his new destination.







In this example, the bouncer moves up 2 spaces and reaches his destina-tion. Then he draws a new destina-tion card, sets his new destination, and moves his last remaining space toward the new destination.

8
If the bouncer enters a tile with any players, each player there gains 2 heat. The bouncer does not stop there unless he’s out of movement.
After the bouncer finishes moving, his turn ends, and the next clock-wise player begins their turn.
At some Suspicion levels you will find distracted cards in the patrol deck (page 3). If you draw a distracted card, choose any tile on your floor with an even number in the bottom-left corner as the bouncer’s destination.If there are no tiles with even numbers, draw another card.

Hunting
If a bouncer ever needs a new destination but the patrol deck for his floor is empty, remove the destination marker for that bouncer off the playmat for that floor. That bouncer is now hunting.
He will now use his movement to move toward the nearest player. (If multiple players are equally close, the players choose between them.) The bouncer still moves 3 spaces per turn, unless he reaches a player.
If a hunting bouncer enters a tile with any players, each player there gains 2 heat, as normal, but the bouncer stops moving.
If a hunting bouncer starts his turn in a tile with a player, each play-er there gains 2 heat, and the bouncer does not move.
A hunting bouncer’s destination marker can be returned to the playmat by commotions, gear, or event cards. If you set a new destination in this way, place the destination marker on the prompted tile, and the bouncer will stop hunting until he reaches that destination.
Cards that make you change or swap a destination have no effect if there is no destination marker on the playmat for that floor.


In this example, the bouncer reaches his destination, but the patrol deck for his floor is empty. Because of this, he starts hunting.

The nearest player is 2 spaces below him, so he moves his remaining 2 spaces toward the player, who gains 2 heat!



9
Commotions
What’s going on? Did a scorpion get into the potato salad again?
Some things, such as tiles and chips, will make a commotion.
When something makes a commotion, set the destination marker on that floor to the tile where the commotion happened. The bouncer immediately moves 1 space toward that tile. This doesn’t count as one of  the bouncer’s
3 moves on his upcoming turn, and this may result in players gaining heat.
If the commotion is on a tile with a bouncer,ignore the commotion. The bouncer doesn’t change destination or move.
When a bouncer reaches the commotion,he sets a new destination. Draw a new patrol card. If there are no patrol cards, he starts hunting. He keeps moving if he still has movement left.
Bouncers only care about the newest commotion. Once they reach a destination, they won’t remember past commotions.





















10
Gear
Locked, stocked, and smoking hot.
Each player starts with a few gear cards behind their character card.
Once per turn, you can use the Prep action to make one of your gear cards prepped—pull out the gear card from behind your character card, and place it in front of you.(You can have multiple gear cards prepped at once.)
You can use prepped gear at any time. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the holder’s turn, another player’s turn, or a bouncer’s turn. You can even use it immediately after new information is revealed that chang-es your plans, such as flipping up a patrol card to see a bouncer’s new destination. When in doubt, interpret when you can use gear in a way that is friendliest to the players.
If gear is used during a bouncer’s turn, the “current player” is the player who just took a turn.
A gear card shows how many uses it has before it is flipped over. Each time you use a gear card, add a counting cube to it. You don’t need to prep the gear in order to use it again!


This gear card, Bingo, can be used twice before it is flipped to its backside.


Bingo
Change the destination of a bouncer to a tile in the same row or column as his current destination.


FLIP AFTER 2 USES


Spend 1 action on your turn:

Take 1 heat from any other player, then discard this card.


After a gear card is flipped, its back shows a new ability that can only be used during the holder’s turn by spending an action. Once this ability is used, remove the gear card from the game.


Alternate Gear
As you play through the campaign, you will unlock alternate gear cards for spe-cific characters, which get added to the rest of their gear behind their character card during setup.



alternate for bingo Crybaby
This gear, Crybaby, is an alternate for Bingo.

In play, you can prep either a standard gear card or its alternate. If you prep the standard gear, remove its alternate from the game.
If you prep the alternate, remove its standard gear from the game.	11
Cracking the Safe
We’ve found the safe. Now, just need to crack it.
After the Safe is revealed, you can begin moving safe dice to it. (Safe dice come from Mole chips, described on page 14.)
While you are on the Owner’s Ofice, you can spend 1 action to move a safe die from the Owner’s Ofice to the Safe.


In this example, the player spends 2 actions to move 2 dice from the Owner’s Ofice to the Safe.


While you are on the Safe, you can spend 1 action to roll all the dice that are on the Safe. If a die roll matches a number on any tiles in the same row or column as the Safe, cover all of those numbers with a crack token.(Crack tokens stay forever. Cracked tiles still have numbers.)


In this example, a “2” and “4” were rolled. This cracks the “2” Crow’s Nest, as well as both
the “4” Slots and “4” Escalator.

Even after these numbers are covered, they can still be referenced by gear and other cards.


After rolling, return 1 die from the Safe to the Owner’s Ofice. If you have actions left, and if there is still at least 1 die on the Safe, you can spend 1 action to roll again.
Once you reveal all the tiles in the same row and column as the Safe and cover the numbers on those tiles, you’ve cracked the Safe. Time to complete the finale! Read on through the next page.
12
Completing the Finale Let’s finish the job and get out of Dodge.



BODYGUARD HEIST ONE
We know that two celebrities are in grave danger. In
the safe we’ll discover who they are, but then we have to ﬁnd them
and guide them out of the casino. Oh, and we’ll need
to keep them hidden from the bouncers. There better be a reward for this...

Fake Orders: Take 2 random discarded patrol cards and put them at the bottom of either patrol deck. Setup: Gather all the chips used in this game, then shuﬄe them facedown. Take a random discarded patrol card for each ﬂoor and place chips facedown as the card shows. If a chip would be placed on a tile with a player on it, choose any other tile with no player or chip.
•  In a two-player game, choose 6 chips to discard after placing them. •  In a three-player game, choose 3 chips to discard after placing them.
If a Prima Donna is discarded in the step above, put it back on the tile facedown instead. Rules
•  Chips still activate normally. Players may peek at an adjacent chip even if its tile is revealed.
•  When a player enters a tile with a Prima Donna chip, they take it and put it on their character card. Win: Once 2 Prima Donna chips are on character cards, players can exit through any tile with an entrance token. Once all the players have exited the casino, they win!
Lose: If a player with a Prima Donna chip is ever on the same tile as a bouncer, the players lose.


If you’re playing Campaign Mode, flip over your finale card.
If you’re playing Random Finale Mode, shufle the deck of finale cards, and draw one at random.
The finale card will describe any necessary setup and special rules.
Many finales will require your players to exit through a specific tile or tiles. If you end your turn on one of those tiles while meeting any other requirements to exit listed on the finale, you automatically exit. (No action or move required!)
After a player exits, the bouncer on their floor skips his turn. Bouncers only take turns after players inside the casino. After players exit they no longer take turns, but they can use their prepped gear.
If you complete the finale, your heist succeeds and you win! Some finales have extra ways to lose in addition to losing from gaining too much heat.

After Your Heist (Campaign Mode) You’re already thinking about that next caper.
When the game ends, fill out the Heist Log! Write down the names of the players, whether you won or lost, and your new Suspicion.
If your heist succeeded, add 1 Suspicion. If your heist failed,subtract 1. Suspicion cannot go lower than 1 or greater than 10.
Take your loot! If your heist succeeded, find the Finale Loot sticker sheet. Take the sticker matching the finale you just won, and stick it on the Trophy Case located under the trays in the center of the box.
New ability unlocked! Win or lose, take the top card from the small-er envelope. This is an alternate gear card that gives a character even more options in future heists (page 11).
Whether you won or lost, play the next heist in your next game.	13
Chips Glossary
chips have different effects when they are revealed.
red chips activate if you enter their tile but are discarded if you peek into their tile.
Drunk: Watch it! Do not reveal the tile under this chip. If you’re on the first floor, you slide—jump to the next tile in the same direction you were moving (even through

If you’re on the second floor, you fall—jump down to the first-floor tile in the same row and column.
After resolving the effect, discard this chip. If needed, reveal the tile and chip of the room you jumped into.
Saleswoman: Stop...talking.While on this tile, you can-not use the move action. When another player enters this tile, or if you are moved by an event or gear, discard this chip—you’re no longer stuck!

Buffet
Each time a player enters this tile, add a counting cube. When the Buffet has 3 counting cubes, remove them all and make a commotion on that tile. The bouncer immedi-ately moves 3 spaces toward it, instead of the 1 space for a normal commotion.
If the bouncer reaches the Buffet in less than 3 spaces, he stops moving (until his turn).

Cashier Cages
Each time a player enters this tile, add a counting cube unless the tile already has 5 counting cubes.
When you try to move out of this tile, roll a die. If you roll lower than the number of cubes on the tile, you stay on the tile, still spending the action. Otherwise, move out.
Gear and chips can move you out without needing to roll.

Count Room
You cannot use the Peek action while on this tile.
If you end your turn on this tile, make a commotion on this tile.


Crow’s Nest
When the bouncer enters, each player on an adjacent tile, even through a wall, gains 1 heat.
Do not gain heat if you enter a tile adjacent to a Crow’s Nest that has a bouncer on it already.


Lounge and Pool
Draw an event card from the corresponding deck; you must perform the actions on the card if possible.
The event effects happen before you can take another action (or end your turn), but any player can use prepped gear before the event effects happen.
If the corresponding deck is empty, shufle the discarded cards and then draw a card.

Owner’s Ofice
When this tile is revealed, immediately place any safe dice on other tiles onto this tile instead.
While you’re on this tile, you can spend 1 action to move a safe die from here to the Safe. You can move multiple dice to the Safe during a single turn, but you’ll need to spend
an action for each die.	15

Revolving Door
While on this tile, you can spend 2 actions to jump to a diagonal tile touching the corner of this tile, ignoring walls.

You can still move out of this tile normally with the move action.


Slots
When you enter this tile, you make a commotion here unless another player on the same floor is on a tile in the same row or column as this tile.


Surveillance
When the bouncer enters this tile for any reason, a count-ing cube is added to the tile.
As soon as 4 cubes are placed on this tile,all players on the same floor as this tile gain 2 heat. Then remove the cubes.
While on this tile, a player can remove all counting cubes on the tile by spending 1 action.

Table Games
When you enter this tile, roll 2 casino dice. If the sum of the 2 numbers you rolled is either 7 or 11, you lose 1 heat.
If you roll any other sum besides a 7 or 11, make a com-motion on this tile.


Variant: Dead Drops
If you’re looking for a challenge, you can play with Dead Drops. These drops represent gear that has been stashed in the casino for you to pick up.
During setup, players do not get gear cards. Instead, shufle all gear cards into a facedown pile. Give each player a random Dead Drops card. Each card has 3 tasks you are watching for. If any player completes one of the tasks on your card,you can immediately draw 2 gear cards and choose 1 to keep. Prep that gear immediately without spending an action. Return the other card to the box. Each task can only be completed once.


Burgle Bros 2 - Setup and Rules clarification
Setting up the game:
• Setup step #4 =
In a two player game, instead of removing 1 random chip from the collection of 17, remove 1 Saleswoman 
chip instead. You then end up with 16 chips, there are 8 for Floor 1 and there are 8 for Floor 2.
• Setup step #5 = 
For a non-campaign game you start at suspicion level 6, which means 1 distracted card in the floor 1 deck 
(see back of heist log sheet). The rules actually suggest adjusting your difficulty by decreasing suspicion (= 
adding more distracted cards).
• On setup you can ignore any Distracted cards and just shuffle them back in the deck after the setup of Chips 
and Bouncer is completed.
Playing the game:
• First action to enter the Casino is FREE (costs no Action Points).

players choose which player he goes to. When using Commotions, gear or event cards, the players can lure a
