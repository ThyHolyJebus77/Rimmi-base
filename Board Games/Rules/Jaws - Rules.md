## Comparisons to Civilization 5/6
- Unlike Civ games, Jaws is asymmetrical with one player as the shark and others as humans
- Jaws focuses on a single island and ocean area, not expanding empires
- The game is much shorter, typically lasting about an hour
- There's no technological progression or city-building

## Key Information
- **Players:** 2-4
- Players play competitively (shark vs. humans)
- **Play Time:** 60+ Minutes
- **Year:** 2019

### Key Mechanics
- Hidden movement (for the shark in Act 1)
- Dice rolling for actions and attacks
- Resource management (shark tokens, gear, etc.)

### Key Features
- Two-act structure mirroring the film
- Asymmetrical gameplay (shark vs. humans)
- Thematic components (shark meeple, boat tiles)
- Event cards that recreate iconic movie moments

# Jaws - Rules

## ACT 1: AMITY ISLAND

Shark goal: Eat as many swimmers as possible while avoiding
detection by the crew.

Crew goal: Locate the shark and attach 2 barrels to it, while
protecting swimmers from being eaten.

## SETUP

Place the game board with the Amity Island: Act 1 side
faceup. Shuffle the Amity event cards and place the deck
facedown near the board.

Place the 16 swimmer tokens in a supply near the board.

Decide who will be the shark. The other players will be the
crew, and choose their crew member roles (Quint, Chief
Brody, and Hooper). All roles will carry over into Act 2.

In a 4 player game, each crew player controls a different
crew member. In a 3 player game, the 2 crew players each
control 1 crew member and collectively control the third crew
member. In a 2 player game, the crew player controls all 3
crew members.

Players take their corresponding character boards Act 1 side
up, and complete the setup for each character:

Quint: Place 2 barrel tokens next to your character board
to indicate they are on the Orca. Place the remaining barrel
tokens on the shop (center space). Place the green Quint
meeple in the maroon Orca meeple at the dock on the
eastern side of the island (space 8).

Brody: Take the beach closed token and the binoculars
token. Place the black Brody meeple at the Amity P.D.
(space 6).

Hooper: Take the fish finder token. Place the blue Hooper
meeple in the white Hooper’s boat meeple at the dock on the
western side of the island (space 5).

Shark: Attach a clip to your character board and slide it over
the 0 slot at the bottom of the swimmer track. Take the 4
power tokens and the shark meeple (do not place the shark
meeple on the board). Keep the power tokens secret from
the crew. Take the shark tracker pad and a pencil. Choose
a starting location from among the 12 spaces that contain
water. Pick a space and write the corresponding number
or letter in the location column next to start. Do not tell the
crew your starting location. All of the shark’s movement is
recorded on the shark tracker pad and kept secret from the
crew.

## ROUND SEQUENCE

Act 1 is played in rounds, each of which consists of 3 phases,
played in this order:

## 1: EVENT PHASE

Draw the top card of the Amity event deck and place
swimmers from the supply into the water of the beach spaces
according to the letters shown next to the swimmer icon.

```
Michael (Brody’s son) is a special swimmer token.
When placing swimmers, do not place Michael; only
place him if an event card specifically says to do so.
Next, read the event text aloud and follow the instructions.
```
## 2. SHARK PHASE

```
The shark may take up to 3 actions and may choose to play
1 power token. Actions can be taken multiple times in any
order. Do not show or tell your actions to the crew.
```
#### ACTIONS

```
MOVE Move through water to an adjacent space. Diagonal
spaces are not adjacent, and you cannot move across land.
```
```
EAT 1 SWIMMER Eat 1 swimmer in your space.
```
```
After you’ve planned your entire turn, record it on your shark
tracker pad. Then announce that your turn is over and give
the crew this information:
```
```
SWIMMERS EATEN Tell the crew how many swimmers
you ate and at what beach. Remove the corresponding
swimmers from the board and return them to the supply, then
slide the clip up the swimmer track on your character board 1
slot for each swimmer you ate. If your swimmer track reaches
the 9 slot, Act 1 immediately ends.
```
```
MOTION SENSORS At any point during your turn,
if you are in a space with a floating barrel, you trigger
its motion sensor.
At the end of your turn, you must inform the crew of any
barrels whose motion sensors you triggered. You do not have
to say when you triggered them—whether it was before or
after eating swimmers—or in what order you triggered them if
you triggered multiple motion sensors.
```
```
POWER TOKEN Each power token gives you a special
ability in the round it is played. Each may be used only once
per game. If you play a power token, inform the crew and
place the token facedown in front of you. Do not tell the crew
which token you are playing.
```
#### POWER TOKENS

```
FEEDING FRENZY You may eat all swimmers in your
space as 1 action.
```
```
EVASIVE MOVES You do not trigger any motion sensors
this round, even if you move through spaces with floating
barrels.
```
```
OUT OF SIGHT If Brody uses his binoculars or if Hooper
uses his fish finder this round, tell them you are not there or
nearby, even if this is not true. The token is returned to the
box at the end of the round, even if the crew took neither
search action. If Quint launches a barrel into your space, you
must still announce that you’ve been hit.
```
```
SPEED BURST You may move up to 3 spaces as 1 action.
This may be done only once. Any other move actions you take
are 1 space, as normal.
```
## 3. CREW PHASE

```
Each crew member may take up to 4 actions. The crew may
take their turns in any order, but once a crew member starts
their turn, they must finish it before the next takes their turn.
Each crew member has different actions. They can be taken
multiple times (unless stated otherwise) and in any order.
```
#### QUINT

```
MOVE Move through water to an adjacent space. Diagonal
spaces are not adjacent, and you cannot move across land.
```
```
RESCUE 1 SWIMMER Remove 1 swimmer from your
space and return it to the supply.
```
```
PICK UP BARRELS Pick up any number of barrels in
your space from either a dock, the water, or Hooper’s boat.
Each source is a separate action.
```
```
LAUNCH A BARREL (once per round) Quint launches
barrels into the water using a harpoon gun on the Orca.
You may launch a barrel into your own space or an adjacent
space. Diagonal spaces are not adjacent. You cannot launch
a barrel over land.
```
```
Place the barrel token in the space you are targeting. The
shark must announce if they are in that space. If the shark is
there, it is hit and the barrel is attached to it: place the barrel
on the shark’s character board.
```
```
If this is the second barrel attached to the shark, Act 1
immediately ends.
```
```
If the shark is not in that space, the barrel remains in the
water. It is now a floating barrel with a motion sensor the
shark might trigger in future rounds.
```
#### BRODY

```
MOVE Move across land to an adjacent space. Diagonal
spaces are not adjacent, and you cannot move through water.
```
```
RESCUE 1 SWIMMER Remove 1 swimmer from your
space and return it to the supply.
```
```
PICK UP 1 BARREL If you are at the shop, pick up 1
barrel. Place the barrel under your meeple to indicate you are
carrying it. You may carry only 1 barrel at a time.
```
```
DROP 1 BARREL If you are at a dock and carrying a
barrel, drop it by placing the barrel on the dock’s barrel
symbol. There is no limit to the number of barrels that can
be at a dock.
```
```
USE BINOCULARS (once per round) If you
are at one of the 4 beach spaces, place the
binoculars token on your space. The shark must
announce if they are in the water at that beach.
```
```
If they are, place the shark meeple there.
```
```
If the shark played the out of sight power token this round,
they will tell you that they are not there in any case.
```
```
CLOSE A BEACH (once per round) If you are
at the Mayor’s Office or the Amity P.D., close
any beach, as long as it has no swimmers. Place
the beach closed token faceup on the beach.
```
```
When an event card would have you place one or more
swimmers at that beach, do not place them, but instead flip
over the token so it shows opening soon.
```
```
The next time an event card would have you place one or
more swimmers at that beach, do not place them, but instead
remove the beach closed token from the board.
```
```
Only 1 beach can be closed at any given time. If a beach is
closed, you may take this action to close a different beach.
Move the beach closed token to the newly closed beach and
turn it faceup.
```
#### HOOPER

```
MOVE Move up to 2 spaces as 1 action. Each move must be
through water to an adjacent space. Diagonal spaces are not
adjacent, and you cannot move across land.
```
```
RESCUE 1 SWIMMER Remove 1 swimmer from your
space and return it to the supply.
```
```
PICK UP BARRELS Pick up any number of barrels in
your space from either a dock or the water. Each source is a
separate action.
GIVE BARRELS TO QUINT If you are in the same
space as Quint, give him all the barrels you have on your boat.
Place the barrels next to Quint’s character board to indicate
they are now on the Orca. Hooper cannot launch barrels into
the water.
```
```
USE FISH FINDER (once per round) Place
the fish finder token in the water in your space.
The shark must announce where they are in
relation to the fish finder.
```
- If the shark is in the same space, they must tell you. Place
    the shark meeple there.
- If the shark is in an adjacent space that is connected
    by water, they must tell you they are “nearby.” Diagonal
    spaces are not adjacent.
- If the shark is neither in the same space nor an adjacent
    space, they must tell you they are “not there or nearby.”

```
If the shark played the out of sight power token this round,
they will tell you that they are not there or nearby in any case.
```
## END OF THE ROUND

```
After all 3 crew members have taken their turn, the round
is over. If the shark played a power token that round, return
it facedown to the box. Begin a new round, starting with the
event phase.
```
## END OF ACT 1

```
Act 1 ends immediately if one of the following happens:
```
1. The crew attaches a second barrel to the shark.
2. The swimmer track on the shark’s board reaches the 9
    slot.

```
Start Act 2. Do not move the clip on the swimmer track yet.
```
## ACT 2: THE ORCA

```
Shark goal: Eliminate all 3 crew members or completely
destroy the Orca.
```
```
Crew goal: Eliminate the shark.
```
## SETUP

```
Shuffle the shark ability cards and randomly give the shark
the number of cards indicated by the swimmer track on their
character board from Act 1. The shark player may look at
their cards, but should keep them hidden from the crew.
Give each crew member their 2 corresponding gear cards and
their target token.
```
```
Shuffle the crew gear cards and randomly give the crew (as a
group) the number of cards indicated by the shark’s swimmer
track.
```

The crew divides these cards among the 3 crew members
however they choose. Each crew member places all of their
gear cards faceup next to their character board.

Flip all 4 character boards to the Act 2 side. Attach a clip to
each character board and slide it over the 0 slot at the top of
the wound track.

Flip the board to the Orca: Act 2 side.

Build the Orca by placing 1 boat tile in each of the 8 zones
on the board. Each tile should show the undamaged side.

Shuffle the resurface cards and place them facedown in a
deck on the Deck spot on the board.

Each crew member places their meeple on a boat space of
their choice. Any number of crew members can share a space.

Give the shark player the 3 large resurface tokens and the
shark meeple. Place the 3 small resurface tokens and the 3
dice next to the board.

## ROUND SEQUENCE

Act 2 is played in rounds, each of which consists of 6 steps,
played in this order:

## 1: RESURFACE OPTIONS

Turn over the top 3 resurface cards and place 1 faceup on
each spot (A, B, or C) on the board. The cards should be
rotated so the boat outline matches the orientation of the
Orca on the board.

These are the shark’s 3 resurface options for this round. The
resurface zone (highlighted in red) is the zone where the
shark will resurface if they choose that card.

Place the small resurface tokens (A, B, and C) in the water
spaces of the corresponding zones so players can more
easily see all of the resurface options for the round.

If the resurface cards run out, shuffle the discard pile to
create a new deck.

## 2. SHARK CHOOSES

The shark secretly selects one of the 3 resurface cards by
playing a large resurface token (A, B, or C) facedown in front
of them.

The shark may also play 1 shark ability card from their hand
by placing the card facedown underneath their resurface
token. Each ability is active during the round in which the
card is played. The card is removed from the game at the end
of the round, whether the ability was used or not.

## 3. CREW PREPARES

The crew prepares for the shark’s appearance by moving
(optional), choosing weapons, and placing target tokens.
The crew may discuss their options and intentions, but they
should not discuss them until after the shark has locked in
their resurface token in step 2.

MOVE
Each crew member may move up to 2 adjacent spaces.
You may move through boat and/or water spaces. However,
moving from a water space onto an adjacent boat space
requires climbing back onto the boat and takes both of
your moves.

###### CHOOSE WEAPON

```
Each crew member chooses 1 weapon from their crew gear
cards.
```
```
There are 3 types, designated by the symbol in the card’s
top-left corner.
```
```
MELEE WEAPONS: These are close-range weapons
```
(^) that allow you to roll dice to inflict wounds on the shark.
FIREARM WEAPONS: These also allow you to roll dice
to inflict wounds on the shark, but they may be used at
any range.
ATTACHABLE WEAPON: These are close-range
weapons that are attached to the shark and hinder it.
The effect remains active for as long as the weapon is
attached to the shark.
Each crew member places their chosen weapon card above
their character board.
PLACE TARGET TOKEN
Each crew member places their target token in the
water space of the zone where they think the shark
will resurface. Multiple crew members may target
the same space.
If you are using a melee weapon or an attachable
weapon, you must be in the same space or adjacent
to the water space you are targeting.
If you are using a firearm weapon, you may target
any water space, regardless of where you are.
ACCESSORIES
Crew gear cards that do not have a symbol in the top-left
corner are accessories that can be used in addition to
weapons. The 3 types are:
CHUM: After the shark locks in their resurface token in
step 2, Chum may be played. The shark must reveal 1 of
the 2 resurface tokens that they did not choose. This gives
the crew a better chance of predicting where the shark will
resurface. Only 1 Chum card may be played each round.
AMMO: The Pistol and Rifle are each loaded with 1 shot.
Extra ammo lets you discard the ammo instead of the weapon
after firing, saving the weapon for use in a later round.
SHARK CAGE: The Shark Cage may be played before the
shark rolls for an attack. The crew member who uses it
cannot take any wounds in the round in which it is played.

## STEP 4: SHARK REVEALS

```
The shark flips over their chosen resurface token. Discard
the 2 resurface cards that were not chosen.
```
```
Place the shark meeple in the chosen zone’s water space
and return all target tokens that are not in that space.
```
```
If the shark played a shark ability card, it is also revealed at
this time and its ability goes into effect.
```
```
SHAKE OFF If the chosen resurface card has a
shake off symbol, the shark shakes off (discards) all
attachable weapons attached to them.
```
```
At the start of Act 2, each zone has 2 spaces: a boat space
and a water space. After a boat tile is destroyed (removed
from the game), that zone will only have 1 large water space.
Borders of all spaces are defined by white lines and tile edges.
```
```
Two spaces are adjacent if they share a border (white line or
tile edge). Diagonal spaces are not adjacent. As the boat gets
damaged, different spaces will gain or lose adjacency.
```
## STEP 5: CREW ATTACKS

```
Each crew member who targeted the correct zone may
attack the shark. Crew members may attack in any order.
Crew members who targeted the wrong zone do not attack.
When you attack the shark, do the following, depending on
what type of weapon you used:
```
#### MELEE WEAPON OR FIREARM WEAPON

```
Roll the number of dice shown on the card and add up the
number of hits rolled.
```
#### If the weapon has + , add 1 hit to the total.

```
If the total number of hits is equal to or less than the
shark’s evade value (shown on the resurface card),
the attack misses and the shark takes no wounds.
```
```
If the total number of hits is higher than the shark’s evade
value, the attack is successful. Subtract the evade value
from the total number of hits, and the shark takes that many
wounds. The shark slides the clip on their wound track 1 slot
for each wound taken.
Check the weapon for abilities that affect how they are used.
```
#### ATTACHABLE WEAPON

```
Automatically attach the weapon to the shark (place the
card faceup in front of the shark). You do not need to roll the
dice, and the shark’s evade value has no effect.
The weapon’s ability immediately goes into effect and stays
in effect until the shark is able to shake it off.
```
## STEP 6: SHARK ATTACKS

```
The shark may choose to attack either the boat or a crew
member in the water.
```
```
ATTACK THE BOAT
You may choose 1 boat space to attack. You must be
adjacent to the boat space you are targeting.
```
```
Announce which boat space you are attacking. Roll the
number of dice shown on the resurface card, and total the
number of hits. Apply the results, based on the hits needed
to damage or destroy the boat space.
```
```
The undamaged side of each boat tile shows 2 numbers:
the smaller number is the number of hits the shark must
roll to damage the boat space, and the larger number is the
number of hits required to destroy it.
```
```
The damaged side of each boat tile shows one number: this
number is the number of hits required to destroy the boat
space.
```
```
If you did not roll enough hits to damage the boat space, the
attack misses. If you did roll enough hits, flip the boat tile to
the damaged side.
```
```
If you rolled enough hits to destroy the boat space, remove
the boat tile from the game board.
If a boat space gets damaged or destroyed, all crew
members that were on that boat space fall into the water.
After flipping or removing the boat tile, place their meeple(s)
in the water space of that zone.
```
###### ATTACK A CREW MEMBER

```
You may choose 1 crew member to attack.
```
```
The crew member must be in the water, and they must be in
your space or an adjacent water space.
```
```
You may not attack a crew member who is on the boat.
```
```
Announce which crew member you are attacking, then roll
the number of dice shown on the resurface card. The crew
member takes 1 wound for each hit rolled. The crew member
slides the clip on their wound track 1 slot for each wound
taken.
```
#### BONUS ATTACK(S)

```
Before going underwater again, the shark may roll a bonus
attack against each crew member that is in the water near
them.
```
```
One at a time, roll 1 die against each crew member that is in
your space or an adjacent water space. The targeted crew
members take 1 wound for each hit rolled.
```
#### ELIMINATING CREW MEMBERS

```
If a crew member’s wound tracker reaches , they have
been eliminated from the game. Remove their crew meeple
from the board and discard all of their gear cards.
```
## END OF THE ROUND

```
After the shark finishes their attack and any bonus attacks,
the round is over and the shark dives back into the depths.
Remove the shark meeple from the board, return all target
tokens to their respective crew members, and discard the
faceup resurface card and the shark ability card (if one was
used).
```
```
Begin a new round, starting with step 1.
```
## END OF THE GAME

```
The game can end in one of 3 ways:
```
1. If all 3 crew members have been eliminated, the shark
    wins.
2. If the Orca has been destroyed (all boat tiles have been
    removed), the shark wins.
3. If the shark’s wound tracker reaches , the shark
    is eliminated and the crew wins.

## PLAYING ACT 1 OR ACT 2 SEPARATELY

```
Either Act 1 or Act 2 may be played as a standalone game
with these modifications:
```
#### ACT 1

```
If the shark’s swimmer track reaches the 7 slot (or higher),
the game ends immediately and the shark wins.
If the crew attaches a second barrel to the shark before the
swimmer track reaches 7, the game ends immediately and
the crew wins.
```
#### ACT 2

```
During setup, give the shark 6 random shark ability cards.
Give each crew member their corresponding gear cards,
then give the crew (as a group) 7 random crew gear cards,
which they immediately divide among the 3 crew members
however they choose.
```

## ACT 1: AMITY ISLAND

## 1: EVENT PHASE

Draw an Amity event card and place swimmers into the
water of the beach spaces according to the letters shown
next to the swimmer icon. Resolve the event text.

## 2. SHARK PHASE

The shark may take up to 3 actions and may choose to
play 1 power token. Do not tell the crew your actions.

#### PLAN ACTIONS

MOVE Move through water to an adjacent space.

EAT 1 SWIMMER Eat 1 swimmer in your space.

Record your turn on your shark tracker pad. Announce
that your turn is over and give the crew this information:

SWIMMERS EATEN Tell the crew how many swimmers
you ate and at what beach. Remove them from the board,
then record the number eaten on your character board. If
your swimmer track reaches 9, Act 1 immediately ends.

```
MOTION SENSORS Inform the crew of any
motion sensors you triggered by being in the same
space (don’t say when or in what order).
```
POWER TOKEN Each power token may be used only
once per game. If you play a token, tell the crew and
place it facedown in front of you (don’t say which one).

#### POWER TOKENS

FEEDING FRENZY You may eat all swimmers in your
space as 1 action.

EVASIVE MOVES You do not trigger any motion
sensors this round, even if you move those spaces.

OUT OF SIGHT If Brody uses his binoculars or if
Hooper uses his fish finder this round, tell them you are
not there or nearby, even if this is not true.

SPEED BURST Once only, you may move up to 3
spaces as 1 action.

## 3. CREW PHASE

Each crew member may take up to 4 actions.

#### QUINT

MOVE Move through water to an adjacent space.

RESCUE 1 SWIMMER Remove 1 swimmer from your
space and return it to the supply.

PICK UP BARRELS Pick up any number of barrels
in your space from either a dock, the water, or Hooper’s
boat. Each source is a separate action.

LAUNCH A BARREL (once per round) into your own
space or an adjacent space. Place the barrel token; the
shark must announce if they are in that space. If so, it
is hit and the barrel is attached to it: place the barrel on
the shark’s character board. If this is the second barrel
attached to the shark, Act 1 immediately ends.

#### BRODY

```
MOVE Move across land to an adjacent space.
```
```
RESCUE 1 SWIMMER Remove 1 swimmer from your
space and return it to the supply.
```
```
PICK UP 1 BARREL At the shop, pick up 1 barrel
and place it under your meeple. You may carry only 1 at
a time.
```
```
DROP 1 BARREL If you are at a dock and carrying
a barrel, placing the barrel on the dock’s barrel symbol.
There can be any number of barrels at a dock.
```
```
USE BINOCULARS (once per round) At
one of the 4 beaches, place the binoculars
on your space. The shark must announce if
they are in the water at that beach. If they
are, place the shark meeple there.
```
```
CLOSE A BEACH (once per round) At
the Mayor’s Office or the Amity P.D., place
the beach closed token faceup on the beach
if it has no swimmers.
```
```
When an event card would have you place swimmers
there, instead flip the token to opening soon. The next
time an event card would have you place swimmers there,
instead remove the beach closed token from the board.
```
```
Only 1 beach can be closed at a time.
```
#### HOOPER

```
MOVE Move up to 2 spaces through water as 1 action.
```
```
RESCUE 1 SWIMMER Remove 1 swimmer from your
space and return it to the supply.
```
```
PICK UP BARRELS Pick up any number of barrels
in your space from a dock or the water. Each source is a
separate action.
```
```
GIVE BARRELS TO QUINT In the same space as
Quint, give him all the barrels you have on your boat.
```
```
USE FISH FINDER (once per round)
Place the fish finder token in the water in
your space. The shark must announce where
they are in relation to the fish finder.
```
```
If the shark is in the same space, they must tell you. Place
the shark meeple there.
If the shark is in an adjacent space that is connected by
water, they must tell you they are “nearby.”
If the shark is neither in the same space nor an adjacent
space, they must tell you they are “not there or nearby.”
```
## END OF THE ROUND

```
After all 3 crew members have taken their turn, the round
is over. If the shark played a power token that round,
return it facedown to the box. Begin a new round.
```
## END OF ACT 1

```
Act 1 ends immediately if one of the following happens:
```
1. The crew attaches a second barrel to the shark.
2. The swimmer track on the shark’s board reaches the 9
    slot.

```
Start Act 2. Do not move the clip on the swimmer track yet.
```
## ACT 1: AMITY ISLAND

## 1: EVENT PHASE

```
Draw an Amity event card and place swimmers into the
water of the beach spaces according to the letters shown
next to the swimmer icon. Resolve the event text.
```
## 2. SHARK PHASE

```
The shark may take up to 3 actions and may choose to
play 1 power token. Do not tell the crew your actions.
```
#### PLAN ACTIONS

```
MOVE Move through water to an adjacent space.
EAT 1 SWIMMER Eat 1 swimmer in your space.
Record your turn on your shark tracker pad. Announce
that your turn is over and give the crew this information:
```
```
SWIMMERS EATEN Tell the crew how many swimmers
you ate and at what beach. Remove them from the board,
then record the number eaten on your character board. If
your swimmer track reaches 9, Act 1 immediately ends.
```
```
MOTION SENSORS Inform the crew of any
motion sensors you triggered by being in the same
space (don’t say when or in what order).
```
```
POWER TOKEN Each power token may be used only
once per game. If you play a token, tell the crew and
place it facedown in front of you (don’t say which one).
```
#### POWER TOKENS

```
FEEDING FRENZY You may eat all swimmers in your
space as 1 action.
```
```
EVASIVE MOVES You do not trigger any motion
sensors this round, even if you move those spaces.
```
```
OUT OF SIGHT If Brody uses his binoculars or if
Hooper uses his fish finder this round, tell them you are
not there or nearby, even if this is not true.
```
```
SPEED BURST Once only, you may move up to 3
spaces as 1 action.
```
## 3. CREW PHASE

```
Each crew member may take up to 4 actions.
```
#### QUINT

```
MOVE Move through water to an adjacent space.
```
```
RESCUE 1 SWIMMER Remove 1 swimmer from your
space and return it to the supply.
```
```
PICK UP BARRELS Pick up any number of barrels
in your space from either a dock, the water, or Hooper’s
boat. Each source is a separate action.
```
```
LAUNCH A BARREL (once per round) into your own
space or an adjacent space. Place the barrel token; the
shark must announce if they are in that space. If so, it
is hit and the barrel is attached to it: place the barrel on
the shark’s character board. If this is the second barrel
attached to the shark, Act 1 immediately ends.
```
#### BRODY

```
MOVE Move across land to an adjacent space.
```
```
RESCUE 1 SWIMMER Remove 1 swimmer from your
space and return it to the supply.
```
```
PICK UP 1 BARREL At the shop, pick up 1 barrel
and place it under your meeple. You may carry only 1 at
a time.
```
```
DROP 1 BARREL If you are at a dock and carrying
a barrel, placing the barrel on the dock’s barrel symbol.
There can be any number of barrels at a dock.
```
```
USE BINOCULARS (once per round) At
one of the 4 beaches, place the binoculars
on your space. The shark must announce if
they are in the water at that beach. If they
are, place the shark meeple there.
```
```
CLOSE A BEACH (once per round) At
the Mayor’s Office or the Amity P.D., place
the beach closed token faceup on the beach
if it has no swimmers.
```
```
When an event card would have you place swimmers
there, instead flip the token to opening soon. The next
time an event card would have you place swimmers there,
instead remove the beach closed token from the board.
```
```
Only 1 beach can be closed at a time.
```
#### HOOPER

```
MOVE Move up to 2 spaces through water as 1 action.
```
```
RESCUE 1 SWIMMER Remove 1 swimmer from your
space and return it to the supply.
```
```
PICK UP BARRELS Pick up any number of barrels
in your space from a dock or the water. Each source is a
separate action.
```
```
GIVE BARRELS TO QUINT In the same space as
Quint, give him all the barrels you have on your boat.
```
```
USE FISH FINDER (once per round)
Place the fish finder token in the water in
your space. The shark must announce where
they are in relation to the fish finder.
```
```
If the shark is in the same space, they must tell you. Place
the shark meeple there.
If the shark is in an adjacent space that is connected by
water, they must tell you they are “nearby.”
If the shark is neither in the same space nor an adjacent
space, they must tell you they are “not there or nearby.”
```
## END OF THE ROUND

is over. If the shark played a power token that round,
return it facedown to the box. Begin a new round.
```
## END OF ACT 1

```
Act 1 ends immediately if one of the following happens:
```
1. The crew attaches a second barrel to the shark.
2. The swimmer track on the shark’s board reaches the 9
    slot.

```
Start Act 2. Do not move the clip on the swimmer track yet.
```

## ACT 2: THE ORCA

## 1: RESURFACE OPTIONS

```
Turn over the top 3 resurface cards and place 1 faceup on
each spot (A, B, or C) on the board. The resurface zone
(in red) is the zone where the shark will resurface if they
choose that card. Place the small resurface tokens (A, B,
and C) in the water spaces of the corresponding zones.
```
## 2. SHARK CHOOSES

```
The shark secretly selects one of the 3 resurface cards
by playing a large resurface token (A, B, or C) facedown
in front of them.
The shark may also play 1 shark ability card by placing
the card facedown underneath their resurface token.
Remove the card from the game at the end of the round.
```
## 3. CREW PREPARES

```
The crew may discuss their intentions, but not until after
the shark has locked in their resurface token in step 2.
```
```
MOVE Each crew member may move up to 2 adjacent
spaces through boat and/or water spaces. Moving from a
water space onto a boat space takes both moves.
```
```
CHOOSE WEAPON Each crew member chooses 1
weapon from their crew gear cards and places it above
their character board.
```
```
PLACE TARGET TOKEN Each crew
member places their target token in the water
space of the zone they think the shark will
resurface. Multiple crew may target the same space.
Melee weapon or an attachable weapon: you
must be in the same space or adjacent to the
targeted water space.
```
```
Firearm weapon: target any water space.
```
```
ACCESSORIES Crew gear cards without a symbol are
accessories that can be used in addition to weapons.
```
```
CHUM: After the shark locks in their resurface token in
step 2, Chum may be played. The shark must reveal 1 of
the 2 resurface tokens they did not choose. Only 1 Chum
card may be played each round.
AMMO: The Pistol and Rifle are each loaded with 1 shot.
Extra ammo lets you discard the ammo instead of the
weapon after firing.
```
```
SHARK CAGE: The Shark Cage may be played before the
shark rolls for an attack. The crew member who uses it
cannot take any wounds in the round in which it is played.
```
## STEP 4: SHARK REVEALS

```
The shark flips over their chosen resurface token. Discard
the 2 resurface cards not chosen. Place the shark meeple
in the chosen zone’s water space and return all target
tokens not in that space.
```
```
Any shark ability card played is also revealed at this time
and its ability goes into effect.
```
```
SHAKE OFF If the chosen resurface card has
this symbol, the shark shakes off (discards) all
attachable weapons attached to them.
```
## STEP 5: CREW ATTACKS

```
In any order, each crew member who targeted the correct
zone may attack the shark. Crew members who targeted
the wrong zone do not attack. When you attack, do the
following depending on what type of weapon you used:
```
#### MELEE WEAPON OR FIREARM WEAPON

```
Roll the number of dice shown and add up the number of
```
#### hits rolled. If the weapon has + , add 1 hit to the total.

```
If the total number of hits is equal to or less than
the shark’s evade (shown on the resurface card),
the attack misses and the shark takes no wounds.
```
```
If the total number of hits is higher than the shark’s
evade, the attack is successful. Subtract the evade value
from the total number of hits, and the shark takes that
many wounds. Check the weapon for abilities that affect
how they are used.
```
#### ATTACHABLE WEAPON Automatically attach the

```
weapon to the shark (place the card faceup in front of the
shark). You do not need to roll the dice, and the shark’s
evade has no effect. The weapon’s ability immediately
goes into effect until the shark is able to shake it off.
```
## STEP 6: SHARK ATTACKS

```
The shark may attack either the boat or a crew member
in the water.
```
```
ATTACK THE BOAT Announce 1 boat space to
attack that you are adjacent to. Roll the number of dice
shown on the resurface card, and total the hits. Apply the
results, based on the hits needed to damage or destroy
the boat space.
Undamaged boat tile: the smaller number is the number
of hits the shark must roll to damage the boat space,
and the larger number is the number of hits required to
destroy it.
Damaged boat tile: the number of hits required to destroy
the boat space.
If you did not roll enough hits to damage the boat space,
the attack misses. If you did, flip the boat tile to the
damaged side. If you rolled enough hits to destroy the
boat space, remove the boat tile from the game board.
If a boat space gets damaged or destroyed, all crew
members that were on it fall into the water; place their
meeple(s) in the water space of that zone.
```
```
ATTACK A CREW MEMBER Announce 1 crew
member in the water and in your space or an adjacent
water space to attack. Roll the number of dice shown on
the resurface card. The crew member takes 1 wound for
each hit rolled.
```
```
BONUS ATTACKS One at a time, roll 1 die for each
crew member in your space or an adjacent water space.
The crew member takes 1 wound for each hit rolled.
If a crew member’s wound tracker reaches , they are
eliminated from the game.
```
## END OF THE ROUND

```
Remove the shark meeple from the board, return target
tokens to crew members, and discard the faceup resurface
card and any shark ability card. Begin a new round.
```
