Aperture Cards

Q:  If you want to deploy an Aperture Card simply to make room in your hand or activate the Character on its flipside, can you do this even when the Card cannot have its normal effect? (For example, deploying an Excursion Funnel when all of your Test Subjects are already at the old edge of the Laboratory; deploying the Cake when you have no cake left in your supply to earn/deliver; or deploying an Incinerator when no other player has more Cake in the Laboratory than you.) Or, could you play a Card to deploy your Portal Gun but refuse to move any Portals?
A:  You can play Cards even if they wouldn't have any effect. Yes, you can fire your Portal Gun and not move the Portals. —Matt Hyra

Q:  How should I hold my Cards? I mean, which side(s) do the other players get to see?
A:  The Aperture sides are open information but the Character sides are for your eyes only (see Matt Hyra’s answer on one of the Frankenturret questions). So a good way to “hold” your cards would be to keep them flat on the table, Aperture-side-up, as demonstrated by the young lady on the back of the box. —Ed.

Cake

Q:  Can I use the Opera Turret to incinerate Cake Slices I have in front of me, or only my Cake in play in the Laboratory?
A:  In play. You will need a big lead to win this way. —Matt Hyra
Cake can be incinerated by three Character Cards (Caroline, Opera Turret, and Rick) and by the two copies of one Aperture Card (Incinerator). All of these effects apply only to Cake that is in the Laboratory. —Ed.

Q:  After my Test Subject moves a Cake Slice, does the Cake stay in my Test Subject’s possession until that subject is killed, or does it only complete the one move and get dropped again?
A:  The Cake is considered dropped once the Test Subject’s move is over, so it may be carried [again later] by any Test Subject starting their move from that Chamber. —WBRP

Character Cards

Q:  When you play a card from your hand in the first phase of your turn, and discarding it reveals a Character that has an “At the start of a player’s turn...” ability, you cannot use that ability immediately? Or is being in the first phase still considered the start of your turn?
A:  Start of turn has already happened. Essentially, you are encouraged to play cards to turn off the ability of which you just took advantage. —Matt Hyra

Q:  How long is the “start of turn” then? Does it end once you used one Character ability? I’m asking because it’s important for the interpretation of how you’re able to use Greg’s power - can you switch him to another Character and then use that Character’s start of turn power?
A:  Start of turn is an event that happens once. All “start of turn” effects trigger, then you resolve them. New “start of turn” effects added in were not present for the event, so they don’t trigger. —Matt Hyra
Keep in mind that for Greg’s power, the card specifically states that you “restart” your turn after using his power. So in this case, you will benefit from the new Character’s “at the start of your turn” ability immediately. —svardosi

Q:  Many Character Cards say “Once, at the start of each player’s turn, they may....” Am I allowed to perform the action every time it’s my turn (just once per turn, of course)?
A:  This is correct. —anomo17

Q:  What do all the Character effects do, and which Aperture effect is on the flipside of each Character? A:  See the Card Text Reference at the end of this document. —Ed.

Companion Cube token

Q:  Does the Companion Cube block you from using portals?
A:  No, it just makes the Chamber useless for reward purposes; movement is unrestricted. —AMarsReject

Hand size

Q:  Under Taking A Turn step 1., Deploying Aperture Cards, the original rulebook states “Maximum hand size is 3 cards. If you already have more than 3, you must discard down to 3.” However, in 3. Activating A Test Chamber, it states “Once a player has 3 cards they cannot earn more.” And in Additional Rules Earning A Free Test Subject or Aperture Card; “Players may have at most 3 cards in their hand.” So this seems to imply that you can’t ever get more cards to then discard down to 3 from these methods.
A:  Sorry, the limit was a late change and we must have missed this inconsistency in review. Any time you would earn a card that takes you above 3 you don’t earn the card and it stays on the draw deck. There is no discarding down to 3 and I can’t think of a case that should allow it. —Jeep Barnett
The rulebook was updated in later printings to remove the incorrect reference to discarding down to 3. —Ed.

Laboratory recycling

Q:  Does each recycled Chamber have to be placed with its right side flush against the left side of one of the three new-edge Chambers? Or can there be gaps within a row (as long as one prong fits into the row above or below).
A:  In older versions of the game [gaps were] explicitly allowed, but we removed that option to simplify things. We haven’t tested that as a possible move for quite some time. But the cool thing about board games is that you can adopt house rules. If it works for you and everyone at the table agrees, go for it! —Jeep Barnett

Q:  I don’t quite get the rule about breaking the lab. How can the lab be broken into two chunks when I am not allowed to create rows with fewer than 3 Chambers? And what does a “chunk” of lab even mean?
A:  A “chunk” (technical term) could be a single isolated Test Chamber, or any number of touching Test Chambers which, as a group, are isolated from another chunk or chunks of Test Chambers. Here is a scenario that could result in breaking into multiple “chunks.” The board starts out looking like this:



Let’s say the first four turns you always activate Test Chambers from either the top or bottom, and always recycle them to the middle. Then you’d have something like this:



Now let’s say you just activate and recycle from one end of the middle row to the other. Pretty soon you’d get to this:



Now if you continue to activate and recycle from the middle to the middle, you’ll end up with three disconnected chunks. So you can’t do that. At this point you would have to either activate from the top and recycle to the top, or activate from the bottom and recycle to the bottom. —grant5

Majorities

Q:  Is “majority” absolute (more than half of all Test Subjects on the tile) or relative (more Test Subjects on the tile than anyone else)? The example in the rulebook shows a 2-out-of-3 case, which is an obvious majority no matter how you slice it. But this distinction matters if, for example, the Chamber holds 2 Blue, 1 Red, and 1 Yellow.
A:  I would guess they mean a plurality (relative majority) rather than an absolute majority. I base this on the rules talking about what happens if there’s a tie for majority. You can’t have a tie for an absolute majority. But you can have a tie for plurality. —grant5
Yes, it looks like we should have used the word plurality. —Matt Hyra
On the other hand, “plurality” is not a common word and it very well could have seemed unclear to a lot of players. So while “majority” is not the more precise term, it is probably the more familiar one. —Ed.

Movement

Q:  Can you move backwards? Meaning, can a Test Subject move away from the old edge and toward the new edge?
A:  Yes. —bleached_lizard
Note step 2b in the diagram on page 14, where two blue Test Subjects move down one level and toward the new edge. Also note the diagram on page 17 showing that portals allow travel in either direction. —Ed.

Portal tokens and the Portal Gun

Q:  When deploying your Portal Gun, if one portal is in an “old” room already do you have to move it if you are moving the other portal?
A:  You must move it. You may place it back where it was as long as that wasn’t on an old edge. —Matt Hyra
Portal Gun use is all or nothing. If you move one token you must “move” both, but a valid token move can be placing it right back where it came from if that’s a legal Chamber for it. Also, the portals must end up in two different chambers when deploying the Portal Gun. (In contrast, note that the Chell Character Card moves only one token but she can overcome these restrictions.) —Ed.

Q:  You couldn’t move into a Chamber with a Portal and use the Portal on the same move, correct?
A:  Yes, you just treat the two tiles with Portals on them as if they were adjacent (Rulebook, page 17). It follows all the same rules as normal movement. Instead of crossing a boundary between two tiles, you’re jumping to another tile. But all the timing and other rules regarding movement apply. —grant5

Q:  Can anyone use portals? Like, on my turn, I place two portals and go through them. On my son’s turn, can he move through those portals too if he’s got a guy on the same space as one of the portals?
A:  Yes. —chengr05

Rewards

Q:  If I choose to activate a Chamber in which my opponent is the majority player, can I choose how to place her rewards along the new edge? Or is that placement always her prerogative, even if she’s not the player that performs the activation?
A:  The owner gets to place them, not the active player. —Matt Hyra

Q:  When you collect rewards, do ALL of them go in the newly recycled Chamber, or can you spread out your rewards along the entire edge?
A:  You can spread them out. —Matt Hyra
And don’t forget to place your rewards at the new edge BEFORE recycling the activated Test Chamber. —Jeep Barnett


Q:  So, if a room is activated that would normally give me 2 new Test Subjects, but I already have all 8 of mine in the laboratory, then I have no miniatures to spawn those rewards. Next, the room gets recycled, killing my 2 Test Subjects. Is it correct that I would end up with only 6 subjects in the laboratory?
A:  That’s correct. Collecting rewards is done during the “Activate” step of your turn; the subjects on the activated room will not be removed from play until the “Recycle” step. —Ryan Skinner

Q:  Are rewards optional? Do you have to add Test Subjects and/or Cake when you get them as rewards, or can you opt not to take them?
A:  My vote is that you must “earn” them. It does not say may earn, just “earn.” Also, it seems more in keeping with the theme that there is no choice in the matter. —WBRP
Yes. —chengr05
One reason the game does not end too quickly is that earning the final Cake needed to win also often puts new Test Subjects into the laboratory. This encourages strategic thinking and planning. It also makes the Chambers that yield Cake but not followers particularly valuable, which is probably why they are so rare (only four out of 36). This all seems quite intentional in a very purposefully designed and carefully tuned game engine. —Ed.

Turret tokens

Q:  Are the rooms containing Portals also considered to be adjacent for Turret movement?
A:  The Portals make 2 Chambers adjacent. The Turret sees this just like a Test Subject would. So, yes, the Turret uses the Portals. —Matt Hyra

Q:  Does a Turret permanently destroy a Test Subject?
A:  The Test Subjects immediately go back to their owner’s supply, and can be earned again later. Test Subjects never get “permanently” incinerated like Cake Slices. —NocturnalCarnivore

Winning the game

Q:  Do you have to have Test Subjects on the board to be eligible to win? My son eliminated all of his guys and the game was over AND he had the most Cake. So did he win, or did the person with Test Subjects win?
A:  You can win without having any Test Subjects on the board. In fact it is a sound strategy to kill off your own Test Subjects as soon as you have the most Cake. —NocturnalCarnivore


Specific Aperture and Character Cards

Aerial Faith Plate	Move one Test Subject of any color to an adjacent Chamber!

Q:  An opponent used an Aerial Faith Plate and said that my Test Subject was going to carry her Cake Slice, but I thought that considering I could choose which Cake to take if there were more than one, it would also be my decision for the subject to take no Cake as well.
A:  Yes, it should have been your choice to carry or not carry Cake as the owner of the Test Subject. —grant5

Announcer	Instead of incinerating Cake in a recycled Chamber, it is returned to the owner’s earnable Cake reserves.

Q:  Does the singular “owner” in the text for the Announcer mean that this effect is optional on a per-player basis?
A:  It affects all players and all Cakes. —Matt Hyra

Chell	 Once, at the start of each player’s turn, they may move one Portal token to any Chamber.

Q:  Chell says I can move one Portal token to ANY Chamber... does this include an old-edge Chamber?
A:  Yes. The Chell card allows you to move only one Portal, but you can move it to the old edge of the laboratory, which your Portal Gun wouldn’t normally let you do. —NocturnalCarnivore

Curiosity Core	 Once, at the start of each player’s turn, they may cycle the top Aperture Card to the bottom of the stack.

Q:  When I consider using the Curiosity Core, do I get to look at the Aperture Card under the top one and then decide? Or do I have to make the decision without looking?
A:  You must decide without looking. —Matt Hyra

Excursion Funnel	In a single row of Chambers, move any number of your Test Subjects one Chamber toward the old edge of the Laboratory.

Q:  Does an Excursion Funnel restrict all Test Subjects to movement within the single row, or can they move diagonally to another row? Additionally, are they bound by the regular rule that they all must move to the same Chamber?
A:  The intent is that you would move any number of your Test Subjects in a single row one Chamber forward in that same row. This is a special action, so it’s separate from the restrictions of a normal Move action. —Jeep Barnett



Q:  Can you use an Excursion Funnel to “relay” a Cake Slice multiple Chambers toward its doom if you have Test Subjects in adjacent chambers along the row and you begin with the one farthest from the old edge?
A:  The movement is simultaneous. You can't chain carry a Cake Slice. Think of it as a conveyor belt. —Matt Hyra

Fact Core	The normal turn sequence has been modified! Instead of taking your Move action second, you must take your Move action last.

Q:  When the active player reveals the Fact Core (and assuming that they do not then deploy another Aperture Card to reveal a different Character), is the sequence of their current turn modified even though it was already in progress?
A:  Yes, the turn that is already underway will be affected. —Matt Hyra

Frankenturret	 Once, at the start of each player’s turn, they may swap one Aperture Card with another player’s Card.

Q:  Does the Frankenturret require the player to swap one of their own Aperture Cards from their hand with another player’s card, or can they take the top Aperture Card from the stack and swap that card with another player’s card?
A:  Swap between player hands. —Matt Hyra

Q:  If the other player has 2 copies of the same Aperture Card, can I read the Characters on the back sides, or do I just have to pick one of the Cards and get a random Character on the back?
A:  You don’t get to see the Character side. They can legally hide that from you. —Matt Hyra

Q:  If I have more than one card myself, do I also get to choose which of my Cards I give to the other player, or can the other player choose it?
A:  You get to choose both cards. If you have two copies of the same Aperture Card, you may of course consider the Characters on the backs of your cards when deciding. —Ed.

Greg	 Once, at the start of each player’s turn, they may choose to destroy one of their Test Subjects to reveal any other previously discarded
Character as the new active Character and restart their turn.

Q:  After you switch Greg for another Character, can you use that Character’s “start of turn” power?
A:  Normally no, because normally new Characters come into play after the start of the turn. But the last 4 words specifically state that you “restart” your turn, so you can benefit from the new Character’s ability immediately. The wording is specifically designed to make sure you get any “start of turn” abilities from the new Character you select. —void_presence, svardosi, & Logan8




Redirection Cube	Destroy one Test Subject, Turret, or Companion Cube in any Chamber.

Q:  When the Companion Cube or the Turret is “destroyed,” does this mean the token is removed from the Laboratory but not permanently incinerated? So later on, it could be brought back into the Laboratory as a reward, or via an Aperture or Character card effect?
A:  Correct. It just leaves play when destroyed. —Matt Hyra
Only Cake is ever permanently incinerated. The Enrichment Center has plenty of expendable Cubes and Turrets. And Test Subjects. —Ed.

Repulsion Gel	Move all Test Subjects from a single Chamber to one adjacent Chamber of your choosing!

Q:  When Test Subjects of multiple colors are forced to move at the same time, in what order do their owners make their Cake-carrying decisions?
A:  Priority should go to the left of the active player. —Matt Hyra
Note that Matt’s answer implies that the opponents closer to the active player’s left choose earlier in the sequence, and the active player herself chooses last. This is actually to her advantage: since all the Cake that gets carried will end up in the same place, choosing last affords the most control over which Slices get moved. —Ed.

Rick	 Once, at the start of each player’s turn, they may choose to Incinerate one of their Cake Slices to earn 2 Aperture Cards.

Q:  If Rick brings your hand above 3 cards, when you discard the excess is this actually a deployment? If not, does the Character card on top of the discard stack still take effect? Or do you just not get to gain additional cards?
A:  Sorry, the limit was a late change and we must have missed this inconsistency in review. Any time you would earn a card that takes you above 3 you don’t earn the card and it stays on the draw deck. There is no discarding down to 3 and I can’t think of a case that should allow it. —Jeep Barnett

Wheatley	Rewards from an activated Chamber are earned by the player with the minority of Test Subjects in that Chamber.

Q:  Does 0 count as a minority? Or do you need at least one piece on the Chamber to have the “minority”?
A:  Must have at least one. Nobody gets it if tied. —grant5

Q:  So, what does that mean if there is only one player’s piece(s) in the room? Can you be the majority AND the minority at the same time?
A:  It grants the benefits to the minority only, so majority doesn’t matter. If you are the only one there, you have the minority. —Matt Hyra

When deploying an Aperture Card you may choose to ignore the actions printed on the Card and instead deploy your Portal Gun. This allows you to place the two Portal tokens in any two Chambers, excluding the old edge.

SETUP — Laboratory: 5 wide x 3 high (3 left removed)
Portal Tokens: go in top/bottom of “old edge” rooms
Aperture Cards: shuffled and placed white sides up
1* Player: Player who ate cake last. Then all players
put 4 Test Subjects within 3 “new edge” Chambers.

 

GAMEPLAY — Players take turns of these 4 steps:
1) Deploy Aperture Cards — You may play any cards
you have. Discard pile shows new character’s rule.
2) Move group of Test Subjects to adjacent Chamber
(NOTE: Portals make Test Chambers adjacent too)
a. If 1 Subject moved gain 1 card (max. hand of 3)
or 1 Test Subject placed on the “new edge”
b. Each Subject can carry 1 of Cake of any color
3) Activate Chamber using GLaDOS. A player with
majority there gets rewards (ties = no rewards).
[CUBE: place = no rewards / TURRET: move = kill]
4) Recycle activated Test Chamber by flipping and
placing it on “old edge” (rows must be 3 long)
a. Subjects removed, but Cake Incinerated
b. Portal/Cube/Turret remain after flipped

 

END — When any player has 0 Test Subjects in lab.
WIN — Player with most cake in lab when game ends!
[Tie? = most Test Subjects, then...well, see rulebook]
