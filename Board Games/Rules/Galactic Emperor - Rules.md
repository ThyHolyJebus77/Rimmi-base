## Comparisons to Civilization 5/6
- Both games feature exploration, expansion, exploitation, and extermination (4X) gameplay.
- Galactic Emperor uses a role selection mechanic, unlike Civ's turn-based structure.
- Technology advancement is simpler in Galactic Emperor, with one-time purchases rather than a tech tree.
- Combat in Galactic Emperor is dice-based, while Civ uses unit strength comparisons.
- Resource management is more streamlined in Galactic Emperor, focusing on food, metal, and energy.

### Why Play Galactic Emperor Over Civilization?

1. **Faster Gameplay:** Galactic Emperor offers a complete 4X experience in about 90 minutes, compared to Civilization's multi-hour sessions. It's perfect for those who want a space empire experience without committing to a full day of gaming.

2. **Simplified Resource Management:** With only three main resources (food, metal, energy) and Galactic Marks, Galactic Emperor streamlines the economic aspect while still offering strategic depth. This makes it more accessible for new players or those who prefer less micromanagement.

3. **Dynamic Role Selection:** Unlike Civilization's fixed turn structure, Galactic Emperor's role selection mechanic adds a layer of strategy and player interaction. Choosing when to take certain actions and anticipating opponents' choices creates engaging gameplay.

4. **Focused Technology System:** Instead of navigating a complex tech tree, players can purchase powerful one-time use technology cards. This system allows for quicker strategic pivots and more immediate impacts on gameplay.

5. **Higher Player Interaction:** The game's design encourages more direct conflict and negotiation between players through combat, political influence, and role selection. This creates a more socially engaging experience compared to Civilization's often parallel play style.

6. **Modular Board:** The sector tile system creates a unique galaxy layout each game, offering high replayability and forcing players to adapt their strategies to new spatial configurations.

7. **Tabletop Experience:** As a board game, Galactic Emperor offers a tactile, face-to-face gaming experience that digital Civilization games can't replicate. It's great for game nights and social gatherings.

8. **Balanced Strategies:** While Civilization often favors certain victory conditions, Galactic Emperor provides multiple viable paths to victory, balancing military, economic, and political strategies more evenly.

9. **Space Theme:** For those who prefer sci-fi to historical settings, Galactic Emperor offers a compelling space empire experience with diverse ships and technologies.

10. **Easier to Learn:** With its streamlined systems and focused gameplay, Galactic Emperor is generally easier to teach and learn than the complex Civilization series, making it more accessible to a wider range of players.

## Factions/Civilizations
There are no distinct factions or civilizations with gameplay differences in Galactic Emperor. Players start with identical capabilities and differentiate through their choices during the game.

## Additional Information
The game features a unique "Black Hole" mechanic that can drastically change the board state when revealed. The Throne card determines turn order and provides a tiebreaker in conflicts. The Explorer role eventually becomes a second Warlord role, increasing the game's focus on combat in later stages.

# Galactic Emperor - Rules
## Setup

Each player chooses a color and takes all **ships** , a
**reference card** , a **Home Starbase token** and a number
of **Empire tokens** of that color:

```
3 players: 11 Empire tokens
4 players: 10 Empire tokens
5 players: 9 Empire tokens
6 players: 8 Empire tokens
```
The solid color side of an Empire token is an **Empire** ,
the symbol side is a **Starbase**.

A player **controls** a planet sector if he has an Empire
or Starbase on it. Sector tiles without planets cannot
be controlled.

Place the **home sector** tiles matching each player’s
color and the **Omega sun** tile and place them on the
board, following the diagrams on page 3 of the rules.

Set aside the **Black Hole** tile. Shuffle the remaining
sector tiles into 2 facedown stacks: plain backs, and
atomic symbol on backs (including unused home
sectors). Put the Black Hole tile facedown on top of
the atomic stack and the plain stack on top of that.

Turn faceup 1 sector tile for each person playing, plus
1 more.

Place the Technology cards faceup near the board.

Place the **Role cards** , **Galactic Marks** , **Resources**
and a number of faceup **Victory Points** (VP) on their
labelled pools on the board. The _Explorer/Warlord_ Role
card starts with the _Explorer_ side faceup.

```
3 players: 115 Victory Points
4 players: 130 Victory Points
5 players: 145 Victory Points
6 players: 160 Victory Points
```
VP totals are kept secret during the game, but all
other player items must be kept in clear view.

Each player takes 5 Marks, and places 1 blue **metal**
and 1 yellow **energy** resource cube on a **Storage
Facility card** (its capacity is 3 energy and 6 metal).

Choose a player to receive the **Throne card**.

## Game Rounds

At the start of each round, the player with the Throne
card points the **Direction marker** to the left or right to
indicate the direction of play.

The Throne holder then chooses a **role**. The choosing
player receives a **special ability** bonus on his turn,
then everyone takes the action allowed for that role, in
the order indicated by the Direction marker.

```
After everyone takes the action, the next player in
the turn order chooses a role and the process repeats
(with the choosing player taking his action first).
```
```
At the beginning of the game there are 7 roles. When
the Explorer role is finished, it is flipped to become
a second Warlord. The Scientist is removed from the
game when the Omega Sun explodes.
```
```
End of the Round
The round ends when the last player chooses a role
and everyone takes its action. Then:
```
**1.** If the _Explorer_ role was not chosen, turn up 1 more
    sector tile.
**2.** Put all chosen roles back in the pool.
**3.** Each player receives 2 marks from the bank.
**4.** Pass the Direction marker to the player who now
    holds the Throne card.
A new round begins and play continues.

## Explorer

```
Each player selects 1 sector tile from the faceup tiles,
and places it on an empty space on the board.
```
```
Special Ability: Immediately claim the sector you
select with one of your Empire tokens (unless the
sector is placed under enemy ships). Also, place
all leftover turned-up sector tiles after everyone has
chosen a tile.
```
```
After all tiles are placed, turn faceup 1 sector tile for
each person playing, plus 1 more.
```
```
When all of the sector tiles are on the board, flip the
Explorer role over.
```
```
The Black Hole
The player who chooses the Black Hole tile (when it is
faceup and available) swaps it with the central Omega
Sun tile. Remove the Scientist role from the game.
```
## Merchant

```
Special Ability: Receive 3 marks from the bank. Then
set the current price for each resource by rolling 4
dice. Discard one, and assign the remaining 3 to the
market spaces on the board—the lowest to food , the
middle to metal , and the highest to energy.
```
```
Each player may then:
Harvest Food: Take the amount of green food cubes
shown on your controlled sectors from the pool.
You may also collect food placed during a previous
Merchant role on controlled sectors.
```
```
Buy and Sell: Buy and sell resources as much as
desired. Sold resources are returned to the pool;
purchased metal and energy are placed in your
Storage Facility (do not exceed its capacity).
```
```
Fund Metal/Energy Production: Put food cubes on
your controlled sectors that generate metal/energy.
These sectors can hold a maximum of 2 food cubes.
Any excess food must then be sold (returned to the
pool) for the current market price.
```
## Steward

```
Special Ability: Immediately place 1 metal or energy
resource, for free, in your Storage Facility (do not
exceed its capacity).
```
```
Each player may produce metal and energy. Return
1 food from each controlled sector to the pool to
produce the metal and/or energy shown. You cannot
remove more than 1 food per sector. Place the blue
and yellow cubes shown in your Storage Facility (do
not exceed its capacity). Discard excess to the pool.
```
## Engineer

```
Special Ability: Take a free fighter is one is available
in your reserve, and immediately deploy it to one of
your Starbases.
```
```
Players may build as many ships as they can afford ,
but your total force may not exceed your reserve of
8 fighters, 4 cruisers, and 2 dreadnoughts. Pay with
resources from your Storage Facility and marks from
your supply.
```
```
Purchased ships are deployed on any sector where you
have a Starbase. There is no limit to the number of
ships that can be placed on a tile. You cannot deploy
ships to an Empire.
```
## Warlord

```
Moving
Players may move any of their ships, in any order,
into empty spaces and sector tiles. Sun tiles can be
skipped (they do not count as a space).
Fighters move up to 2 spaces
Cruisers move up to 2 spaces
Dreadnoughts move 1 space
Empires and Starbases cannot move
```
```
When one of your ships moves into an unprotected
sector with at least 1 planet, place an Empire tokens
there to claim it. The ships may continue to move.
Ships stop and cannot move further when they move
to a space with enemy forces. Combat must then be
resolved before the end of your turn.
```
```
You cannot move into or attack an enemy home sector
tile.
```
```
The Black Hole
When ships move into the Black Hole and end the
Warlord role there, they may warp to anywhere in
the galaxy except Home or Sun sectors on your
next Warlord turn. All warping ships go to the same
destination and may not move further that turn.
```
```
If ships warp directly into combat they immediately
get one free attack and cannot retreat. The defender
cannot return fire but still chooses which units are hit.
Combat then begins as normal.
Firing
Fighters hit on a 5-6 on a 6-sided die. All other units
hit on a 4-6.
```

**Special Ability:** Gain an extra die for 1 ship during
each battle when _attacking_ (the ship can change on
subsequent attacks; choose before phase 1, below).

**1. Dreadnoughts** fire 3 dice; then remove casualties.
**2. Cruisers** fire 2 dice, **Empires** fire 2 dice, and
    **Starbases** fire 3 dice; then remove casualties.
**3. Fighters** fire 1 die; then remove casualties.

The attacker then decides whether to continue the
combat or retreat to their previous sector. Defenders,
and attackers who warp moved into combat, cannot
retreat.

**Removing Casualties**
Attacker and defender combat rolls are resolved
simultaneously in each phase. Players choose which of
their units are hit; but an Empire may not be assigned
hits until all of the defender’s ships are destroyed.

**Fighters** , **Cruisers** and **Empires** are killed by a hit.

**Dreadnoughts** are flipped on the first hit, killed on the
second. If it survives the battle, it repairs and flips
back to normal.

**Starbases** are flipped on the first hit, turning into
**Empires**. They do not repair after a battle.

All casualties are returned to their owner’s supplies.

**Ending Combat**
If the attacker wins in a planet sector, he claims it
with one of his Empire tokens.

If the attacker destroys an enemy Empire, he gets 1 VP.

The defender never receives an award, nor is there a
reward is both sides destroy each other.

## Regent

The current owner of the Throne card must place it
next to the board.

**1. Gain Influence
All players draw 2 Empire tokens from their reserve to
use as political influence**.

In player order, each player decides whether to buy
1 (and only 1) extra token. The cost for this extra
influence starts at 2 marks, but rises by 1 mark each
time influence is purchased.

**2. Exert Influence**
In player order (except the chooser of _Regent_ goes last),
each player decides which planet sectors to influence.
Influence may also be placed on the Throne card.

**Special Ability:** Each Empire you place counts as 1
influence, as Empires on the board do. A Starbase
already on the board counts as 2 influence.

You may spread your influence around or put it all
in one sector. You may put it on your own sectors to
upgrade them to Starbases; expand your territory by
putting it on uncontrolled planet sectors; influence
enemy planet sectors to downgrade an enemy
Starbase to an Empire, or eliminate an enemy Empire.

You cannot put influence on a player’s home sector.

**3. Resolve Conflicts**
If 2 or more players have influence on a sector or
the Throne card, remove influence from each player
evenly until only 1 player has influence left.

```
If they both have the same amount, the sector or
Throne card will be left empty. Removed tokens are
returned to player reserves.
```
```
Claim Sectors: If you have 1 influence left on a sector,
leave your Empire token on the sector to gain control.
If you have 2+ left, leave a Starbase and take back
any excess tokens.
```
```
If you lose control of a planet sector where you have
ships, you must immediately move them to your
nearest Starbase (choose one if more than one are
equally distant). The Starbase must have existed
before resolving influence.
Claim the Throne: If you have 1 or more influence left
on the Throne card, take back your Empire tokens and
take the card. If no one has influence on it, the card
goes to the player who chose the Regent role.
```
```
Victory Count
Players score 1 VP for each planet they control with
an Empire or Starbase (some sectors have 2 planets).
```
## Scientist

```
Players can buy 1 Technology card.
```
```
Special Ability: Purchase 1 Technology card for 1 less
energy (this may reduce the cost to nothing).
```
```
Ambassador ( Regent role)
Immediately after an enemy places an influence tile
on a sector (you need not control it, but it cannot be a
home sector), interrupt saying “no, that’s my personal
business”, and the opponent must move the token
elsewhere.
Only you may put influence on that sector for the rest
of the Regent role.
```
```
Shield Generators ( Warlord role)
Ignore the first hit on your fleet in each battle. If you
only have an Empire or a Starbase at the start of a
battle, shield generators do not work.
```
```
Ion Cannons ( Warlord role)
Your Empires fire 3 dice and your Starbases fire 4
dice in combat.
```
```
Plasma Weapons ( Warlord role)
When your ships attack in combat, add +1 to each
die result (Dreadnoughts and Cruisers hit on 3-6),
Fighters on 4-6). Plasma weapons do not work when
defending.
```
```
Fusion Engines ( Warlord role)
All of your ships can move 1 extra space.
```
```
Robotics ( Engineer role)
Subtract 2 metal from the total cost of all ship
purchases this turn (not per ship).
```
```
Protein Fields ( Steward role)
Produce metal and/or energy from any 2 sectors
without discarding a food resource.
```
```
Saboteur ( Anytime)
Stop the use of 1 Technology card for the rest of the
round (can be used only once per round). This is used
automatically after a player declares they are using
a technology. Afterwards, the victimized player may
attempt to catch the Saboteur, rolling 1 die: on a 5-6,
the Saboteur is caught and removed from the game.
```
```
Diplomat ( Regent role)
Your extra political influence token always costs 2
marks (the next player’s influence cost is increased
as normal).
```
```
Time Warp ( Anytime)
Re-roll one die result this round (can be used only
once per round). If you dislike the new result, you can
re-roll the die one more time. Time Warp can be used
on anyone’s die result. If used during the Merchant
role, it must be activated before any dice results are
assigned to resource prices.
```
```
Space Pirate ( Merchant role)
Take 1 metal resource from an opponent’s Storage
Facility or 1 food from an opponent’s sector.
```
```
Long Range Scanners ( Explorer role)
When you choose a turned-up sector tile during the
Explorer role, you may draw 1 sector tile from the top
of the tile stack that only you see. Choose 1 of these
sector tiles and put the other back on top of the tile
stack. If you choose the Explorer role, this technology
applies only to the first sector tile you select.
```
```
This tech cannot affect the Black Hole. If you draw
the Black Hole, you must put it back on top of the
stack and choose an already turned up tile.
```
## Game End and Victory

```
The game is over when a player:
a. Place his last Empire token to establish control of a
planet sector.
b. Takes the last Victory Point chit from the pool.
```
```
Every player finishes taking a turn for that role.
If the game ends during Warlord or Explorer , take a
final victory count. Each player is awarded 1 VP for
each planet he controls (some sectors have 2 planets).
If the game ends during Regent , do not take a final
victory count (a count is already part of the role).
```
```
All players with full Storage Facilities receive 1 VP.
The player with the most marks receives 2 VP (on a
tie, each receives 1 VP).
VPs are received even if the VP chits are depleted.
```
```
The winner is the player with the most Victory Points.
On a tie, the entire remaining space fleets of the 2
tied players with the most controlled sectors move to
a neutral sector to battle to determine the winner.
```

The player with the Throne card points the **Direction
marker** to indicate the direction of play.

He then chooses a **role**. The chooser receives a **special
ability** bonus, then everyone takes the role’s action,
in Direction marker order. The next player in order
chooses a role and the process repeats (the choosing
player takes his action first). After the last player:

If the _Explorer_ was not chosen, turn up 1 more sector
tile. Put all chosen roles back in the pool. Each player
receives 2 marks. The Throne card holder takes the
Direction marker. A new round begins.

## Explorer

## Regent

**1. Gain Influence
All players take 2 Empire tokens as political influence**.

In player order, each player may 1 extra influence
token, starting at 2 marks, +1 mark per purchase.

**2. Exert Influence**
In player order (except the chooser of _Regent_ goes last),
each player decides which planet sectors to influence.
Influence may also be placed on the Throne card. You
cannot put influence on a player’s home sector.

**Special Ability:** Each Empire you place counts as 1
influence. A Starbase on the board counts as 2.

**3. Resolve Conflicts**
Remove influence from each player evenly until only 1
player has influence left.

**Claim Sectors:** If you have 1 influence left on a sector,
leave your Empire token there to gain control. If you
have 2+ left, leave a Starbase. If you lose control
of a planet sector where you have ships, you must
immediately move them to your nearest Starbase that
existed before resolving influence.

**Claim the Throne:** If you have influence left on the
Throne card, take the card. If no one has influence, it
goes to the player who chose the _Regent_ role.

**Victory Count: Score 1 VP for each planet you control
with an Empire or Starbase**.
