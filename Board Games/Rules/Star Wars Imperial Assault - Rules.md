# Star Wars Imperial Assault - Rules

[[Star Wars Imperial Assault.pdf]]

## ORDER OF PLAY

## ACTIVATION PHASE

Play alternates back and forth; in a campaign, starting
with the Rebel players. **When a hero is activated:**

**1. Start of Activation:** Ready all of the hero’s exhausted
    Class and Item cards.
**2. Perform Actions:** Perform any combination of up to 2 of
    these actions with the hero: **move** , **attack** , **interact** , **rest** ,
    and **special**.

When a hero is activated, flip his **activation token** to the
red side. If a hero has 2 activation tokens, he cannot
resolve his second activation until after each hero has
resolved its first activation. In a 3 hero game, the Rebel
players choose 1 hero to claim a second activation token at
the end of each round.

**The Imperial player then chooses 1 deployment card to
activate**. The number of bars below the card’s deployment
cost is the number of figures in its **deployment group**.
Perform up to 2 actions with each figure in the group in
the order of your choice. Resolve both actions for a figure
before choosing the next figure.

When the last figure from a Deployment card is activated,
**exhaust** the card (rotate it 90º). The corresponding figures
cannot be activated again during this round.

Players alternate activating figures in this way until all
figures have been activated.

Each action must be resolved completely before a figure
performs its next action.

## MOVE

A figure performing a **move** gains MPs equal to its **Speed**.
A figure can move to an orthogonally or diagonally adjacent
space by spending 1 MP. MPs may be spent before or after
performing an action.

**A hero (only) may suffer 1 strain during his activation to
gain 1 MP**. He may do this up to twice per activation.

A figure can move into a space occupied by a friendly or
neutral figure at no additional cost. **A figure can move into
a space occupied by a hostile figure, but must spend 1
additional MP to do so**. A figure cannot end its movement
in a space containing another figure.

A figure cannot move through the diagonal intersection of
walls, blocking terrain, or impassable terrain.

**Walls (black line):** Spaces separated by a wall are _not_
adjacent. Figures cannot move through or trace LOS
through walls.

**Impassable (dotted red line):** Figures cannot move through
dotted red lines. Spaces separated by impassable terrain
are adjacent. LOS can be traced through impassable terrain.

**Blocked (red line):** Figures cannot enter or trace LOS
through blocking terrain.

**Doors (door token):** Spaces separated by a door are _not_
adjacent. Figures cannot move through or trace LOS
through doors.

**Difficult (blue line):** A figure must spend 1 additional MP
to enter difficult terrain; LOS can be traced through it.

## ATTACK

**1. Declare Target:** choose an eligible hostile target.
Each attack is either a **melee** or a **ranged attack**.
Melee attacks can target adjacent figures or objects only.
Ranged attacks _may_ target adjacent figures or objects.

```
When performing a ranged attack, the target must be
in line of sight (LOS). The attacking player chooses one
corner of his figure’s space. Trace 2 straight, uninterrupted
lines to 2 different corners of the target’s space. These
cannot overlap and cannot be traced through walls,
blocked terrain, spaces containing figures, or through the
diagonal intersection of walls or blocking terrain.
```
**2. Roll Dice:** The attacker rolls the **attack dice** listed on
his Deployment card (Imperial figures or allies) or weapon
Item card (heroes). The defender simultaneously rolls the
**defense dice** listed on his Deployment card or Hero sheet.
**3. Rerolls:** Resolve dice reroll effects. Each die may be
rerolled only once per attack regardless of who rerolls it.
**4. Apply Modifiers:
Evade** Each evade icon cancels one result.
**Dodge** The attack is a miss.
**5. Spend Surges:
Surge** The attacker can spend to trigger special
abilities. **A hero may spend up to 1 to recover 1**.
**6. Check Accuracy:** On a ranged attack, the **accuracy** (the
sum of the numbers and any modifiers) must be equal to or
greater than the number of spaces the target is away from
the attacker (the **distance** ). If it is not, the attack is a miss.
**7. Calculate Damage:** The target suffers **damage** equal
to the number of icons rolled by the attacker minus
the number of **block** icons rolled by the defender. If the
attack is a **miss** , the target suffers 0 damage.

```
Only heroes can use both of their actions to perform
attacks during the same activation. If a special action
involves one or more attacks, this does count as the figure
using an action to attack.
```
## INTERACT

```
Figures can interact with a token in their space or in an
adjacent space.
Crates: A hero can interact with a crate to draw 1 Supply
card and place it faceup near his Hero sheet. You may use
the card’s ability. Then claim the crate token by placing
it by your Hero sheet. A crate token with its colored side
down cannot be examined by players.
Doors: A figure can interact with a door to open it. Return
the door to the box. Figures cannot voluntarily close doors.
Special: A figure can interact with other tokens on the
map, as stated in the mission. If there is an attribute icon
listed, the figure must pass the corresponding attribute
test to resolve the interact effect.
```
## REST

```
Only heroes can rest. By resting, a hero can recover
equal to his endurance. If a hero recovers in excess of
the number of strain tokens he has, he recovers damage
equal to the amount of excess.
```
During campaign missions, heroes can suffer **strain** (^)
to resolve some abilities.

## SPECIAL

```
Class cards, abilities, and mission rules with a allow
figures to perform special actions. An ability with
requires both of a figure’s actions to resolve. Each special
action can only be performed once per activation.
```
## STATUS PHASE

```
After all figures have resolved their activations, players
ready all exhausted Deployment cards (rotate upright) and
activation tokens (flip to their green side).
```
## ABILITIES

```
Abilities provide special effects beyond the standard rules.
If the requirements of an ability cannot be met, it cannot
be performed. If an ability is ‘used’ , it can be triggered
multiple times each round, but only once per timing
instance.
```
```
The hero must suffer the listed amount of
(without exceeding his endurance) to use the ability.
```
```
The Imperial player must spend the listed amount of
threat to use the ability.
```
```
These abilities are performed as an action and can
be performed only once per activation.
```
```
These abilities can be used by spending results
during an attack. The number of the attacker can
spend during the attack is equal to the amount of
rolled minus the number of evades rolled.
```
```
Each ability can be triggered only once per attack.
```
```
Exhaust: You must exhaust the card to use this ability.
```
```
Deplete: You must deplete the card to use this ability.
```
```
An ability that can be used ‘during your activation’ can
be used before or after performing an action during an
activation. It cannot be used while resolving an action.
```
```
An ability that causes figures to suffer damage is not
considered to be an attack.
```
## STRAIN AND ENDURANCE

```
All heroes can choose to suffer to use abilities and to
move additional spaces.
```
```
A hero can only optionally suffer an amount of up to his
endurance. If any effect forces a figure to suffer that
would exceed its endurance, the figure suffers equal to
the amount of excess.
```
## DAMAGE AND DEFEAT

## DAMAGE & STRAIN

```
When you suffer damage or strain , place that
number of corresponding tokens on your Hero sheet.
For other figures, tokens are placed on the map next to
the figure. When a figure recovers or , discard the
appropriate number of tokens.
If a figure suffers outside of an attack, the is not
prevented by , and the figure does not roll defense dice.
If a hero recovers in excess of the number of strain
tokens he has, he recovers equal to the amount of
excess.
```
```
If an object suffers equal to or greater than its Health,
it is destroyed and removed from the map.
```
## INCAPACITATED

```
An incapacitated figure remains on the map and does
not restrict movement or block LOS, though other figures
cannot end their movement in the space. The figure
discards all conditions, and conditions cannot be applied
to it. It cannot suffer or be targeted or affected by
anything except as specified by the mission’s rules.
However it can still be pushed by a Massive figure ending
its movement in its space.
```

## DEFEAT

When a figure has suffered damage equal to its Health,
it is immediately **defeated**. Excess damage is ignored.

When a hero is **defeated** , he becomes **wounded**. When
any other figure is defeated, it is removed from the map.
During a campaign, when the last Imperial figure in a **non-
unique** group is defeated, the corresponding deployment
card is returned to the Imperial player’s hand and can be
optionally deployed later in the mission.

A hero defeated for the first time during a mission discards
all damage tokens from his Hero sheet and flips his Hero
sheet to the **wounded** side. If there are more strain tokens
on your Hero sheet than your Endurance value, discard
the excess tokens. A hero who is wounded follows all rules
for activation and can still suffer. If a wounded hero is
defeated, he **withdraws**.

A hero who **withdraws** removes his figure from the map and
is eliminated from the mission, but still receives all hero
rewards at the end of the mission.

## ATTRIBUTE TESTS

Only heroes roll dice for **attribute tests**. Roll the dice listed
for the listed attribute on your Hero sheet. If you roll at
least 1 , you pass the test. If you roll no , you fail.

If a test lists a number directly before the icon, that
number of successes are needed in order to pass the test.
If you do not roll the required number of successes, you
fail the test but place 1 token near the test subject for
each success. The next time a figure attempts this test,
discard these tokens and apply +1 to your results for
each token discarded.

**An elite figure required to perform an attribute test
automatically receives 1 success**. A regular figure required
to perform a test automatically fails the test.

## ITEM RESTRICTIONS

Heroes can possess an unlimited number of Item cards,
but each hero can only bring a limited number to an
individual mission:

```
1 Armor card
```
2 Weapon cards
(any card with an attack type followed by dice icons)

3 Equipment cards

Before deploying, heroes may give any of their Item cards,
except those from a Class or Reward deck, to other heroes.
Item cards cannot be traded during a mission.

**Modifications** are items placed below a weapon that
provide the listed ability to the weapon. Each weapon can
have a limited number of modifications (listed as a number
of bars in the card’s bottom right corner).

An Item card cannot have more than 1 modification with
the same trait attached to it at the same time, excluding
the _Modification_ trait.

## LARGE FIGURES

A figure that occupies more than 1 space on the map is a
**large figure**. When a large figure attacks, LOS may be traced
from any single space it occupies. A figure attacking a large
figure can target any 1 space the large figure occupies.

A large figure cannot move diagonally. While moving, a
large figure cannot rotate its base unless it spends 1 MP;
and when doing so must occupy at least half of the spaces
it occupied before the rotation.

## KEYWORDS

## BLAST

```
If the target of this attack suffers 1 or more , each
figure and object adjacent to the target space suffers
equal to the Blast value (not prevented by ). If the
target is a large figure, Blast only affects figures adjacent
to the targeted space and does not affect the target figure.
If an attack inflicts a condition, it is applied only to the
target of the attack and not to figures affected by Blast.
```
## CLEAVE

```
If the target of this attack suffers one or more , the
attacker may choose a different hostile eligible figure or
object to suffer the listed (not prevented by ).
If an attack inflicts a condition, it is applied only to the
target of the attack and not to figures affected by Cleave.
```
## MASSIVE

```
Figures do not block LOS to or from a Massive figure.
During a campaign, Massive figures cannot enter interior
spaces. They can move through and end their movement on
spaces with blocking and impassable terrain or other figures
(not Massive figures), and can enter spaces containing
hostile figures and difficult terrain at no additional MP cost.
Any figures in a Massive figure’s spaces are pushed into the
closest empty space of its controller’s choice. The player
moving the Massive figure pushes friendly figures first, and
then other players push their figures. After a Massive figure
ends its movement in spaces containing at least 1 other
figure, it cannot move any more during this activation.
If a Massive figure occupies a space containing blocking
terrain, LOS can be traced to that figure, spaces can be
counted to it, and adjacent figures can attack it.
```
## MOBILE

```
This figure ignores additional movement costs when entering
difficult terrain and spaces containing hostile figures. It
can also enter, move through and end its movement in
impassable spaces and edges and blocking terrain. If it is
in blocking terrain, LOS can be traced to the figure and
adjacent figures can attack it.
```
## PIERCE

```
This figure may ignore a number of results while
attacking. If the number of results is less than the Pierce
value, the excess has no effect. If multiple Pierce abilities
are used in an attack, their values are added together.
```
## REACH

```
The figure may perform melee attacks targeting figures
or objects up to 2 spaces away and in LOS. A Reach attack
does not require accuracy.
```
## CONDITIONS

```
When a hero gains a condition , he places the appropriate
Condition card by his Hero sheet; place an appropriate
condition token next to other figures. A figure cannot be
affected by multiple instances of the same condition.
If a keyword causes a condition, the target of the attack
must suffer 1 or more to trigger the condition (which is
applied after the attack resolves). A beneficial condition is
applied to the attacker and a harmful condition is applied
to the target.
```
## FOCUS

```
The figure receives an additional green die the next time it
attacks or performs a test. The condition is then discarded.
```
```
A figure with the Focus keyword may become focused after
attacking if the target suffers 1 or more.
```
## OTHER RULES

#### RETRIEVING TOKENS To retrieve a token, a figure must

```
perform an interact while on or adjacent to the token. Then
place the token on the figure’s base to denote the figure
is carrying it.
```
```
If the figure is defeated, the token is dropped in the
figure’s space and can be retrieved as above. Figures
cannot optionally drop tokens they are carrying.
```
#### CONTROLLING TOKENS AND SPACES To control a token or

```
space, there must be a friendly figure on or adjacent to the
token or space and no hostile figures on or adjacent to the
token or space.
```
#### TIMING When an ability interrupts another figure’s

```
activation , the current activation pauses while the
interrupting ability is resolved, then the activation
resumes. A figure’s action cannot be interrupted while the
figure is in a space containing another figure.
```
```
While attacking , resolve mission rules first, then attacker
effects, then defender effects.
```
```
In a campaign , resolve mission rules first (Imperial player
decides the order if several resolve at the same time), then
Imperial player effects, then Rebel player effects.
In a skirmish , resolve mission rules first (the player with
initiative decides the order if several resolve at the same
time), then effects from the player with initiative, then
effects from his opponent.
```
#### DEPLETED CARDS When a card is depleted , it is flipped

```
facedown and cannot be used for the remainder of the
mission. At the end of each mission, all depleted cards are
flipped faceup.
```
#### EXHAUST Cards are rotated 90º to mark that they are

```
exhausted; activation tokens are flipped red side up.
```
```
If all Deployment cards or activation tokens belonging to a
player are exhausted, he cannot use abilities that must be
used before, during, or after his figure activates.
```
#### INITIAL GROUPS When the last figure in an initial group is

```
defeated, the corresponding Deployment card is placed
in the Imperial player’s hand. He can deploy these figures
during optional deployments following normal deployment
rules.
```
#### NEUTRAL FIGURES No player controls a neutral figure, and

```
they cannot activate or perform actions. They cannot suffer
or be targeted by attacks, abilities, or any game effect
except as specified by the mission’s rules. Neutral figures
block LOS.
```
```
Figures can move through spaces containing neutral
figures at no additional MP cost.
```
#### PUSH The player resolving this ability moves the figure

```
the specified number of spaces in any direction. When
pushing a large figure, it cannot move diagonally and
cannot be rotated. If a non-ability effect pushes a figure,
such as a mission rule or if a door closes between 2 spaces
occupied by a large figure, the player controlling that figure
determines its placement.
```
#### CONTROL A player controls a deployment zone if there is

```
at least 1 friendly figure in any space of that deployment
zone and no hostile figures in any space of that zone.
```
#### CLASS CARDS If a hero has a class deck that includes item

```
cards with an XP cost, these can be purchased with XP like
any other Class card and sold for 50 credits like any other
item card without a listed credit cost.
```

## CAMPAIGN SETUP

Decide who is the **Imperial player**. All other players are
**Rebel heroes**. These roles stay the same for the entire
campaign.

If playing with 2 heroes, each hero gets a _Legendary_
Reward card. If playing with 3 heroes, each hero gets a
_Heroic_ Reward card.

If there is only 1 Rebel player, he separately controls 2
heroes.

A hero who has 2 activation tokens flips only 1 token
facedown after resolving an activation (he will be able
to activate twice each round). A hero cannot perform his
second activation until each hero has performed his first
activation.

Each Rebel player chooses 1 **Hero sheet** and his
matching **Class deck** and **hero figure**. Place the basic
Item cards (those with no XP cost) from your Class deck
faceup in front of you.

Set aside any Agenda card sets or a Side Mission cards
that have a time period range that doesn’t include the
time period of the campaign.

The Imperial player chooses 1 **Imperial Class deck**. Place
the basic Class card (the one with no XP cost) faceup in
front of you. Take all the **Agenda cards** , sort them by sets
of 3 cards each (upper-right corner) and choose 6 sets.
Shuffle the 18 cards to create the **Agenda deck**.

The Rebel players sort the **Side Mission cards** by color.
Create the **Side Mission deck** by shuffling together these
cards:

- Each red Side Mission card corresponding to their
    heroes.
- 4 green cards of the heroes’ choice. Heroes cannot
    choose more than one of these cards that rewards the
    same ally.
- 4 random gray cards (do not reveal these to any
    player).

Start with the Introductory mission of the campaign.

## MISSION SETUP

The information in the _Campaign Guide_ is secret and can
be read only by the Imperial player.

**Imperial player:**
Assemble the map using **map tiles** as shown in the
mission’s diagram, then place all tokens on the map as
indicated.

Set the **threat dial** to 0 and the **round dial** to 1.

Take all Deployment cards and sort them into groups as
listed in the _Deployment and Setup_ box of the mission:

```
Initial Groups: Place the listed Deployment cards
faceup. The corresponding figures will be deployed
on the map.
```
```
Reserved Groups: Secretly put the listed Deployment
cards in a facedown pile. The corresponding figures will
be placed on the map when dictated by the mission.
```
```
Open Groups: Secretly choose a number of the listed
Deployment cards as a secret hand that can be used to
deploy figures to the map during the Status phase.
You may choose any or Deployment cards.
However, unique (•) cards and allies must be earned as
mission rewards before being used as open groups.
```
```
Special Setup: Perform any listed instructions.
```
```
Deploy figures on the map as indicated in the diagram.
Those with a gray or black border correspond to a gray
Deployment card.
```
```
Place all dice, Condition and Supply decks, damage
tokens, strain tokens, and condition tokens within reach
of all players.
Read the Mission Briefing section aloud to the Rebel
players. If there are any map tiles in the diagram that
have names, indicate these tiles and names to all players.
Keep the rest of the mission rules to yourself until
instructed to resolve them.
```
```
Each Rebel player:
Each Rebel player chooses the Item cards they will
bring to the mission and places his hero figure in an
empty space as close to the entrance token as possible
(including the token’s space).
```
```
If they have earned an ally , they may then deploy it.
```
```
Each hero receives 1 activation token and places it ready
(green side faceup) on his Hero sheet.
```
```
Fewer than 4 heroes may receive additional activation
tokens as specified on their Legendary or Heroic Reward
cards.
```
## PLAYING CAMPAIGN MISSIONS

## CAMPAIGN STATUS PHASE

```
After each figure has resolved its activation, resolve these
steps before the next round begins:
```
**1. Increase Threat:** The Imperial player increases the
    threat dial by the threat level listed on the campaign
    log.
**2. Ready:** The Imperial player readies all of his exhausted
    Class and Deployment cards. Each hero readies all of
    his activation tokens, flipping them green side faceup.
**3. Deploy and Reinforce:** The Imperial player may spend
    **threat** to bring additional figures onto the map.
**4. End of Round Effects:** Resolve any abilities or mission
    rules triggered at the end of the round.
If playing with 3 heroes, a hero with 2 activation tokens
    must give 1 of them to another hero of his choice.
**5. Advance Round Dial:** Advance the round dial by 1.

```
Threat and Deployment
During the Status phase, the Imperial player increases
```
**threat** (^) which he can spend to deploy additional figures.
Each Deployment card has a **deployment cost** , a
**reinforcement cost** , and a **group limit**.
During each Status phase, the Imperial player may deploy
groups of figures and/or reinforce individual figures to
the map.
**To deploy a group** , choose a Deployment card in your‘
hand and spend equal to the card’s deployment cost.
Then place the card faceup on the table and place a
number of corresponding figures on the map equal to
the card’s group limit, as close as possible to a green
deployment point shown in the mission’s diagram
(including deployment point’s space).
**To reinforce** , choose a Deployment card already on the
table and spend equal to the card’s reinforcement
cost. Then place **1 figure** from that group as close as
possible to a green deployment point.
Red, blue, and yellow deployment points are not active
until specified by the mission.
Each time you spend , reduce the threat dial by that
amount. You cannot have less than 0 or more than 20.

## ENDING A MISSION

```
Each mission’s rules list the conditions that cause the
mission to end. As soon as an end condition is met, the
Imperial player resolves the End of Mission section of the
mission rules. Read the listed story text aloud then give
players the listed rewards.
```
```
Players then receive the rewards listed in the Additional
Rewards section.
```
## CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE

```
Players first resolve a mission, then have the opportunity
to purchase new Item cards, Class cards, and Agenda
cards. Then they choose and resolve a new mission.
They continue resolving these stages until the campaign
ends with a climatic mission called a finale.
To continue a campaign, check the campaign log on
the back of the Campaign Guide , and resolve the next
available (unmarked) stage. After resolving each stage,
mark the stage’s box on the campaign log to track your
progress.
```
```
Track experience points (XP), credits, and influence on
the campaign log with a pencil.
```
## 1. MISSION STAGE

```
a. Choose Mission: Rebel players refer to the campaign
log to find their next mission. If the entry reads Side
Mission , choose one of the active Side Mission cards.
If it reads Story Mission , choose an active Story
Mission card.
```
## CAMPAIGNS


**b. Resolve Mission**

**c. Post-Mission Cleanup:**

- Wounded heroes flip their Hero sheets to the
    healthy side. Heroes recover all and.
- Shuffle all Supply cards back into the deck.
- Heroes gain 50 credits for each crate token claimed
    during the mission, then discard the tokens.
- Return the just resolved Mission card to the box.
- If players just resolved the introductory mission,
    shuffle the Side Mission deck, then draw 2 cards
    and place them faceup. These are now active
    missions.

```
If players just resolved an active, non-agenda Side
Mission, shuffle the Side Mission deck and draw 1
card. This card is now an active mission.
```
## 2. REBEL UPGRADE STAGE

**a. Spend XP:** Each hero can spend XP to purchase any
number of cards from his Class deck.

**b. Spend Credits:** Rebel players draw 6 cards from
each Item deck listed on the campaign log and may
collectively decide which to purchase by spending
credits equal to the cards’ costs. Credits are shared
by the group. Each purchased card is given to a hero
to use in future missions. Unpurchased cards are
shuffled back into their deck.

Players can then sell Item cards they own for credits
equal to half the card’s cost (rounded up to the nearest
25). Item cards without a cost can be sold for 50
credits. Sold cards are returned to the box.

## 3. IMPERIAL UPGRADE STAGE

**a. Spend XP:** The Imperial player can spend XP to
purchase cards from his Class deck.

**b. Spend Influence:** The Imperial player draws 4 cards
from the Agenda deck and may purchase any of them
by spending influence. Unpurchased cards are shuffled
back into the deck without being revealed to the Rebel
players.

**Agenda Cards
Side Missions:** The Agenda card is placed faceup on the
table and becomes an active side mission. Heroes can
choose to resolve one of these missions anytime they can
resolve a side mission.

These cards provide an automatic reward to the Imperial
player if the heroes decide to resolve another side mission
instead of this Agenda’s mission.

**Forced Mission:** Players immediately resolve the listed
mission.

**Ongoing:** The Agenda card is placed in the Imperial
player’s play area, has an ongoing effect and remains in
play until discarded by another effect.

**Kept Secret:** The Imperial player keeps the card hidden
from the Rebel players (the only information they will
know about the card is its cost) and resolves it later as
instructed.

Unless instructed otherwise, Agenda cards are returned to
the box when discarded or completed.

**Spending Experience Points**
When you are allowed to spend experience, you may
look through your deck of unpurchased Class cards and
choose to purchase any of them by spending XP equal to
the card’s cost.

```
After purchasing a Class card, place it faceup in your
play area. You can use its abilities for the rest of the
campaign.
```
## WINNING THE CAMPAIGN

```
Players’ ultimate goal is to win the finale (the last mission
of the campaign).
```
```
Throughout the course of the campaign, players receive
rewards such as Item cards, Class cards, Agenda cards,
and allies that will help them win this finale. Certain
mission rewards also steer the direction of the narrative
and will dictate which of the finale missions players will
resolve.
The players who win the finale are the ultimate victors
and have won the campaign.
```
## CAMPAIGN RECORD KEEPING

```
After a game session:
```
```
Record Progress: Ensure the campaign log has up-to-date
information about all players’ XP, credits, and influence.
Mark the current stage of the campaign and list the
names of all completed missions.
```
```
Store Components: Store components in bags and keep
them separate between sessions.
```
```
The General bag stores all active Mission cards and any
Agenda cards that are in play.
```
```
The Imperial bag stores purchased Imperial Class cards
and the Imperial player’s deck of unpurchased Agenda
cards, plus any of the Imperial player’s secret Agenda
cards that have been purchased (keep these separate
from your Agenda deck).
```
```
Each hero creates his own Hero bag containing his Hero
sheet, Item cards, and purchased Class cards. One player
should store available allies in his bag, if any.
```
```
All other components do not need to be kept separate
and are can be returned to the box; this includes all Class
cards that players have not purchased, so that they are
not confused with previously acquired Class cards.
```
## ALLIES

```
Deployment cards with a bullet (•) before the figure’s
name are unique allies. Imperial allies are called villains
but follow the same rules as allies. Allies and villains
cannot be used in a mission until claimed as a reward or
granted by an effect.
```
```
Once gained as a reward, villains can be brought into any
mission as an open group.
```
```
On missions, allies function like additional figures on
that player’s side. Defeated allies are removed from the
map and cannot be redeployed for the remainder of the
mission.
```
```
Once Rebel players gain an ally as a reward, they
can bring that ally to any mission. Immediately after
deploying hero figures to the map during setup, Rebel
players can deploy up to 1 ally. Place all figures
corresponding to the ally’s Deployment card as close
to the Rebel entrance token as possible. The Imperial
player then gains threat equal to the Ally card’s
deployment cost and may immediately resolve an optional
deployment.
When it is their opportunity to resolve an activation,
Rebel players can choose to activate an ally, collectively
controlling it. Afterwards, exhaust its Deployment card,
and then the Imperial player performs an activation.
```
```
Rebel allies are not heroes; they cannot interact with
crates or rest, can perform only 1 attack each activation,
and follow all other rules for non-hero figures. The term
‘Rebel figures’ includes all heroes as well as Rebel allies.
```
```
If an ally has both a regular and elite Deployment card,
only the regular card can be used as an ally. If an ally
is rewarded to the heroes and the heroes have already
earned that ally, they can use either the elite or regular
Deployment card.
```
```
If a mission gives the heroes control of a specific ally
for that mission, the ally follows all normal rules for
allies but has special deployment rules and does not
give the Imperial player additional threat or an optional
deployment. They also do not restrict heroes from
deploying another ally.
```
## ATTACHMENTS

```
When the Imperial player deploys figures to the map
(even when deploying initial groups), he may take 1 or
more Attachment cards and places them on the figures’
corresponding Deployment cards. The abilities on the
cards apply to all figures in the group.
```
```
When the last figure in a group is defeated, return any
cards attached to the Deployment card to the Imperial
player’s play area. He may attach these cards when
deploying figures in the future.
Attachments may require the group to have a specific
trait, and cannot be played on a group that does not have
the trait.
```

## MISSION SETUP

## IMPERIAL PLAYER:

Assemble the map and place tokens.

Set the **threat dial** to 0 and the **round dial** to 1.

Sort the Deployment cards into groups:

```
Initial Groups: Faceup cards. Deploy the figures.
```
```
Reserved Groups: Secret facedown pile. Deploy the
figures when dictated by the mission.
```
```
Open Groups: Secret hand of cards. Figures can be
deployed during the Status phase. Choose any or
Deployment cards (unique cards and allies must be
earned as mission rewards).
```
```
Read the Mission Briefing section aloud.
```
## EACH REBEL PLAYER:

Chooses Item cards you will bring to the mission.

Places his hero figure on the entrance token or as close
as possible to it. Then, an earnt **ally** may be deployed.

Takes activation token(s), green side faceup.

## DURING CAMPAIGN MISSIONS

## CAMPAIGN STATUS PHASE

**1. Increase Threat** by the threat level (see campaign log).
**2. Ready:** The Imperial player readies his exhausted
    Class and Deployment cards. Each hero readies his
    activation tokens.
**3. Deploy and Reinforce:** The Imperial player may spend
    **threat** to bring on additional figures at green
    deployment points.
**4. End of Round Effects:** Resolve any abilities or mission
    rules triggered at the end of the round.

If playing with 3 heroes, a hero with 2 activation tokens
must give 1 of them to another hero of his choice.

**5. Advance Round Dial**

## CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE

## 1. MISSION STAGE

**a. Choose Mission:** If the next campaign log entry reads
_Side Mission_ , choose one of the active Side Mission
cards. If it reads _Story Mission_ , choose an active Story
Mission card.

```
b. Resolve Mission
```
```
c. Post-Mission Cleanup:
```
- Wounded heroes flip their Hero sheets to healthy.
    Heroes recover all and.
- Shuffle Supply cards back into the deck.
- Heroes gain 50 credits for each crate token claimed
    during the mission, then discard the tokens.
- Return the just resolved Mission card to the box.
- If players just resolved the introductory mission,
    shuffle the Side Mission deck, then draw 2 cards
    and place them faceup as active missions.

```
If players just resolved an active, non-agenda Side
Mission, shuffle the Side Mission deck and draw 1
card as an active mission.
```
## 2. REBEL UPGRADE STAGE

```
a. Spend XP: Each hero can spend XP to purchase any
number of cards from his Class deck.
b. Spend Credits: Draw 6 cards from each Item deck
listed on the campaign log and collectively decide
which to purchase. Credits are shared by the group.
Unpurchased cards are shuffled back into their deck.
```
```
Players can then sell Item cards (return them to the
box) for half their cost (rounded up to the nearest 25).
Item cards without a cost can be sold for 50 credits.
```
## 3. IMPERIAL UPGRADE STAGE

```
a. Spend XP: The Imperial player can spend XP to
purchase cards from his Class deck.
b. Spend Influence: Draw 4 cards from the Agenda deck
and purchase any of them by spending influence.
Unpurchased cards are shuffled back into the deck
without being revealed to the Rebel players.
```
```
Agenda Cards
Side Missions: Place faceup on the table as an active
side mission. Heroes can choose to resolve one of these
anytime they can resolve a side mission. The Imperial
player receives a reward if the heroes decide to resolve
another side mission instead of this Agenda’s mission.
```
```
Forced Mission: Players immediately resolve the mission.
```
```
Ongoing: Place in the Imperial player’s play area. Ongoing
effect; remains in play until discarded by another effect.
```
```
Kept Secret: The Imperial player keeps the card hidden
from the Rebel players and resolves it later as instructed.
```
```
Unless noted, Agenda cards are returned to the box when
discarded or completed.
```
## QUICK CAMPAIGN SUMMARY


## SETUP

**1. Bring Armies and Command Cards:** Each player needs
    an army of up to 40 points worth of **Deployment cards**
    and a deck of exactly 15 **Command cards**.

Each player places his Deployment cards faceup in
front of him and shuffles his deck of Command cards.

**2. Determine Initiative:** The player who has the lowest
    total cost of Deployment cards chooses which player
    begins the game with the initiative token. On a tie,
    players determine initiative randomly.

The player with initiative will choose deployment zones
and resolve the first activation during the first round.

**3. Determine and set up Skirmish Mission:** The player
    with initiative shuffles his Skirmish Mission deck and
    draws 1 card (your Skirmish deck consists of 1 copy
    of each Skirmish Mission card you own; you cannot
    customize the cards in your Skirmish deck).

This lists the mission’s name, special rules, and which
map it is played on. Refer to the matching skirmish
mission diagram to build the map. Place only the A or
B tokens that match the Skirmish Mission card’s letter.

**4. Deploy Units:** The player with initiative chooses the
    red or blue **deployment zone** on the skirmish mission’s
    diagram, and deploys all of his figures in this zone.
    Then his opponent deploys all of his figures in the
    other deployment zone.

If you cannot fit all of your figures into your deployment
zone, fill as many spaces as possible (you may redeploy
previous placed figures), then deploy your remaining
figures in the spaces closest to your deployment zone.

**5. Draw Command Cards:** Each player draws 3 cards from
    his Command deck.

## PLAYING A SKIRMISH

**1. Activation Phase:** First resolve any abilities triggered
    at the start of a round.

Then, starting with the player with initiative, players
take turns activating deployment groups and
performing actions with the corresponding figures.
Once all Deployment cards are exhausted, proceed to
the Status Phase.

If your opponent has more ready Deployment cards
than you, you may choose not to activate a group and
pass play to your opponent.

**2. Status Phase:** Players resolve the cleanup steps
    in preparation for the next round. These steps are
    different than the Status Phase steps in a campaign.

Repeat these phases until the mission ends.

## SKIRMISH STATUS PHASE

**1. Ready Cards:** Both players ready their Deployment
    cards.
       **2. Draw Command Cards:** Each player draws 1 Command
          card from his deck, plus 1 additional card for each
          terminal he controls.

```
You control a terminal if you are the only player who
has a figure on or adjacent to that terminal.
```
**3. End of Round Effects:** Resolve any abilities or mission
    rules triggered at the end of the round.
**4. Pass Initiative:** The player with the initiative token
    passes it to his opponent.

## COMMAND CARDS

```
You may play a Command card when specified on the
card. Reveal it to your opponent, resolve its ability, then
discard the card.
```
```
There is no limit to the number of Command cards you
can play each turn, or to the number of cards you may
have in hand, but you cannot play multiple copies of the
same Command card at the same time.
```
```
If there are no cards left in your Command deck, you
cannot draw Command cards.
```
```
Command cards with a restriction box listed above the
ability (using the word you to refer to the figure using the
ability) must be played on a single friendly figure that
matches the restrictions listed. If you do not have any
eligible figures on the map, you cannot play the card.
```
```
If the card has the icon, that figure must use one of
its actions to resolve the ability on the card.
```
```
Some Command cards have abilities that apply until a
specific time. To remember that the card is in effect, you
may place the card by the figure or Deployment card it
is affecting.
```
## CHANGES FROM THE CAMPAIGN

```
Strain: A figure that suffers suffers instead.
```
```
For each a figure suffers, the player controlling that
figure may choose to discard 1 Command card from the
top of his deck to prevent the figure from suffering the
resulting. Figures cannot recover in a skirmish.
```
```
Resting: Figures cannot rest.
```
```
Attacking: Figures can only use one of their actions to
attack per activation , including using special actions that
involve performing one or more attacks.
```
```
Heroes: Hero sheets are not used; instead, players use
the corresponding Deployment cards. Heroes do not
follow the hero rules from the campaign and instead
function like all other figures. Their activations are
tracked by exhausting their Deployment cards, they
can use 1 action to attack per activation, and they are
removed from the map when defeated.
```
```
No Supply Cards: Figures cannot interact with crate
tokens to draw Supply cards. The effects of crate tokens
are described in the mission’s rules.
```
## WINNING A SKIRMISH

```
The game ends as soon as one player has accumulated
40 VPs. The player with the most VPs wins the game.
```
```
Defeating Figures: When the last figure in a group is
defeated, the opposing player scores VPs equal to that
group’s deployment cost. The card’s controller places the
Deployment card near his opponent.
```
```
Card and Mission Effects: Each Skirmish Mission card,
and some Command or Deployment cards, list additional
ways in which players can gain VPs.
```
```
When you gain VPs, record the number of VPs ( eg on the
Threat dial) and keep it by the figures you have defeated.
If all of your figures are defeated, you lose the game
immediately, regardless of VPs.
```
## ARMY BUILDING

```
Each player builds an army consisting of Deployment
cards and Command cards. Build armies without
knowledge of the opponent’s army or the mission.
```
```
Any armies may play against one another, but figures
must be marked in some way so they are identified with
their player and group.
```
## CHOOSING DEPLOYMENT CARDS

```
Deployment cards in your army determine the figures you
bring to the skirmish, and must obey these restrictions:
```
```
Deployment Cost: The total Deployment cost of your
cards must be 40 or fewer deployment points (upper left
corner of the card).
```
```
Affiliation Restriction: All deployment cards in an army
must contain the same affiliation icon (upper right corner
of the card).
```
```
Name Restriction: Each army is limited to a number of
Deployment cards with the same name as follows:
```
- Maximum of 1 of each **unique** Deployment card
    (• before the name).
- Maximum of 2 of each **elite** (red) Deployment card.
- Maximum of 4 of each **regular** (gray) Deployment card.

```
Skirmish Upgrade Cards: Deployment cards with the
S kirmish Upgrade trait provide special abilities, but do
not have corresponding figures. These cost deployment
points and often have a game changing ability.
```
## CHOOSING COMMAND CARDS

```
Each player’s Command deck must obey these restrictions:
```
```
Deck Size: Each army’s Command deck must include
exactly 15 Command cards.
```
```
Command Cost: The total cost of a player’s Command
cards must be 15 or fewer points.
```
```
Duplicate Restriction: A Command card’s number of card
limit icons (to the right of the card’s cost) is the number
of copies of that card a player can have in his deck.
```
## SKIRMISH RULES


## DEPLOYMENT CARD RESTRICTIONS

A deployment card marked with a **campaign deployment
icon** can be used only in a campaign, while one with a

**skirmish deployment icon** (^) can be used only in a skirmish.

## TILE TYPES

Each map tile has one or more tile types corresponding to
the environment that tile represents.

The primary tile type distinction is between **interior** and
**exterior**.

**Forest:** Core Game 01A-18A, 37A, 38B, 39A; _Return
to Hoth_ 05A, 24A; _Bespin Gambit_ 11A; _Jabba’s Realm_
01A, 03A-06A, 08A-09A, 11A-12A, 14A, 16A; _Tyrants of
Lothal_ 02A, 09A -10A.

**Desert:** Core Game 01B-18B, 37A, 38A, 39B; _Twin
Shadows_ 04B-07B; _Bespin Gambit_ 12A; _Jabba’s Realm_
03B-04B, 06B, 08B, 14B, 16B; _Tyrants of Lothal_
01B-02B, 04B-07B, 09B-10B, 12B.

**Snow:** _Return to Hoth_ 01A-24A, 21B.

**City:** _Heart of the Empire_ s 01B-18B.

**Interior:** Core Game 19A-36A, 19B-36B, _Twin Shadows_
01A-07A, 01B-03B; _Return to Hoth_ 01B-20B, 22B-24B;
_Bespin Gambit_ 01A-10A, 01B-12B; _Jabba’s Realm_ 02A,
07A, 10A, 13A, 15A, 17A, 01B-02B, 05B, 07B, 09B-13B,
15B, 17B; _Heart of the Empire_ 01A-18A, _Tyrants of Lothal_
01A, 03A-08A, 11A-12A, 03B, 08B, 11B.

## DICE AND ICON TYPES

Blue, red, green, and yellow dice are **attack dice**.
Black and white dice are **defense dice**.

```
and are attack icons.
, , and are defense icons.
```
## FIGURE COST

If a deployment group has a starting group size of 1, that
figure’s figure cost is equal to the group’s deployment cost.

If a deployment group has a starting group size of 2 or
more, each figure in that group has a figure cost equal to
the group’s reinforcement cost.

## HABITAT

**Habitat** is a keyword found on certain deployment cards.
During a campaign, an Imperial player selecting open
groups for a mission can choose a deployment card with
the Habitat keyword only if there is at least 1 tile in that
mission’s map whose type matches the listed habitat.

During a skirmish, Habitat has no effect.

## CLASS CARDS

Some heroes have a **class deck** that includes item cards
with an XP cost. These can be purchased with XP like any
other class card and are used like other items of the same
type. If you wish to sell any of these items after purchasing
them, you may do so for 50 credits like any other item
card without a listed credit cost.

## SKIRMISH ATTACHMENTS

Skirmish upgrade deployment cards with the word
_Attachment_ above their abilities can be attached to other
deployment cards.

```
When deploying units during skirmish setup, if you have
has 1 or more Attachment cards in your army, place each
of these cards on one of your non-upgrade deployment
cards. Each deployment card can have only 1 Attachment.
Abilities on Attachment cards apply to all figures in the
corresponding group.
```
```
Many attachments require the group to have a specific
trait. Attachments with these restrictions cannot be played
on a group that does not have the trait.
When a group with an Attachment card is defeated, the
opposing player scores VPs equal to the deployment cost
of the Attachment card, in addition to the VPs they score
from the defeated group’s deployment card.
```
## NEUTRAL DEPLOYMENT CARDS

```
Deployment cards with a neutral icon and card back do
not belong to an affiliation. When creating an army for a
skirmish, you may include neutral deployment cards as if
they belonged to your affiliation. Neutral deployment cards
cannot be used in a campaign.
```
## REBEL UPGRADE STAGE

```
When 1 or more expansions are part of a campaign, Rebel
players follow a different Rebel Upgrade Stage.
Instead of drawing 6 cards from each item deck listed in
the campaign log, make note of the total number of cards in
each item deck at the start of the campaign. Then, during
each Rebel Upgrade Stage, Rebel players draw a number
of cards from each of the appropriate item decks equal to
half that number (rounded up) for the respective deck.
```
## TWIN SHADOWS

## DEVICE TOKENS

```
The hero Saska Teft uses device tokens to grant
herself and the Rebels powerful abilities. These
only interact with abilities on her hero sheet and
class cards.
If Saska is chosen during campaign setup, place the
8 device tokens near her sheet. During a mission, her
abilities may allow friendly figures to claim and discard
these tokens. The number of device tokens that figures can
collectively claim is limited by the supply of 8 tokens.
```
## RETURN TO HOTH

## RECON TOKENS

```
The hero Loku Kanoloa uses recon tokens to
grant himself and the Rebels tactical
advantages. These only interact with abilities on
is hero sheet and class cards.
If Loku is chosen during campaign setup, place the 2
recon tokens near his sheet. During a mission, his abilities
allow him to place these tokens. The number of recon
tokens that can be placed is limited by the supply of 2
tokens. However, when he places a token, Loku may either
use a token already in play, or use one from his supply.
```
## THE BESPIN GAMBIT

## COMPANIONS

```
A companion is a new type of support figure associated
with a hero or a group. The companion shares that hero
or group’s affiliation and activates before or after the
corresponding activation.
When a companion is put into play, place its companion
card faceup in the ready position near its associated
deployment card or hero sheet. Then place its token on the
map as indicated by the effect putting it into play.
```
```
A companion does not block LOS, and a hostile figure does
not spend 1 additional MP to enter a space containing a
companion. A companion can end its movement in a space
containing another figure, and vice versa. A companion is
adjacent to each figure and object in its space, and vice
versa.
A companion cannot interact and cannot use abilities on
class, item, or supply cards. A companion automatically
fails attribute tests.
A companion has a figure cost of 0.
When a group that is associated with a companion leaves
play, the companion remains in play but can no longer
activate unless a game effect allows that companion to
activate as part of a different group.
During a campaign, only 1 companion of each type can be
in play at a time. During a skirmish, each player may have
1 companion of each type in play.
When a companion is put into play under a player’s
control, if that companion was already in play under that
player’s control, it is removed from the map first.
During a skirmish, abilities that specifically affect a
companion can affect only your companion.
```
## JABBA’S REALM

## BOUNTY TOKENS

```
The Hutt Mercenaries Imperial class uses bounty
tokens to place prices on the heroes’ heads,
inspiring Imperial figures to take them down.
These only interact with abilities found on their
Imperial class cards.
If Hutt Mercenaries is chosen as the Imperial class during
campaign setup, the Imperial player places the 4 bounty
tokens near his play area. At the start of the campaign,
each hero claims 1 bounty token. As the campaign
progresses, heroes claim and discard these tokens as
described on the Wanted: Dead Imperial class card.
Unlike other tokens, heroes do not discard bounty tokens
at the end of a mission during Post-Mission Cleanup.
```
```
The number of bounty tokens that can be used is equal to
the number of heroes in the campaign.
```
## REPLACING TILES

```
When the Imperial player must replace 1 or more tiles with
other tiles previously set aside, they remove the listed tile
or tiles from the map, then connects the listed set-aside
tiles to the newly exposed puzzle edge of the map.
If a figure or token is occupying a space on a removed tile,
place it in the corresponding space of the replacement tile.
If there is no such space, place it in the nearest possible
space instead.
```
## HEART OF THE EMPIRE

## POWER TOKENS

```
When a figure with a power token declares an
attack or is declared as the target of an attack,
that figure may discard 1 of its power tokens.
If it does, apply +1 of the symbol on that token to that
attack’s results.
When an ability instructs a figure to gain a specific power
token, that player claims 1 token of that type from the
supply and places it either near that figure on the board, or
on that figure’s deployment card or hero sheet if that figure
is the only figure in its group. When an ability instructs
a player to gain any number of , that player gains that
number of power tokens of his choice.
```

**Each figure cannot have more than 2 total power tokens**.
If a figure would gain more than 2, its player must choose
tokens to discard until the figure has 2.

**A figure cannot spend more than 1 power token per attack**.

## ENERGY SHIELDS AND RUBBLE

A space can contain both rubble and an energy shield.

```
A space containing rubble is considered to be
difficult terrain, in addition to its other terrain
types. The effect of rubble does not stack with
the effect of preexisting difficult terrain.
```
A space containing an **energy shield** blocks LOS,
but does not block movement, adjacency, or
counting spaces. The diagonal intersection of a
space containing an energy shield and either a
wall, blocking terrain, or another energy shield also blocks
LOS. LOS can be traced to a figure or object occupying a
space containing an energy shield.

## NEGATIVE DEPLOYMENT COST

When you include a card with a negative deployment cost, it
modifies the total deployment cost of the rest of the cards.

If a card with a negative deployment cost is an
attachment, the other deployment cards selected for the
army must include at least 1 eligible card onto which it
can be attached. When a group with an attachment with a
negative deployment cost is defeated, the VPs scored are
modified by that card’s negative cost.

## FORM CARDS

A form card adds its text box and abilities box to a
deployment card. When a form card is gained, place that
card, oriented horizontally, below the relevant deployment
card. All text on the form card is treated as though it were
text on that deployment card.

A deployment card can only gain a form card with a
subname corresponding to that deployment card’s name.

## TYRANTS OF LOTHAL

## STYLE TOKENS

```
The hero Tress Hacnua uses style tokens to
enhance her melee attacks. These only interact
with abilities on her hero sheet and class cards.
```
If Tress is chosen during campaign setup, place the 2 style
tokens near her sheet. During a mission, Tress’s abilities
allow her to gain and spend these tokens. The total
number of style tokens that can be gained is limited by the
supply of 2 tokens.

## ALLIES

During the _Tyrants of Lothal_ mini campaign, Rebel players
follow a different procedure when choosing to deploy an
ally in a mission.

**When setting up the campaign mission** , after the Rebel
players choose and deploy an ally, the Imperial player no
longer gains threat equal to the deployment cost listed on
the ally’s deployment card.

Instead, the Imperial player gains threat equal to half
that cost (rounded up) and may resolve an optional
deployment.Then, the Imperial player places **strain tokens**
equal to half of the ally’s deployment cost (rounded down)
in their play area.

**During step 1 of the Status phase** , after gaining threat
equal to the threat level, the Imperial player discards 1
strain token from their play area to increase threat by 2.
The Imperial player does this each round until there are no
strain tokens in their play area.

```
If the ally is defeated, the Imperial player discards any
remaining strain tokens in their play area. They do not gain
threat for tokens discarded this way.
```
## SPECTRE ALLIES

```
During the Tyrants of Lothal campaign, the Rebel players
will be prompted to bring a Spectre ally. Spectre allies are
those allies with Spectre or Chopper as part of its sub-
name, such as Kanan Jarrus, Spectre-.
During campaign setup, when the hero players are
choosing green side missions, they may choose more than
one mission that rewards Any 1 Spectre ally.
```
## AGENDA CARDS

```
During the Tyrants of Lothal mini campaign, the Imperial
player can only have a total of 4 agenda cards between
their hand and their play area. If, at the end of an Imperial
Upgrade stage, they have more than 4 agenda cards, they
must discard down to 4.
```
## TIME PERIOD

```
The side missions in Tyrants of Lothal do not include a
time period. These missions may be included when playing
a campaign in any time period.
```
## PAYING VPS

```
When an ability instructs a player to pay another player
VPs, the paying player loses VPs and the paid player gains
an equal number of VPs.
If using an ability requires a player to pay more VPs than
that player has, that player cannot use that ability. If a
player’s ability requires an opponent to pay more VPs than
they have, that opponent pays all of their remaining VPs.
```
## FOUR PLAYER SKIRMISHES

```
When setting up the skirmish mission , players do not
use their standard skirmish mission deck, but instead
use a deck that includes only skirmish mission cards
corresponding to 4 player skirmish maps.
Two additional deployment zones , yellow and green, are
available. When deploying units, the player with initiative
chooses one of the 4 available deployment zones and
deploys all of his figures in this deployment zone. The
player to his left does the same, choosing from the
remaining deployment zones, and so on until all players
have deployed.
During the Activation phase , each player in clockwise order
activates a group.
During the Skirmish Status phase , all players ready all
of their deployment cards and the player who has the
initiative token passes it to the player on his left.
There are 2 different modes of play for 4 player
skirmishes: Free-For-All and Team Battle.
Free-for-all
All other players are opponents, and all of their figures are
hostile figures. The skirmish ends immediately when at
least one player has gained 40+ VPs, at which point the
player with the most VPs wins the game. The game also
ends when 3 players have been eliminated, at which point
the remaining player wins the game.
Team bttle
The players on your immediate left and right are your
opponents and the remaining player is your teammate. All
figures belonging to opponents are hostile, and all figures
belonging to your teammate are friendly.
```
```
The skirmish ends immediately when one team has
collectively gained 60+ VPs, at which point the team with
the most VPs wins the game.
```
```
The game also ends when a pair of teammates have both
been eliminated, at which point the remaining team wins
the game.
Special rules
When a card effect targets your opponent, you must
choose 1 available opponent.
If a player would claim the initiative token out of turn, that
player receives the first activation on that turn, but does
not claim the initiative token.
After the first activation resolves, play passes to the player
with the initiative token and then proceeds normally.
```
```
The player with the initiative token cannot also use effects
that would claim the initiative token.
If multiple players use effects that would claim the
initiative token, each of those players gain an activation
that they may use before the player with initiative resolves
his first activation. These activations are resolved in order
of initiative.
A player cannot use more than 1 effect that would allow
him to claim the initiative token in the same round.
When the last figure in a group is defeated, the player who
defeated that figure gains the VPs for that figure’s group.
```
```
When the last figure in a group is defeated, but was not
defeated by an opponent, that figure’s player chooses 1
available opponent to gain the VPs for that group.
If all of a player’s figures are defeated, that player is
eliminated. He can no longer play cards, and his skirmish
upgrade cards no longer have any effect.
If more than one player includes the skirmish upgrade card
Devious Scheme in his army, then all copies of Devious
Scheme have no effect.
Conflicts
During a 4 player skirmish, mission rules are resolved first,
followed by effects from the player with initiative, and
then effects from each other player, proceeding clockwise
around the table.
Also, when playing a team battle skirmish, conflicts that
arise during an attack resolve slightly differently than in
other missions. Mission rules are resolved first, followed
by effects from the attacker and the attacker’s figures,
then effects from the defender and his figures. After both
the attacker’s and defender’s effects have resolved, the
attacker’s teammate may resolve effects, followed by the
defender’s teammate.
