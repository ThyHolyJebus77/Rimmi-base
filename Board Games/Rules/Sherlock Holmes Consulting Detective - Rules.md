### CONSULTING DETECTIVE

Welcome to the streets of London in the Victorian era. The fog is spreading, crime runs rampant, and you, one of
the Baker Street Irregulars, are here to lead the investigation... In A Study in Scarlet , Watson introduces the Baker
Street Secret Police Section to us for the first time.
This group “ of half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street urchins that I ever clapped eyes on ” , under the leadership of Wiggins,
was a most precious help to Sherlock Holmes, to whom they were “ the eyes and ears in the streets of London ”.
As early as 1888, in The Sign of Four , Wiggins had become a young man, and his group of Baker Street Irregulars had doubled.
“ They go everywhere, see everything , hear all that is said, ” declared Holmes. Wiggins had become a vital collaborator to the
world’s greatest consulting detective.
Holmes’ career in Baker Street lasted some 22 years. The number of cases he had to solve grew at the same speed as his
reputation. After Watson’s first marriage, in November 1886, Holmes relied increasingly on the help of the Baker Street
Irregulars. During the years in which Holmes was absent, from 1892 to 1894, it was Wiggins, who was then attempting to
become an actor, who kept Mycroft Holmes informed of the criminal underworld’s activities in London. Mycroft, who had
frequent contact with his brother, would pass this information on to Sherlock.
Wiggins continued to collaborate with Holmes throughout the 1890’s, and during the first few years of the following century.
His talents as an actor, which he had learned mostly from Holmes, helped him move easily through the various layers of
London society. Upon Wiggins’ death, in 1939, his journal, which spoke of the many cases on which he had worked with
Holmes, was found. You’ll find in this book excerpts from that journal.
```
##### INTRODUCTION

You take on the role of members of the unofficial gang of the “ Baker Street Irregulars ”, founded by the famous Sher-
lock Holmes to keep him informed about the word on the street and help him in mysterious cases. This book
contains ten mysterious cases which will be up to you to solve. Four of these cases (books 1 to 4) form the Jack the
Ripper campaign and may allow you to catch the famous serial killer. The other six cases are unconnected.
For each case, you’ll have a series of leads to follow, a map of London, a directory, and the local press.
You also have a list of informants which contain some very qualified people who will assist you in your research (medical
examiner, criminologist, sources...)
Armed with all these elements and with your imagination, you’ll walk the streets of London looking for clues which will
allow you to solve the enigma and answer a series of questions about the case. But nothing’s ever as simple as it seems, and
you will have to be wise if you don’t want to be ridiculed during your final confrontation with Holmes!
Will you surpass the master?
```
##### MAP OF LONDON

This map represents the Victorian city of London in a simplified way. During the game, the map will allow you to locate, for
example, a specific place or verify an alibi. For practical reasons, London is divided into 5 neighbourhoods (North West or
NW, West Centre or WC, South West or SW, East Centre or EC, and South East or SE) divided by blue lines and the Thames.
Each neighbourhood contains numbers which correspond to the addresses of people you will go and question. This division
is also used in the book’s chapters and in the directory. For example, the address of Hyde Park is 95 NW (abridged form, used
in the booklets or in the directory), or otherwise 95 Park Lane NW (long form including the street name, used in the news-
paper). On the map, the places marked in red represent specific areas (such as the British Museum), and the places marked in
black are police stations. Other places aren’t fixed and a given address can thus change ownership from one case to the next. In
addition, numbers indicate a housing block. Thus, the hotel Dacre is located at 62 EC, but it is possible that a character could
also have that address, but without living at the hotel.
In one of the corners of the map is a travel time duration scale. That scale will sometimes allow you to check the movements
of some suspects and thus verify their alibi. To simplify the game, we’ll consider their speed to be fixed, no matter which trans-
port method is used. Of course, the travel time of the players is never taken into account.

##### CONTENTS


##### MAP OF WHITECHAPEL

Located on the back of the map of London, this map shows the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, located in the east of London.
All of the addresses of Whitechapel correspond to the E (East) and EC (East Centre) neighbourhoods.

_Note: this map is only used for the Jack the Ripper campaign (books 1 to 4)._

##### LONDON DIRECTORY

```
This booklet presents the addresses of people living in London. Thus, when players wish to meet
someone, they can consult the directory to find their address and then head over to that address by
reading the corresponding lead. To simplify the game, the address system uses the map's division system.
Thus, for example, Sherlock Holmes’ address (which will be found in the directory under “ Holmes,
Sherlock ”) is 42 NW. If the players want to head over to Holmes’ during the case, they must therefore
read chapter 42 NW from the current case.
Note: found in the directory, in addition to the standard alphabetical list, are entries by profession.
```

##### LIST OF INFORMANTS

Located on the back of this book, this list offers Sherlock Holmes’ recurring informants, as well as their addresses. These
informants will be able to help you in most cases, some being more useful than others depending on events.

##### CASE BOOKS

These ten books contain the ten cases you will have to solve. The cases are sorted by date and are all structured the same way:

 **Introduction:** in this text the title and date of the mystery are presented to you, as well as the details of the case (generally
during an interview with Holmes).

 **Leads:** this part of the text represents all of the leads (in the form of chapters) which you may follow during your investigation.
By following the leads and making the proper deductions, you will be able to solve the mystery offered by Holmes. Each lead
corresponds to a geographic area (see Map of London and Directory). The leads are sorted by neighbourhood and, in each
neighbourhood, the leads are sorted in ascending order. The illustrations which accompany the text are purely decorative.


 **Questions:** as soon as you think you have solved the case, you will be faced with two series of questions. The first series is
always in direct relation to the case. The second series will allow you to score additional points for the discovery of events
which are related to the case.

 **Solution:** Holmes will detail for you the way he unravelled the threads of the case.

 **Score:** in this final section (located in the envelope placed at the end of the book), you’ll get the answers to the questions
and will tally your final score, which you’ll then compare to Holmes’.

##### NEWSPAPERS

For each case, you’ll have at your disposal the day’s newspaper, as well as all of the newspapers published on previous dates.
In these newspapers you’ll sometimes find articles or ads which will point you at new leads.


Books 1 through 4 form a campaign which allow players to try and catch the infamous Jack the Ripper. They must be played
in order.

If the players are discovering the world of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective with this boxed set, we suggest they do not
start with the campaign, but rather with the first of the stand-alone cases ( _Doctor Goldfire)_ to familiarise themselves with the
game system.

The newspapers related to the Jack the Ripper campaign are completely independent from those of the other cases. By playing
cases 5 to 10, the players will therefore have no need of the newspapers from the Jack the Ripper campaign (dated 1888).
Thus, if the players play the first independent case ( _Doctor Goldfire_ ), they only take a single newspaper (September 13th 1898).

The Jack the Ripper campaign hinges on the four murder nights. It is impossible to stop Jack before the end of the fourth case.
However, during the first three cases, the players will see themselves given specific tasks which will allow them to answer
questions and progress in the case.

The Jack the Ripper campaign is based as much as possible on known facts and actual testimonies. It will thus be slightly
different from a traditional Sherlock Holmes case, as it will be less romanticised. The descriptions and the facts may harm the
sensibilities of younger players, we therefore suggest you do not play this campaign with children.

##### THE JACK THE RIPPER CAMPAIGN


 The players choose a case they all agree on. For practical reasons, we suggest that the cases are played in chronological order
(Notably in order to avoid finding clues in the newspapers which may spoil the surprise, and in so doing, the fun).

 The map of London is placed in the middle of the table.

 The London Directory and the list of informants (at the back of this book) are placed near the map.

 The players also place nearby the newspaper whose date matches the case’s, as well as all previous newspapers.
_Important: newspapers with a date following that of the case will not be used._

 The players may choose to grab blank sheets of paper and pencils to keep notes during the investigation.
_Note: the players may delegate the task of keeping notes to a specific member of the group._

 A player is chosen as the _“lead investigator”_. That player takes the book, reads the case’s introduction text, and the game begins!

##### GAME SETUP

The players all cooperate to solve the case.
The game plays over a series of turns.

The lead investigator chooses a lead from the current case (they can for example declare “ _I want to go visit the crime scene,_ ” find
the address in the directory and go there).
If the lead doesn’t exist in the book (meaning there’s no corresponding paragraph in the current case for the location the
player wanted to visit), the player simply chooses another lead.
When they have found their lead, the player reads the paragraph out loud, then notes that this lead has been followed.
Their turn is now over.
_Note: to keep intact the pleasure of discovering the answer, avoid looking too closely at the other leads on the page you’re reading!_

They then pass the book to the player sitting on their left, who becomes the new lead investigator and chooses in turn a lead
of their own.
The players continue this way, until they believe they know the solution to the enigma.
The players can follow as many leads as they want, but on their turn a player can only read a single lead.

**Newspapers, already visited leads, directory:** on their turn, all of the players have a free and unlimited access to the
directory as well as the case’s newspapers. They can also reread the leads already visited as much as they want.

**Discussions:** of course, the players can talk between themselves as much as they want to talk about the case or to debate the
next lead to follow. But if there’s a disagreement between them about the next destination, it’s the current lead investigator
who has the final word.

##### SCORE
The players can decide to stop following leads as soon as they want to. They then move on to the _“Questions”_ section
of the case and answer the two series of questions given to them.

Players then head over to the _“Solutions”_ section and one of them reads Holmes’ conclusions out loud.

Finally, the players open the envelope to evaluate their score and compare it to Holmes’.

To tally their scores, the players add the points obtained by answering the questions, then total up the number
of leads they followed. Then, they compare this number of leads to the number of leads followed by Holmes.

_Note: in some cases, some leads are considered to be “free”. These are given at the end of the “Solutions” section of each
case. If the players have followed some of these leads, they do not count them among their followed leads._

If the players have followed more leads than Holmes, they subtract 5 points from their score for each extra lead.
If they’ve followed fewer leads than Holmes, they add 5 points to their score for each fewer lead. They obtain
their final score this way.

**Example:** the players have followed 8 leads and scored 95 points by answering the two series of questions.
They realise that Holmes has, for his part, finished the case with 6 leads. As they followed 2 extra leads, they
deduct 10 points from their score and finally only score 85 points.

##### holmes

The players may then compare their score to Holmes’. Holmes’ score is always 100 points. Defeating the Master
is clearly hard, but not totally impossible!

##### END OF THE GAME

```
##### INFORMANTS
Informants are recurring characters, with specific skills whose help you’ll sometimes need to progress in your
investigation. Of course, not all informants will be of use in each case, and they’ll sometimes even be missing. It’s up
to you to decide when to use a lead and call on one of them...
