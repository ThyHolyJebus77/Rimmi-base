## Comparisons to Civilization 5/6
- Unlike Civ games, this is a cooperative card game rather than a competitive strategy game
- Both feature different characters/civilizations with unique abilities
- Resource management is present in both, but simplified to card play in this game
- This game is much shorter and more focused on a single narrative arc

## Quick Start Rules Guide

### Goal
Work together to defeat enemies and destroy the One Ring before it corrupts you!

### Setup
1. Give each player:
   - 1 Hero character card
   - 1 Hero starting card
   - 6 Courage cards
   - 3 Despair cards
2. Shuffle the main deck (all other cards)
3. Place 5 cards face-up from the main deck to form "The Path"
4. Each player shuffles their cards and draws 5 to start

### On Your Turn
1. Play cards from your hand
2. Use "Power" on your cards to buy new cards from The Path
3. Attack enemies if you can
4. At end of turn:
   - Discard all played and unplayed cards
   - Draw 5 new cards
   - Refill empty spots on The Path

### Key Points
- Buy cards to make your deck stronger
- Defend against enemy attacks with Defense cards
- Corruption cards are bad - try to avoid them!
- Work together to defeat the final boss, Lurtz

### Game End
- Win by defeating Lurtz
- Lose if you can't refill The Path

*Remember, it's a team effort! Discuss strategies and help each other out.*

### Special Cards

1. **Ambush**: When revealed on The Path, affects the next player immediately. Use Defense to avoid if possible.

2. **Fortune**: Free to take and use right away. Replace it on The Path.

3. **Location**: Buy these, but when you play them later, they stay in front of you.

### Enemies

- The Archenemy deck contains powerful foes you'll face.
- The top card is always face-up. Defeat it to reveal the next one.
- Lurtz is at the bottom - defeating him wins the game!

### Tips for Success

1. Balance your deck: Don't just buy powerful cards, make sure you have a mix of abilities.

2. Communicate: Share what cards you have and discuss strategy with your team.

3. Manage Corruption: Try to avoid or remove Corruption cards when possible.

4. Use special abilities: Each Hero has unique powers - use them wisely!

5. Plan ahead: Look at the cards on The Path and think about future turns.

### Scoring (if you want to track improvement)

At the end of the game:
- Add up Victory Points (VP) on your cards
- Subtract 1 VP for each Corruption card
- Highest score wins (if there's a tie)

Remember, the main goal is to work together and have fun! Don't worry too much about perfect strategy in your first few games.

## Additional Notes
The game features a scaling difficulty system with an "Impossible Mode" for experienced players. The Corruption mechanic adds an interesting risk-reward element to player decisions throughout the game.
