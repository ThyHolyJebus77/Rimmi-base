     End move on space containing another player
     Space not portal or **_city_**
     Not end of round or game end final turn
     **_Rampaging_** enemy not provoked
**2. Defender** can use effects used before turn or on
    another player’s turn. **Choose** :
     **Full combat** :
        Flip round token down ( **can’t be attacked** while
          down). **Skip next turn** and flip over token
        May **use mana die** from source and **skills**
        After may play special/healing cards/effects
        Follow usual **end of turn** steps
     **Partial combat** :
        **Can’t use die** from source or **skills** normally
          available on turn
        After combat **turn immediately ends
3. Ranged and Seige**
    a. **Starting with defender** alternate ranged/ siege
       attacks until both pass in succession
    b. Play **Ranged/Siege Attacks** (attacker can play **only**
       siege if blocker is defender at **_fortified site_** )
    c. Blocker plays **blocks** using rules for inefficient
       attacks (block efficient if efficient against at least
       one element in attack)
    d. **Reduce by 1 per 2 block** (if “blocked enemy loses
       swiftness” is played then block works if full)
    **e. Attacker chooses how to assign remaining**
       **damage**
        **Unit** : wound and assign damage equal to armor
        **Hero** : wound and assign damage equal to armor
          any number of times
        May leave attack points unassigned
**4. Melee Attack**
    a. Similar to Ranged/ Siege except:
        **Aggressor starts**
        Play any combination/type of attacks
        Play cards sideways as physical attack 1
        The **block works in full**
    b. Two other ways to spend damage:
        Spend 5 damage to **steal one artifact** from
          discard pile, play area, or wounded unit
        Spend damage as movement points equal to
          unmodified move cost to force **blocker to**
          **retreat** to adjacent accessible safe space
**5. Outcome**
    a. If **forced retreat** , combat ends, victorious gets:
        If lower level, gain 1 Fame + 2 per level lower
        If same level, gain 1 Fame
        If higher level, gain nothing
    b. If both pass, then **ends in a draw**. **Aggressor**
       **withdraws** to attacking space
**6. Special Effects**
    a. Effects that target enemies **target unwounded**
       **units** but not hero
        Red abilities **no effect against fire resistance**
        Blue abilities **no effect against ice resistance**

```
 Effects that destroy enemy wound unit instead
 Armor cannot be reduced below 1
 Effects that affect blocked enemy may target
units contributing to attack instead. A successful
block is block that reduces attack to zero
 Number of enemies is equal to number of ready
unwounded units contributing to current attack
or block + 1
b. Effects that modify value/rule last entire combat
c. Effects that prevent enemy from attacking
remove contributing unit from attack instead
(unit remains unspent)
d. Effects that skip block and damage can cancel one
attack (cards remain played, units spent) and
combat continues

    participants **assault city**
     Each starts by moving directly to city. Add provoked
       or challenged **_rampaging_** enemies
     Each **may use 1 die from source** (return after
       assault) and effects used before or during turn
     Each performs all combat phases before the next
