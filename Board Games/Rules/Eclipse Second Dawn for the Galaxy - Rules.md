## Comparisons to Civilization 5/6

- *Exploration:* Both games feature exploration as a core mechanic, but Eclipse focuses on space exploration with modular hex tiles, while Civilization explores a terrestrial map.
- *Technology:* Both games have technology trees, but Eclipse's system is more focused on immediate benefits and ship upgrades. Civilization's tech tree is broader, affecting multiple aspects of gameplay and cultural development over a longer period.
- *Combat:* Eclipse emphasizes space combat with customizable ships, using dice rolls for resolution. Civilization has a mix of land, sea, and air units with a more deterministic combat system.
- *Resource Management:* Eclipse has a streamlined resource system with just three types (Money, Science, Materials), while Civilization manages multiple resources like food, production, gold, and strategic resources.
- *Diplomacy:* Civilization has a more complex diplomacy system with various interactions between civilizations. Eclipse's diplomacy is simpler, primarily focused on non-aggression pacts and victory points.
- *Game Length:* Eclipse is designed for a single session (2-4 hours), while Civilization games often span multiple sessions or take much longer to complete.
- *Victory Conditions:* Eclipse focuses on points from various sources (controlled sectors, technologies, battles). Civilization offers multiple distinct victory types (Science, Culture, Domination, etc.).
- *Scale:* Civilization spans the entire history of human development, while Eclipse is set in a futuristic space-faring era.
- *Player Interaction:* Eclipse encourages more direct player conflict through space battles and area control. Civilization allows for more varied interactions, including trade, cultural influence, and espionage.
- *Randomness:* Eclipse incorporates more randomness through dice rolls and tile draws, while Civilization tends to be more deterministic in its outcomes.

# Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy - Rules

[[Eclipse Second Dawn for the Galaxy.pdf]]

SETUP

1)   Draw tech tiles = 2x # of players, +8. Doubles count toward this limit, but rare (black) tiles don’t 2)   Only some of the sector III hexes are included in the supply: 2p=5, 3p=8, 4p=14, 5p=16, 6p=18
3)   Choose species in reverse player order
4)   Leave 3 inHluence discs in tray (5 for the Eridani), and put the remainder out on inHluence track
5)   On your starting hex, place…
·	1 in9luence disc (from the left side of your inHluence track) and 1 interceptor (Orions get 1 cruiser) ·	2 population cubes on the basic (non-starred) planets (Hydrans get 1 on advanced labs)

SPECIES DETAILS

Eridani Empire:
·	Starting money is very high, but have -2 inHluence discs
·	Start with 3 techs, and 2 randomly drawn reputation tiles (keep both) ·	Ships have +1 energy
Hydran Progress:
·	Starting science is high and start with Advanced Labs tech ·	Can perform 2 research actions per turn
Planta:
·	Have 4 colony ships, but population cubes are automatically destroyed after they lose a battle (as though opponents were using neutron bombs tech)
·	Performs 2 explore actions per turn (and can chain them), gains +1 point for each controlled sector ·	All ships have -1 slot for upgrades, but…
o  Start with Starbase tech, starbases have +1 computers and +5 energy o  Ships have +1 computers and +2 energy
Descendants of Draco:
·	On explore action, draw 2 tiles and choose 1 ·	Is friendly with ancients, and thus…
o  Can share hexes with them and colonize said tiles o  Never obtains discovery tiles from ancients’ hexes
o  +1 point for all surviving ancients at end of game ·	Starts with Fusion Drive tech (extra movement)
Mechanema:
·	All building costs are -1 (monoliths are -2)
·	Has 3 build and 3 upgrade activations per turn
·	Starts with Positron Computer tech (+1 computers)
Orion Hegemony:
·	Starts with a cruiser instead of an interceptor, and all ships have increased initiative/energy and are pre-upgraded with basic tech components
·	Starts with Neutron Bombs and Gauss Shield techs ·	Poor trade ratio of 4:1

GAME CONCEPTS

Ambassador tiles are only used in games with 4-6 players.
·	2 players with adjacent controlled sectors (wormhole generators and warp portals don’t count) may agree to form a diplomatic relationship and exchange ambassador tiles (+1VP)
o  This is a free action and can occur during either player’s turn
o  Each player chooses a population cube (of any type) to send along with the ambassador tile (this is the only time colony ships are NOT needed to move population)
·	Cannot occur if:
o  The players already have each other’s ambassadors (from a previous turn/round) o  One of the player’s has ships in the other’s sector (i.e. battle is coming)
o  Either of the players currently holds the traitor tile ·	Attacking a player will break existing diplomatic relations
o  Each player takes back their ambassador and places its population cube onto any track
o  The attacker takes the traitor tile (-2VP), which they will hold onto until another player breaks one of their own diplomatic relations
Colony Ships are the only way to put Population Cubes onto the board.  Using them is a passive action and can happen any time during the action phase, and again at the beginning of the upkeep phase (prior to calculating income).  Any population type can be added/removed from a grey planet, but only money/science cubes can be added/removed from an orbital structure.  The only ways to remove population are:
·	Near the end of the combat phase, if your attacker successfully attacks your population (or uses neutron bombs to immediately remove all of your population)
o  Attackers get to roll all of their attacking dice at once, killing one of your population for each successful hit (the attacker can split up hit points from a single die)
o  A loss of all your population in this way also results in a loss of your inHluence disc from the sector (return it to your inHluence track)
o  Population lost this way will temporarily be placed in the “graveyard” bowls at the centre of the corresponding income track; only after income is calculated will they return to the income tracks
·	At the beginning of the upkeep phase, to avoid bankruptcy
o  If you cannot or do not wish to trade resources for money, you can return inHluence discs to your inHluence track to avoid bankruptcy; once the inHluence disc is removed, the population cubes must go too (cannot be present if you do not control the sector)
o  Population lost this way will go directly back on the income tracks (i.e. doesn’t enter graveyard)
“Control” means you have an in9luence disc on the sector.  Simply having ships present in a sector does not connote control (though you can use unpinned ships as a starting point for explore actions, even if you do not control that hex with an inHluence disc).
Reactions (upgrade, build, move) can be taken after you’ve passed, usually in response to enemy aggression. Any techs or species abilities pertaining to extra activations do not apply to reactions.
“Ships” refers to all 3 ships and also to starbases (thus starbases do pin enemy ships). “Structures” refers to orbitals and monoliths.
Warp portals are an optional games module.  They consist of a sector II hex, two sector III hexes, a discovery tile, and a rare tech (when you research this tech, immediately place the circular warp portal tile on a sector you control (which is now worth +1VP).

ACTION CLARIFICATIONS

Explore: You can either place the tile or discard it face up (Descendants of Draco always discard at least 1 tile face up).  Exploring can be done next to any sector you control (with an inHluence disc) or have an unpinned ship.  There has to be a wormhole-half heading in that direction, unless you have the wormhole generator tech.  If you get >1 activation with your explore activation (Planta), your 2nd explore activation can leap frog off of the Hirst tile you placed.
Move: Each movement activation can be used to move only one ship.  You can only move through complete wormholes or warp portals, unless you have the wormhole generator tech (in which case you still need to move through wormhole-halves.  You can’t move if you’re pinned (each enemy / opponent / NPC ship, including starbases, pins one of your ships).  The GCDS pins all ships.
InFluence: The whole in9luence action resets 2 of your colony ships, ready for use.  Each in9luence activation allows you to pick up an in9luence disc from a sector you control or from your inHluence track.  You can then place it in one of 3 places:
1.	An uncontrolled sector next a sector where you control or have a ship (even if it’s pinned, unlike explore actions)
2.	An uncontrolled sector where only you have a ship 3.	Your inHluence track (right-most space)

COMBAT

Engagement Rounds: Battles are fought in descending (highest-to-lowest) sector order.  If there are more than 2 players in the hex, start with the last player to arrive as the attacker.  The Hirst player / NPC to have presence (including an inHluence disc) will always be the Hinal defender.  Any ship types with missiles will Hire them once, in initiative order (with defenders breaking ties).  Then for each round of regular combat, each group of the players’ ships will either Hire or initiate retreat in initiative order (with defenders breaking ties).
Attack or Retreat: If retreat is initiated, they don’t Hire but are still vulnerable until they’re activated again next round (when they complete their retreat to an adjacent sector).  If they Hire, each die they roll is assigned to a single enemy ship (no dice-splitting).  Each hit taken must be absorbed by hull, otherwise the ship is destroyed; i.e. ships are destroyed by hits = hull value + 1.  Damage taken by NPCs is always applied to your ships from largest to smallest, unless a single NPC attack can immediately destroy one of your smaller ships.
End of Sector Battles (i.e. in one sector): The winner of a given battle carries over damage if there are more battles to be fought in the same sector.  In the rare case of a stalemate (e.g. because all ships only have missiles), the attacker must retreat (or destroy their ships if there are no longer any free areas for retreat). After all battles are done in a given sector, players draw reputation tiles in order of entry into the sector.  If you had retreated from the battle, do not draw a reputation tile for participation (though you may draw tiles for any ships you destroyed prior to retreating).
End of All Battles (i.e. for all sectors): For each sector (again descending highest-to-lowest), the winner Hires once more all non-missile weapons from all surviving ships.  Any hits are applied to enemy population cubes, and dice-splitting is allowed.  If you have neutron bombs (and the enemy doesn’t have neutron absorbers) or you are targeting the Planta, all enemy population is automatically destroyed.  Destroyed population cubes are returned to the enemy’s graveyard, where they will stay until after income is calculated (i.e. income isn’t lowered for this round).  If all of the enemy’s cubes were removed from a sector, their inHluence disc also returns to their inHluence track.  You may now place one of your own inHluence discs there.  (You may also place inHluence discs anywhere you have a ship).  Take any discover tiles present (e.g. if you just eliminated an NPC), and remove all damage from surviving ships.

DISCOVERY TILES

You collect discovery tiles as you explore, and there is no need to place an inHluence disc Hirst (a change from the 1st edition).  All tiles must be used immediately for their effect, or else saved for 2VP.  Ancient ship parts must be placed into one blueprint only.  Ships and structures are placed where the discovery tile was uncovered.


Ancient Tech: Take the regular Tech Tile with
the lowest printed cost that you don't already own.



Ancient Warp Portal: Place in the Sector where found, which now connects to all other warp portals and is worth +2VP if controlled.


UPKEEP & CLEANUP

1)   Use any colony ships left over from the action turns, to add population to any newly acquired sectors.
2)   Calculate money income, trading materials/science or removing presence from sectors if you need to avoid bankruptcy.  If you cannot avoid bankruptcy, you’re eliminated from the game.
3)   Calculate materials/science income.
4)   Return inHluence discs to the inHluence track
5)   Move all population cubes from graveyards to their respective tracks. 6)   Refresh your colony ships.
7)   Draw tech tiles = # of players + 3. 8)   Advance the round marker.


1. Choose an Unexplored space next to at least 1 Sector Hex Tile, where you have an Influence Disc or an Unpinned Ship, to Explore from.
2. Reveal 1 Sector Hex from the corresponding I, II, or III stack and
choose to either Place or Discard the Hex face up.

Each Research Action allows you to purchase 1 available Tech Tile. (Hydran Progress may purchase 2 Tech Tiles per Research Action).
The large number on the bottom-left of a Tech Tile is its cost in Science	.
The smaller number is its minimum cost. Gain discount for the purchase,






1.   Place the Round Marker in the ‘1’ slot of the Tech Tray. 2.   Put the Tech Tiles in the white Bag. Draw a number of
regular Tiles (	) according to the number of players. Place these Tiles in the Tech Tray with matching Tech and Cost icons, stacking duplicates.
Rare (     ) Tech Tiles are placed in the bottom of the tray, these do not count towards the number of regular Tiles to draw (there is no limit to the number of Rare Tech Tiles that can be made available in the game).

3.   Put the Reputation Tiles in the black bag. Shufle the Discovery Tiles, and Sector Hexes (by type) into face-down stacks. Use the number of Outer Sector III Hexes according to the number of players.
4.   Choose 1 Blueprint Tile for each of the 3 types.
5.   Set the Galactic Centre Sector Hex in the middle of the table. Place the GCDS Miniature and a facedown Discovery Tile on it.
6.   Randomly assign the Start Player Tile.	GCDS 7.   If playing with Minor Species, place 4 random Minor Species
Ambassador Tiles in the play area.
8.   Beginning with the player to the right of the Start player and moving counter-clockwise, choose whether to play as Terrans or an Alien Species. Each Alien player takes their Species Board and matching Species Tray. The remaining Terran players then take 1
Species Board and matching Species Tray in any remaining colours. 9.   Each player places their starting Sector Hex, on the side
corresponding to either the Terrans or the Alien Species, in the Starting Zone closest to them. Then fill each empty Starting Zone with a random Guardian Sector Hex, with a facedown Discovery Tile and Guardian Miniature on it.
Place each starting Sector Hex with their arrow facing the GCDS. 10.Gain the number of Colony Ships indicated on your Species Board. 11.Place your Summary Tile, Action Phase Overview side-up.
12.Fill your Influence Track with your Influence Discs; you will have 3 leftover.
13.Fill your Population Track spaces labelled from 3-28 with your Population Cubes.
14.Place your 3 Storage Markers on the Starting Storage Resource values indicated on your Species Board.
15.Move 1 Interceptor Miniature, the leftmost Influence Disc from your Influence Track, and 1 leftmost Population Cube to each Population Square without a star (an “Advanced” Square	) on your Starting Sector. (Hydran Progress start with Advance Labs so they place 1 Population Cube on their Advanced Science Population Square on their starting Sector Hex).



Eclipse is played over 8 Rounds, each consisting of the following 3 Phases.



In turn order: each player’s turn consists of 1 of the following 6 Actions,
or a Pass Action.


If you discard, your Action immediately ends.

Sector Hexes in Areas I and II are laid in circles around the Galactic Centre Sector. Sector Hexes in Area III may branch outwards.
The Sector Hex must be placed so that at least 1 of its Wormholes connects with 1 of the Sector Hexes from which you are Exploring. (If you have the Wormhole Generator Tech, you may place the Sector Hex with only half a Wormhole connecting to the Sector Hex you Explored from. The half Wormhole can be in either Sector Hex).
If the placed Sector Hex Tile contains a Discovery symbol, place a facedown Discovery Tile on it. If it depicts Ancient symbols, put that number of Ancients on top of the Discovery Tile.
3. If the Discovery Tile is undefended, collect it, then either use it for its Bonus, or gain it facedown for 2 VP. You may then take Control of the undefended Sector Hex by placing your leftmost Influence Disc on
it from your Influence Track.


Discovery Tile	1 Ancient Symbol	Symbol





Each Upgrade Action grants you the number of Upgrade Activations indicated on your Species Board. With each Upgrade Activation you may, in the following order:
1. Return any number of Ship Part Tiles from your Blueprints to the Upgrade Tray (removing an Ancient Ship Part discards it from the game).
2. Move any 1 Ship Part Tile from the Upgrade Tray to any empty or preprinted Ship Part Space on a Ship Blueprint on your Species Board.
XAfter completing all Upgrade Activations check each Ship’s Energy Consumption does not exceed its total Energy Production	.

•   When you Upgrade a Ship’s Blueprint, all Ships of that type are instantly Upgraded. All values from Ship Parts are cumulative.
•   Some Ships have extra Ship Parts outside the Ship Part Grid; these work like other Ship Parts only they cannot be replaced.
•   Some Ship Parts require that you’ve first Researched the requisite Tech. •   Interceptors, Cruisers, and Dreadnoughts must have at least 1 Drive
Ship Part Tile.
•   Drive Ship Part Tiles cannot be used on Starbase Blueprints	.



Each Build Action grants you the number of Build Activations indicated on your Species Board. With each Build Activation you may Build 1 Ship or Structure on any Sector Hex you Control with 1 of your Influence Discs.

•   Orbitals, Monoliths, and Starbases first require you to have Researched the required Tech before they can be built.
•   Each Sector Hex may have at most 1 Monolith and 1 Orbital.
You may however, own multiple Starbases on a single Sector Hex.

equal to the leftmost revealed number on the Tech Track the Tile is placed on. Pay the Tile’s Science	cost, and place it on the leftmost empty space of your corresponding Military, Grid, or Nano Track.
•   Rare (     ) Tech Tiles may be placed on a Tech Track of your choice. •   Each of your 3 Tech Tracks may hold a max. of 7 Tech Tiles.
•   You may not cover any starting printed Techs.

With each Influence Activation you may either:
XMove 1 Influence Disc from your Influence Track, or a Sector Hex you Control to an uncontrolled Sector Hex where either:
(a) Only you have a Ship, or
(b) no opponent Ships (including Ancients) are present and a full Wormhole (if you have the Wormhole Generator Tech; a half or full Wormhole) or a Warp Portal Connection exists with a Sector Hex
where you have a Ship or Control.
or
XMove 1 Influence Disc from a Sector Hex you Control to the rightmost empty space of your Influence Track. You must also return all Population Cubes back to their respective Population Tracks.
•   If you move a Disc from one Sector Hex to another, also return the Population Cubes from that Sector Hex to their Population Tracks.
•   Population Cubes removed from Gray Population Squares

Population Cubes from your Control Board to any empty, matching coloured Population Square or Orbital on a Sector Hex you Control.
• In the Action Phase, you may move to a Sector Hex currently containing opponent Ships.
• Orbitals may hold either 1 Science or 1 Money Population Cube.
• Gray Population Squares may receive a Population Cube from any colour Population Track.
• Population Squares with a star are “Advanced”.	You must first Research the related Advanced Tech before you can place Population Cubes on these Squares. Gray Advanced Population Squares can be placed upon with ANY Advanced Population Tech, or Metasynthesis.

TRADE
At any time, and as many times as you choose/are able to, you may pay your Trade Value in a single Resource to gain
another 1 Resource of your choice.



In order to determine Initiative Order for each Ship type belonging to each player, add up the total number of Chevrons	on each Ship type involved in the Combat. Ties are broken in favour of the Defender.
Ships are then activated in Initiative Order.

If a player has multiple Ship types with the same number of Chevrons, they play them in an order of their choice. This same order must then be followed for each subsequent Engagement Round in this Battle.
FIRE MISSILES
At the start of a Battle, all Ships with Missiles are fired once in Initiative order. Simultaneously roll 1 die of the corresponding colour for every Missile Die symbol on that Ship’s Blueprints.
Then a series of Engagement Rounds follow until only Ship(s) belonging to 1 Player/NPC remain on the Sector Hex. As follows:


Each Ship Type is activated in Initiative Order.
When Activated, choose to either Fire the Ship’s Cannons or Retreat.
If any Ships began their Retreat on the previous Engagement Round, they may now move to the Sector Hex they are Retreating to.
FIRE CANNONS
Simultaneously roll 1 die of the corresponding colour for every Cannon Die symbol on the Ship’s Blueprints.
RETREAT
Move ALL Ships of that type to a full Wormhole Connection on the edge of the Sector Hex. It must neighbour another Sector Hex that you Control
where no opponent Ships are present (If you have the Wormhole Generator Tech, you may Retreat over a half Wormhole).
These Ships complete their Retreat at the start of their next turn. Retreating Ships do not Attack but may be Attacked.

Once all Ships have been activated, if more than 1 player/NPC’s Ships remain on the Sector Hex, begin another Engagement Round.
Once dice are rolled, each die is assigned to a single opponent Ship. Multiple dice may be assigned to the same opponent Ship.
Each Burst (	) is always a Hit, blank faces are always a Miss.

If a number is rolled, add the value of that Ship’s Computers	and subtract the value of the target’s Shields	.
If this Hit Value is greater than, or equal to 6, the Attack Hits.

If the number of Hits is greater than the target Ship’s Hull (the total value of	on its Blueprint) then the Ship is destroyed. Remove the Ship from the Sector Hex and place it next to your Species Board. Otherwise mark damage by placing 1 Damage Cube per Hit next to the miniature.
If Battling NPC opponents, another player rolls the dice. If possible, dice
are assigned so that your Ships are destroyed/Hit from largest to smallest.

X+1 for participating in the Battle. If all your remaining Ships attempted to Retreat, do not draw a Reputation Tile for participating.
X+1 for each opponent Interceptor, Starbase, or Ancient destroyed. X+2 for each opponent Cruiser, or Guardian destroyed.
X+3 for each opponent Dreadnought destroyed. X+3 for destroying the GCDS.
2. Return all destroyed Ships back to the players’ supplies.


Perform each step for ALL Sectors before moving onto the next step.
1. Each Ship may attack opponent Population Cubes on their current Sector Hex (including those on Orbitals), once with its non-Missile Weapons using normal rules to Hit. Each Hit destroys 1 Population Cube of the Attacker’s choosing. (If you have the Neutron Bombs Tech, all Population Cubes on the Sector Hex may be destroyed automatically.)
2. All destroyed Population Cubes are placed in the respective Population Cube Graveyard in the centre of that Population Track.
3. If you have at least 1 Ship in an opponent Controlled Sector (including Sector Hexes where no Battle took place) that has no Population Cubes (including those on Orbitals), return the Controlling player’s Influence Disc to their Influence Track.
4. If you have at least 1 Ship on a Sector Hex with a Discovery Tile, claim it. 5. You may then move Influence Discs from your Influence Track to Sector

If a Stalemate arises, the Attacker must Retreat or their Ships are destroyed.
Battles are resolved in descending numerical Sector Hex order, on each
Hex occupied by more than one Party (Player Ships/Influence Discs, or NPCs).

The Player who entered the Sector Hex last is the Attacker. If a player has
an Influence Disc on the Sector Hex, they are always considered the	1. Each player who participated in the Battle draws up to a max. of 5 Defender and will fight last regardless of the entry order.

4+ Players only
Diplomatic Relations can be formed with other players at any time during an Action on your turn.
If you have an Influence Disc connected through a full Wormhole (Wormhole Generator does not have effect here) to a Sector Hex where another player has an Influence Disc, you may both agree to give each other an Ambassador Tile with 1 Population Cube, from any 1 of your Population Tracks. These Ambassador Tiles are placed on empty spaces on each player’s Reputation Track.
• Players may not propose Diplomatic Relations if either player’s Ships are present on a Sector Hex Controlled by, or containing a Ship from the other player.
• You may only have at most 1 Ambassador Tile from each player.
• A player may not propose Diplomatic Relations if they either hold the Traitor Tile, or have no space on their Reputation Track. (You may discard any number of Reputation Tiles back to the bag to make room).
• You may form Diplomatic Relations after Combat and its aftermath are resolved, right before the Upkeep Phase.
Only an Act Of Aggression can remove an opponent’s Ambassador Tile from your Reputation Track. An Act Of Aggression is defined as having any number of your Ships on a Sector Hex where another player has a Ship or Control at the end of your Action.
When Diplomatic Relations are broken, each affected player returns the other player’s Ambassador Tile and Population Cube to a Population Track of their choice. The player initiating the Act Of Aggression receives the
Traitor Tile from the previous holder.

The Discovery Tile on the Black Hole Sector Hex cannot be taken when 1st Explored. INSTEAD, the 1st player to enter the Black Hole Sector Hex can gain it.
When you Move a Ship to the Black Hole, its Move Activation ends, and it leaves the Game Board. Roll 1 yellow die to determine when the Ship returns:
The Ship returns immediately with 1 Damage Cube. (This Hit is repaired at the end of the Combat Phase).
The Ship returns after 1 Round.
The Ship returns after 2 Rounds.

Where you return a Ship from a Black Hole to depends on the icon on the Sector Hex Tile:
Return to any	Return to any Sector Hex Inner (I)	that has at least 1 Wormhole Sector Hex.	adjacent to an empty space.

Pulsar Sector Hexes contain 3 Action Spaces that are used in place of a normal Influence Space. When you 1st gain Control of a Pulsar Sector, place your Influence Disc on its Move Action Space.

Each Pulsar Sector may never contain more than 1 Influence Disc.

Each Pulsar Sector you Control may be activated once per Round in place of taking a normal Action.

TO ACTIVATE:

Move the Influence Disc in the Pulsar Sector to either of other the 2 empty Action Spaces. You then execute 1 Activation corresponding to that Action Space.

You are not allowed to activate a Pulsar Sector after you have PASSED.

At the beginning of the Cleanup Phase, roll 2 yellow dice for each Explored Supernova Sector. Add the value of each Supernova Sector’s yellow dice (ignoring blank and burst	symbols) to the largest number of Techs the player Controlling that Supernova Sector has, on any of their Tech Tracks.

If the sum of the die values and Techs is less than the number of the current Round, the Supernova explodes -remove all Ships, Structures, Population Cubes, and the Influence Disc, then flip the Sector Hex over.

The removed Population Cubes are returned to their respective Population Tracks, and the removed Influence Disc is returned to its Influence Track.

Exploded Supernova Sectors have no Wormhole Connections, and may only be Moved to and from with the Wormhole Generator Tech using normal Movement rules.


Nebula Sectors have no Influence Space (and may never contain Influence Discs) and are divided into 3 Subsectors connected by Wormhole Connections. When you Explore and place a Nebula Sector Hex, place 1 Discovery Tile in each Subsector with a Discovery Tile Symbol, and 1 Ancient in the Subsector with the Ancient Symbol.

Discovery Tiles in Nebula Sectors can only be claimed by having a Ship in the Subsectors where the Discovery Tile is located at the end of the Combat Phase.

Discovery Tile benefits must be placed in the Subsector where they are found (the Ancient Orbital and Ancient Monolith cannot be placed in Nebula Sectors; if they are revealed in a Nebula Sector, draw a new Discovery Tile before choosing whether to keep it for its benefit or for VP).

For Move, Explore, and Influence Actions, each Subsector functions exactly like a normal Sector Hex.

AL
 
 
Q: Where can | get more Resources?
A: Place Influence Discs on Sectors, and use Colony Ships
to move your Population Cubes to Population Squares.
Research the Advanced Techs to move your Population Cubes
to Advanced Population Squares. Build Orbitals to get more
Population Squares. Collect Discovery Tiles.
Q: What do I need Moneyfor?
A: You need Moneyto Pay your Civilization Upkeep Cost. The
more Actions you take and Sectors you Control, the more you
have to Pay each Round.
Q: That's all?
A: You can also Trade Moneyfor other Resources,
and vice versa.
Q: | don't have enoughInfluence Discs to do everything |
wantto. What now?
A: You can usetheInfluence Action to return up to two
Influence Discs from your Sectors to your Influence Track.
You can also Research the ADVANCED rdsOTICS and QUANTUM Grid
Techs, which give you moreInfluence Discs. Finally, you can
deliberately use more Influence Discs than you can Pay for in
the UpkeepPhase, and thus be required to return some of
the Influence Discs from your Sectors to your Influence Track.
Q:Thebest Techsareterribly expensive. How can | ever
afford them?
A: Having Techs of the same category increases the discount
you get when buying more. If you buy the Techs in increasing
price order, you get the maximum benefit of the discounts.
Q: Whatis the benefit of being the Start Player?
A: Besides receiving 2 Money you also get the first pick of
Techs for Research or Zonesfor Exploring.
Q: What happensif the extra Influence Discs acquired
through the ADVANCED ROBOTICS and QUANTUM Grid Techs do not
fit on myInfluence Track?
A: Stack the extra Influence Discs on top of the Influence Disc
on theleftmost spaceof your Influence Track. You may use
these extra Influence Discs normally.
Q:Using the Influence Action, | can movean Influence
Disc from oneSectorto a neighboring Sector through a
Wormhole Connection. May | movethe Influence Disc from
the Sector that provides the Wormhole Connection?
A: No. As soon as you removethe Influence Disc from the
Sector providing the Wormhole Connection you no longer
meetthe Influence Action requirements.
Q: During the Upkeep Phase, when may| removeInfluence
Discs from mySectors?
A: Only when you do not have enough Money(Producedin
this Upkeep Phase, plus your Storage) to Pay your Civilization
Upkeep Cost. Then you may removeInfluenceDiscsuntil
your Civilization Upkeep Costis low enough. Notethat if you
removeanInfluence Disc from a Sector, the Population Cubes
in that Sector are immediately returned to your Population
Tracks, which may also reduce your MoneyProduction.
Q;: Is it ever possible to voluntarily remove Population Cubes
from the game board without Abandoningthe Sector?
A: No. It can be achieved with the Influence Action by first
removingthe Influence Disc and the Population Cubes from the
Sector and then returning the Influence Disc back to the Sectorin
a separate Influence Action.
Q: Myprecious Ships keep getting blownto pieces. How can |
win morebattles?
A: You have an advantageif you get to shootfirst, cannot be Hit,
or can take some beating. Upgrade your Drives to increase your
Initiative, and use Missiles to Attack before close-range combat.
UpgradeShields to render opponent's Computers useless.
Upgrade Hull parts to withstand moreHits. Collect Discovery
Tiles to get unique, powerful Ship Parts.
Q:Aren't Interceptors too small to be of any use?
A: Not really, but they do usually work best when specialized
somehow.For example, try Upgrading them with a better Energy
Source and they can pack quite a punch. Also, Interceptors are
great for Pinning larger Ships, forcing opponents to spend more
Actions to use them in importantbattles.
Q: Are Shields of any use if my opponents don't have
Computers?
A: No. Then again,if they don't have Computers, they mostlikely
won't Hit you anyway. Use that to your advantage.
Q: If | have the GLUON COMPUTER Tech, can | take POSITRON
COMPUTER Ship Parts?
A: No. Each Ship Part (apart from the default ones,i.e. 10N CANNON,
NUCLEAR DRIVE, NUCLEAR SOURCE, HULL and ELECTRON COMPUTER) requires
its own Tech.
Q:If all of my Shipstry to Retreat but are destroyed while doing
so, do | get the Reputation Tile for participation in a battle?
A: No. YourShips incur the Retreat penalty as soon as they
attemptto Retreat, regardless of whether they are able to
finish Retreating.
Q:If the Ancients are destroyed from a Descendants-Controlled
Sector but the Descendantsstill Control the Sector, can they
take the Discovery Tile?
A: Yes, they take the Discovery Tile at the end of the
Combat Phase.
Q;: If the Discovery Tile | get from ANCIENT LA3S allows meto place
somethingin a Sector (such as ANCIENT CRUISER or ANCIENT ORBITAL),
where do! place it?
A: You placeit in your Starting Sector. If you do not Control your
Starting Sector, you musttake the tile as 2VP.
Q: Do | haveto use the Descendants'or Planta's Explore ability?
If not, when may| choose whether to useit or not?
A: You don't have to draw twoSectors with the Descendants,
or Explore twice with Planta. You can decide after seeing the
first Sector.
Q: Can I Move throughaSector containing an opponent's Ships
using Cloaking Device without causing an Act of Aggression?
A: Yes.
Q: In whatorderdoplayers Influence Sectors at the end of the
CombatPhase?
A: For situations where the orderofInfluencing Sectors at the
end of the CombatPhaseis important, each Sectoris resolved in
descending Sector order.

Playing against the AI – BASICS
This document, when used with the 7 custom-made AI cards, makes it possible to play the game of “Eclipse – Second Dawn for the Galaxy” alone against an automated AI “player”
When the AI makes decisions based on game conditions, there may be two types of instructions that You should be aware of when looking for the unambiguous outcome:
“Restrictions” (red font), which MUST be true for the AI to proceed
“Priority list” (purple font), which gives You priorities in descending order of importance that You should follow, narrowing down possible outcomes until only one remains
A standard 6-sided die is needed for randomization
Whenever the AI has a decision to make, and the outcome of the decision cannot be unambiguously determined with the help of these rules, use the die to choose the outcome randomly from all the possible outcomes that best fulfill the instructions defined for the AI
The AI disregards many basic rules of the game, but if a rule is not explicitly bypassed or altered by these rules, the AI must follow the rule the same way as a human player would



Playing against the AI – SETUP
Set the game up as a normal 2 player game Do NOT use the Warp Portals -module Give the Start Player tile to the AI
Give the AI a Species tray, but do NOT give it a Species board (keep Influence discs in the tray) You should play as Terrans (the AI has not been designed / tested against Alien species)
These rules use cardinal directions when referring to relative positions of the different Zones: South = towards You, when looking from the Center Sector	North = away from You
Place Your Starting Sector into the southmost Starting Zone
Place the AI Starting Sector (with the Terran side up) into the northmost Starting Zone
The AI does NOT keep track of its resources, but it DOES use Population cubes normally NOTE: The AI Storage markers are used for other purposes, so keep them available
The AI does NOT use Colony Ships – it will place its Population cubes without Colony Ships NOTE: When these rules use the term “Population squares”, it includes Orbitals
The AI has its own Ship blueprints printed on the other side of this rule sheet: Place a “Nuclear Drive” -Ship Part into the blue “DRIVE”-slot
Place a Damage cube into each of the three green-bordered “Mk. 1”-slots
The blueprints with Damage cubes in them represent the currently active Ship blueprints
NOTE: All Ship types always have the same Drive, represented by the tile in the “DRIVE”-slot (remember to add the Initiative bonus from this tile to all of the blueprints)
