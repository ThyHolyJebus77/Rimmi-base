## Factions/Civilizations
Players can choose from different characters with unique abilities:

- Survivor: Starts with more knowledge, skilled at escaping
- Lab Rat: Expertise in analyzing objects and gaining knowledge
- Xenobiologist: Better at understanding and combating intruders
- Psychologist: Can manipulate other characters' actions
- Sentry: Combat specialist with unique weapons
- Cleaner: Skilled at repairing and managing facility systems

Each character has different starting equipment, special abilities, and action cards that influence their playstyle.

# Additional Notes

1. Power Management: The facility is divided into sections, each with its own power source. Managing power is crucial for using certain room actions and avoiding darkness penalties.

2. Intruder System: Alien encounters are managed through an intruder bag and token system, creating tension and unpredictability.

3. Contamination: Characters can become infected, adding contamination cards to their decks which may turn into a full-blown infestation if not addressed.

4. Multiple Endings: The game can end in various ways, including facility self-destruction, evacuation, or isolation room survival.

5. CSS (Cargo Sending System): Players can attempt to escape using CSS pods at specific times during the game.

6. Knowledge and Weakness: Characters can gain knowledge to unlock certain actions and discover intruder weaknesses through research.

7. Contingency System: Secret facility protocols that can drastically change the game state when revealed.

8. Alternative Board Side: Includes outdoor Mars terrain with special movement and survival rules.

9. Solo and Cooperative Modes: In addition to the semi-cooperative base game, there are fully cooperative and solo variants with adjusted objectives and mechanics.

10. Compatibility: While a standalone game, Nemesis: Lockdown can incorporate elements from the original Nemesis game for increased variety.

# Nemesis Lockdown - Rules

[[Nemesis Lockdown.pdf]]

#### SETUP

Use the basic side of the board (red arrows icon). Place these room
tiles on their slots: isolation room (the side without a room action
faceup), repository, and backup power supply.

Place the elevator, main gate, and rover on their places on and off
the board.

Shuffle all room tiles II, randomly place 1 tile facedown on each of
the II room slots, then return the remaining II tiles to the box. In the
same way, place all I room tiles on the room slots.

Shuffle the underground exploration tokens facedown, and place 1
facedown on each unrevealed room tile. Return the rest to the box.

Shuffle and randomly place power tokens (3 in the sections slots
and 1 on the elevator token). Place tokens numbered 1 and 2 blue
side up (which means the corresponding section is powered), and
tokens numbered 3 and 4 red side up.

Shuffle the CSS tokens facedown, and place 1 token facedown on
each CSS slot on the time track. Return the last token to the box.

Place the night stalkers laboratory board next to the board and
place 5 egg tokens in the nest slot, and 3 random night stalker
weakness cards facedown at the board’s bottom edge. Reveal the
leftmost card. Return the remaining weakness cards to the box.

Place these intruder tokens in the intruder bag: 1 blank, 4 larvae,
1 creeper, 3 adults, and 1 queen. Then add 1 additional adult
intruder token for each player. Place the rest of the intruder tokens
next to the board along with the intruder carcass tokens.

Shuffle and place these decks facedown next to the board with
space for a faceup discard pile next to each: 3 items (each
with its own color), night stalker event, night stalker attack,
contamination, and serious wound.

Shuffle the computer action deck and place it facedown on its
board slot, then reveal the top card. If Lock-down is revealed, reveal
the next and shuffle Lock-down back into the deck.

Place the crafted item deck next to the 3 item decks, and the
scanner next to the contamination deck.

```
Place the time token, red/inactive side up, on the
15th/green space of the time track.
```
Place the rest of the markers, tokens and dice next to the board.

Take as many help (use the lowest numbers, up to the number of
players), contingency, and night stalker reference cards as there
are players and randomly deal 1 to each player. Return the rest
to the box. The number shown on your help card is your player
number. Each player takes the plastic inventory card holder with
their number to keep their item cards hidden during the game.

Remove all cards showing a number of players higher than the
number playing the game from both objective decks (corporate
and personal). Shuffle the decks separately and deal each player 1
facedown card from each, then return the rest to the box.

Shuffle the contingency tokens and deal 1 to each player (for 2
players, deal 2 tokens each). Place 1 facedown token on the active
contingency slot. Keep tokens hidden from other players. Place the
rest in the slot next to the alert room to form the neutral pool.

Shuffle the character draft cards. Player 1 takes 2 random
character draft cards, reveals them, chooses 1 and shuffles the
other back into the character draft deck. Then player 2 chooses
their character the same way, then player 3, etc.

A player may only control the character whose card they have
chosen. After the draft, return the remaining character draft cards
to the box.

```
Each player takes their chosen character’s character board
and places their character’s miniature (in a colored ring) in the
appropriate room. Nemesis survivors (survivor, lab rat, and all
characters from Nemesis and the Aftermath expansion) start in the
isolation room. Facility workers (all other characters) start in the
repository room. Return the rest of the character boards to the box.
Take your character’s action card deck, shuffle it, and place it
facedown to the left of your character board. Place your character’s
starting item card, if available, in one of the 2 hand slots on your
character board (except xenobiologist). Place a number of ammo
markers equal to that item’s ammo capacity on the item card.
Place your character’s quest item, horizontal side up and inactive,
next to your character board.
Place your knowledge token, inactive/empty flask side up, on the
laboratory board: on slot 1 if you are a facility worker, and on slot 3
otherwise. Player 1 takes the first player token.
```
#### GAME SEQUENCE

#### I: PLAYER PHASE

## 1: DRAW ACTION CARDS

```
All players draw cards from their action deck until they have a
hand of 5 cards. If your deck is empty, first shuffle the cards in your
discard pile to form a new action deck.
```
## 2: FIRST PLAYER TOKEN

```
On every turn except the first, the player with the first player token
passes it to the player on their left. If players need to do anything in
order, start with the player with the first player token and continue
in clockwise order.
```
## 3: PLAYER TURNS

```
Starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player
performs a turn of 2 actions. Continue performing turns in order
until all players have passed, then go to the event phase.
```
```
When you pass, you may discard any number of cards from your
hand. Then flip your help card to the Pass side. If you cannot or
choose not to perform any actions you must pass. If you perform
only 1 action instead of the required 2 you must pass. Once you
pass you cannot perform any actions later that same turn and
round. Passing counts as taking an action in the player turn.
A character who finishes a turn in a room with a fire marker suffers
1 light wound. This happens even if they pass, but once they pass
they do not suffer any more wounds from fire this round.
```
#### II: EVENT PHASE

## 1: LAUNCH CSS

```
If there is a CSS token under the time token, reveal it and check
which CSS pods are launched this round.
```
## 2: TIME TRACK

```
Move the time token on the time track 1 slot to the right. Check if
you have to resolve the autodestruction sequence/alert procedure.
On power thresholds, check if the power has to be reduced.
```
## 3: NOISE REMOVAL

```
In sections with power, remove all noise markers in the corridors
not connected to rooms with characters. Do not remove noise
markers from the technical corridors space.
```
## 4: INTRUDER ATTACKS

```
Each intruder in the same room as a character performs an attack.
```
## 5: INTRUDER FIRE DAMAGE

```
Each intruder in the same room as a fire marker suffers 1 injury.
```
## 6: RESOLVE EVENT CARD

```
Draw and resolve 1 event card. If the event deck runs out of cards,
shuffle the discard pile to form a new event deck.
```
1. Intruder movement: All intruders with the intruder symbol shown
    (and not in a room with any characters) move to a neighboring
    room through the corridor indicated by the number shown.
    If there are 2 numbers, move the intruder types through the
    corridor with the first number, then through the corridor with
    the second number (if the intruder enters a room occupied by a
    character, do not move it further).
If the number indicates a technical corridor, remove the
    intruder miniature from the board and put its corresponding
    intruder token in the intruder bag.
If the number indicates a corridor with a door, the intruder
    does not move and the door is destroyed.
2. Event effect: Resolve the effect on the card. Some cards have
    additional effects only resolved in sections without power.

## 7: INTRUDER BAG DEVELOPMENT

```
Draw 1 intruder token from the intruder bag:
```
```
Larva: Remove this token from the intruder bag
and add 1 adult token to the bag.
Creeper: Remove this token from the intruder bag
and add 1 breeder token to the bag.
Adult: All players, in order, perform a noise roll.
If your character is in combat with an intruder, you do
not perform a noise roll. Return the token to the bag.
```
```
Breeder: All players, in order, perform a noise roll.
If your character is in combat with an intruder, you do
not perform a noise roll. Return the token to the bag.
```
```
Queen: If there are any characters in the nest, place the
queen there and resolve an encounter. Otherwise, or if the
nest is undiscovered, place an additional egg token on the
laboratory board. Return the queen token to the bag.
```
```
Blank: Add 1 adult token to the intruder bag (nothing
happens if there are none available). Return the blank
token to the bag.
```
#### CRITICAL MOMENTS

```
FIRST INTRUDER ENCOUNTER: When the first intruder miniature of
any type (not eggs) appears on the board, each player immediately
chooses 1 of their objective cards to remove from the game
facedown. The encounter is then resolved.
```
```
FIRST DEAD CHARACTER: The first time any character dies, the
facility immediately opens the main gate. Remove its token.
```
```
ISOLATION ROOM: When the time token reaches a white (##8) slot
on the time track, the isolation room becomes usable. Characters
cannot lock themselves there before this happens.
AUTODESTRUCTION SEQUENCE: If any character performs the
cooling system room action, place the autodestruction token 3
slots forward on the time track, yellow side up. While it is yellow side
up, players can turn off the sequence in the power generator room.
During the event phase of the round marked by the yellow
autodestruction token, just after moving the time token, move the
token another 3 slots forward and flip it to the red side. When the
time token is on a slot with the yellow autodestruction token and
has to move further, the main gate opens (remove its token) and
characters can no longer stop the autodestruction sequence.
```
```
During the event phase of the round marked by the red
autodestruction token, the facility is destroyed and all
characters and intruders in the facility die.
```
#### ACTIONS

```
The number in an action symbol is the cost to perform that action.
Discard that exact number of any action cards from your hand
faceup to your discard pile. The cost must be paid even if the action
is interrupted by another player, and if a one use only item action is
cancelled, discard the item.
```
```
Contamination cards are not action cards and cannot be discarded
to pay any action cost.
```
```
In combat only: A character may only perform this action
in combat (if there is an non-egg intruder in their room).
```
```
Out of combat only: A character may only perform this
action when they are not in combat.
```
## BASIC ACTIONS

```
Each character has the same set of basic actions.
```
#### REGARDLESS OF COMBAT

```
MOVEMENT: Move to a neighboring room directly connected
by a corridor (closed doors block movement). When
performing a movement in combat, you must escape instead.
```
#### OUT OF COMBAT

```
CAREFUL MOVEMENT: Move as normal, but instead of
performing a noise roll after moving, place a noise marker in
a chosen corridor connected to the room you are entering. If there
is a noise marker in all the corridors connected to the room, or you
are in combat, you cannot perform this action.
```
```
PICK UP HEAVY OBJECT: Pick up 1 heavy object (character
corpse, intruder carcass, or egg) in the room you are in. You
don’t need to use this action if you search and find heavy items.
```
```
TRADE: Start a trade with all characters in the same room.
Players may reveal and exchange any item cards and objects
they want to trade. Even though several players may take part in
the trade (with or without the active player), the only player that
performs the action is the one that started it. You may choose to
give an item card or object without asking anything in return.
Characters cannot exchange ammo.
```
```
CRAFT ITEM: Discard 2 item cards showing blue component
symbols to gain a crafted item with the same gray symbols.
```
#### IN COMBAT

```
SHOOT: Attack an intruder with an energy/classic weapon in
your hand, discarding an ammo marker from that weapon’s
card. You can only shoot intruders in the same room. You may also
shoot uncarried eggs outside of combat.
```
```
MELEE ATTACK: Attack an intruder in the same room
with bare hands or an improvised weapon.
```
```
ACTIONS FROM ACTION CARDS: You have a set of 10 action cards
you may perform. Discard the card from your hand faceup and pay
its cost (in addition to the action card with the performed action). If
an action card contains 2 sections separated by [OR], choose the
one you want to perform.
ACTIONS FROM ITEM CARDS AND ROOM TILES.
```
```
COMPUTER ACTIONS: Each character in a section with power and
in a room with a computer may use a computer action to perform
one of the 3 actions on the revealed computer card. Afterwards,
place the card on the bottom of the deck and reveal the next one.
Whenever a Lock-down card is revealed, immediately resolve it.
```
#### MOVEMENT & EXPLORATION

```
Characters and intruders may be placed and perform actions only
in rooms (CSS pods and the bunker are the exceptions). They may
never stop in corridors; the effects of moving through a corridor are
resolved after moving into the room. Characters may not access
technical corridors entrances or the technical corridors space,
except with the use of certain cards.
The facility is divided into 3 sections, each with its own power
source. The elevator power token is a separate fourth section.
After entering a room:
```
1. If the room tile was unexplored (facedown), turn it faceup.
    Then reveal and resolve the exploration token on that room tile.
2. If the room is empty (explored or unexplored, but no other
    characters or intruders), perform a noise roll.


## EXPLORATION TOKENS

#### 1. SET UP NUMBER OF ITEMS IN A ROOM

After revealing an exploration token, rotate the room tile until the
number on the token faces the item counter symbol on the board
next to the room tile slot: this is the number of items that can be
obtained from the room. Do not set this number in the nest room.

#### 2. RESOLVE SPECIAL EFFECT

After resolving an exploration token, remove it from the game.

```
SILENCE: Nothing happens. Do not perform a noise roll
for this movement. If this token was revealed due to a
careful movement, you still place a noise marker.
If you have a slime marker on your character board,
resolve DANGER instead.
```
```
DANGER: Do not perform a noise roll for this movement.
If there is an intruder in a neighboring room that is not in
combat with any character, move it to this room. If there
is more than 1 eligible intruder, move them all. If there
are no intruders in any of the neighboring rooms (or if
they are in combat), place a noise marker in each
corridor connected to the room without a noise marker
in it (including technical corridors).
```
```
SLIME: Place a status marker in the indicated slot of your
character board: you have been covered with slime.
```
```
FIRE: Place a fire marker in the room. A character who
finishes a turn in a room with a fire marker suffers 1 light
wound. This happens even if they pass, but once they pass
they do not suffer any more wounds from fire this round.
```
```
MALFUNCTION: Place a malfunction marker in the room.
```
```
DOORS: Place a door token in the corridor through which
you entered the room. Door tokens can never be placed
in technical corridors.
```
## NOISE ROLL

To resolve a noise roll, roll a noise die:

1, 2, 3 OR 4: Place a noise marker in a corridor with the matching
number that is connected to the room you entered (including
technical corridors).

```
SILENCE: See above under resolve special effect.
```
```
DANGER: See above under resolve special effect.
```
#### NOISE MARKERS

A corridor may never have more than 1 noise marker. If you have
to place a noise marker in a corridor that already contains one,
resolve an encounter instead.

If a marker must be placed and the number leads to a technical
corridor entrance, place it on the technical corridors space.

## INTRUDER MOVEMENT

If an intruder ends its movement in an unexplored room, do not
reveal the room or its exploration token.

If an intruder moves to a technical corridors entrance, it disappears
in the ducts: discard all its injury markers, return its token to the
intruder bag, and remove its miniature from the board. If there was
a noise marker on the technical corridors space, do not remove it.

When an intruder tries to move through a corridor with a closed door
token, it does not move, but destroys the door instead. If several are
moving from the same room, their movement is simultaneous: they
destroy the door and all stay in the starting room.

If you must place an adult intruder and all 8 models are already on
the board, they retreat. Remove all adult intruders not in combat
and put the corresponding intruder tokens back in the intruder bag
(if possible). Then, place an adult intruder model in the room where
the encounter occurred.

#### MARKERS

#### DOORS

```
Door tokens are only placed in corridors and a corridor may never
hold more than one. They do not affect noise markers.
```
```
Open doors are indicated by removing the door token from the
corridor. At the start of the game, all corridors have open doors.
If there are no door tokens left when you must place a door, take
any non-destroyed door token on the board.
Closed doors (standing door token) prevent characters, intruders,
and thrown grenades moving through the corridor. When one or
more intruders try to move through a corridor with a closed door
(including after a DANGER result on a noise roll), they do not move,
but destroy the door instead.
Destroyed (door token lying down) allow movement through the
corridor. A destroyed door can never be closed again.
```
#### FIRE

```
If you must place a fire marker and there are none left, the facility
explodes and the game ends. A room may never hold more than 1
fire marker (if you must place another, nothing happens). They may
be placed in an unexplored room. You can still use a room or search
action when there is a fire marker in a room.
```
#### MALFUNCTION

```
If there is a malfunction marker in a room, that room’s action is
unavailable (you may still search). A malfunction marker can never
be placed in the nest or in the contaminated room. If there is a
malfunction marker in a room with a computer, the computer is
unavailable (as if there was no computer symbol).
If you must place a malfunction marker and there are none left,
the base is destroyed and the game ends.
A room may never hold more than 1 malfunction marker (if you
must place another, nothing happens). They may not be placed in
an unexplored room.
```
#### SLIME

```
You may never have more than 1 slime marker at a time (if you get
another, nothing happens). You may get rid of a slime marker by
using the Clothes item card or by taking a decon room action.
```
#### ENCOUNTERS

```
An encounter occurs when, after drawing an intruder token from
the intruder bag, an intruder appears in a room where there is a
character. They may also be triggered by the effects of some event
or intruder attack cards. An intruder moving from one room to
another room where there is a character is not an encounter.
```
```
If you enter a room occupied by an intruder, do not resolve an
encounter: you and the intruder are immediately in combat.
```
```
To resolve an encounter:
```
1. Discard all noise markers from all the corridors connected to the
    room (including technical corridors).
2. Draw 1 intruder token from the intruder bag. There are 2
    numbers on the back: use the smaller blue number if you are
    not in darkness, and the larger red number if you are.
3. Place an intruder miniature in the room of a type corresponding
    to the intruder symbol on the token.
4. If the number of action cards (including contamination cards)
    in your hand is lower than the number on the intruder token, a
    surprise attack occurs. Otherwise nothing happens.
Put the drawn intruder token aside; it may return to the bag if an
intruder of that type hides (by entering the technical corridors
during intruder movement).
If you draw the blank token, place a noise marker in each corridor
connected to the room in which the encounter took place. If this
was the last token in the intruder bag, add 1 adult intruder token
to the bag. If there are none available, nothing happens. Return the
blank token to the intruder bag and the encounter ends.

#### COMBAT

```
A character and an intruder in the same room are in combat.
```
## CHARACTER ATTACKS INTRUDER

```
During your action round, you may attack an intruder in the same
room using a shoot action (if you have an energy/classic weapon
with at least 1 ammo) or a melee attack action.
```
#### SHOOT ACTION:

1. Choose a weapon and 1 intruder to shoot.
2. Discard 1 ammo from the weapon’s card.
3. Roll the combat die if in a section without power, or the
    advantage die if in a section with power (see reference sheet).

#### MELEE ATTACK ACTION:

1. Draw 1 contamination card and add it to your action discard pile.
2. Choose 1 intruder to attack.
3. Roll the combat die (the advantage die is not used in melee).

## CHARACTER ESCAPE

```
During your action round, you may try to escape from combat
by performing a movement action to go to a neighboring room
(explored or unexplored).
Before moving, resolve a separate intruder attack for each intruder
in the room you are escaping from.
If you die, your character corpse stays in the room you tried to
escape from. If you survive, end your movement in the neighboring
room. If there is no one in that room, perform a noise roll; if it is
unexplored, explore it as normal.
```
## INTRUDER ATTACK

```
Intruder attacks happen during a surprise attack, the intruder
attack step in the event phase, or during a character escape. Each
intruder attack follows these steps:
```
1. Choose a character in the same room as the target. If there is
    more than one, intruders attack the character with the fewest
    action cards in hand. On a tie, the character with the first player
    token (or the next player in turn order) is attacked.
Surprise attack: The target is whoever triggered the encounter.
Escape: The target is whoever is performing the escape action.
2. Draw and resolve 1 intruder attack card. If the card has an
    intruder symbol matching the attacking intruder, resolve the
    card effect (ignore the blood symbol), including any additional
    effects resolved only in sections without power, if appropriate.
    If not, the attack misses.

```
After resolving an intruder attack card, place it on the intruder
discard pile. If the intruder attack deck runs out of cards, reshuffle
its discard pile to form a new deck.
```
```
INFEST: If the intruder attack is performed by a larva, do not draw
any intruder attack cards. Instead, if the targeted player doesn’t
have a larva miniature on their character board, remove the larva
from the board and place it on their board. The player then takes 1
contamination card.
```
## ATTACKING PLAYERS

```
Characters cannot directly attack other characters, but may
accidentally or intentionally harm them as a side effect of their
actions.
```
#### CHARACTER WOUNDS AND DEATH

```
When you suffer a light wound, place a wound marker in the upper
space of your light wound track on your character board. If a marker
is already there, move it to the lower space (where it represents 2
light wounds).
If there is already a wound marker on the lower space, discard it
and suffer a serious wound. Draw 1 serious wound card (identical
cards are not cumulative). From now on, you are affected by the
effect described on it.
```
```
If you have 3 serious wounds and suffer any additional wound
(light or serious), you are killed. Remove your miniature from
the board and place a character corpse token and all your heavy
objects in the room. Remove your other items from the game.
```
#### DRESSING AND HEALING WOUNDS

```
Dress serious wound: Flip a serious wound card affecting you to its
other side. From now on, ignore its effect, but it still counts against
the limit of 3 serious wounds.
Heal: Either remove (light wound) or discard (dressed serious
wound card) the wound mentioned in the action effect.
```
#### INTRUDER INJURIES AND DEATH

```
When an intruder suffers injuries, place the corresponding number
of injury markers on its base. Then check the injury effect:
```
```
Larva or egg: Remove the miniature from the board.
```
```
Creeper or adult intruder: Draw 1 intruder attack card. Ignore
everything on it except the blood symbol.
If the number in the symbol is equal to or lower than the
current number of injury markers on the intruder, remove
its miniature and place 1 intruder carcass token in the
room. Otherwise, the intruder stays alive.
```
```
Breeder or queen: Draw 2 intruder attack cards, add the blood
symbol values, and compare the total to the current number of
injury markers on the intruder. Resolve as above.
```
```
During the injury effect check, if there is a retreat arrow in
the blood symbol of any of the drawn intruder attack
cards, the intruder flees.
Draw an event card and move the intruder through the corridor
whose number appears in the card’s intruder movement section;
then discard the card. The queen and breeders will retreat if any of
the 2 cards drawn has the retreat symbol.
```
#### CONTAMINATION CARDS

```
When you get a contamination card, place it on top of your action
discard pile. Contamination cards do not provide any additional
actions and cannot be spent to pay action costs.
```
```
If any rule asks you to remove a contamination card, place it at the
bottom of the deck. Whatever the procedure to get rid of the card,
it requires a scan. Place the scanner’s red part over the coded field
of the contamination card. If the word INFECTED does not appear,
the card is not infected. If it does appear, place a larva miniature on
your character board (and do not remove this contamination card).
If there is already one on your character board, your character dies,
and you place 1 creeper in the room where you died.
```
#### POWER

```
A facility section has power when its power token is on the blue
side. The section has these additional rules:
```
1. Use the advantage combat die when performing a shoot action.
2. Use special computer actions in rooms with a computer symbol.
3. Characters in the section are not in darkness for game effects.
4. Remove noise markers in the section during the event phase.

```
Characters in sections without power are in darkness. Characters in
darkness always resolve the higher value on a drawn intruder token.
```
```
Power thresholds are on the time track. Red thresholds reduce the
power only if the backup power is not activated (time token on red
side). Blue thresholds always reduce the power.
```
```
Each time the time token crosses a threshold, check if the
threshold activates. If the token is on its red side, it activates when
it crosses any threshold. If it is on its blue side, it activates only
when it crosses a threshold with 2 time token symbols.
If the threshold activates, flip the active power token with the
highest number to its inactive/red side.
```

#### KNOWLEDGE AND WEAKNESS

## KNOWLEDGE

Characters gain knowledge when performing these actions:

- 3 knowledge: Analyzing a weakness in the laboratory room or
    using the Analyze Toolset (regardless of what was discovered).
    Discard the object used.
- 1 knowledge: Using a specific computer action.
- 1 knowledge: Discovering the nest.
- 2 knowledge and flipping your knowledge token to its active
    side: Using the archive room action. If your knowledge token is
    active, you cannot use the archive room again.
- ## knowledge: Using some items or actions.

## WEAKNESS

To discover a weakness card, any character can research one of the
available objects (character corpse, intruder carcass, or egg) in the
laboratory room.

After researching an object, place it in the first empty slot of the
intruder board and reveal the weakness card below it. Heavy
objects are discarded when researched.

You cannot discover weaknesses using the same type of object
multiple times, but you can still analyze the same type of object any
number of times to gain knowledge.

#### OBJECTS AND ITEMS

#### CHARACTER HANDS AND INVENTORY

There are 2 types of item cards: heavy items (kept in your hands)
and normal items (kept in your inventory).

You may also carry object tokens, which are all heavy (character
corpse, intruder carcass, and egg).

All normal items may be kept secret from the other players in your
inventory (plastic card holder). Other players can only see the color
of the items. When any item card is used it must be shown to all
other players. There is no limit to the number of items that can be
in your inventory.

```
Heavy items (as weapons) are indicated by the hand
symbol. They can never be kept secret from the other
players and cannot be put in your inventory.
```
When you gain a heavy item (or pick up a heavy object) you wish to
keep, it must be placed in 1 of your 2 hand slots.

If both of the hand slots are already taken and you want to take
another heavy item/object, you must drop 1 of the carried heavy
items/objects.

Each weapon acquired during the game comes into play loaded
with ammo tokens. The first number is the starting number of
tokens and the second is its maximum ammo capacity. A weapon
can never exceed its ammo capacity.

Sometimes, you can add an item card to another item card; place
the added item next to the indicated item card. From now on, both
cards are treated as one.

The Duct Tape item card allows you to combine 2 heavy items, so
they take up only 1 hand slot (but it doesn’t apply to objects).

Item cards marked as one use only must be discarded after use.

#### DROP

You may drop any item/object from your hands/inventory any time
during your turn without using an action. Objects remain in the
room where they are dropped. Items are lost (return them to the
bottom of their deck).

#### SEARCHING

Apart from the character-dedicated items, there are 4 colors of
items: red (military), yellow (technical), green (medical), blue
(crafted).

```
The red, yellow, and green decks contain items which can be found
in rooms when using a search action.
```
```
The color of any item found during a search action should match
the color of the searched room (the background color under its
name and rule text).
```
```
When searching in a white room, the player can choose to draw
from any of these 3 decks.
```
```
Each time a character performs a search action in a room, reduce
the room’s item counter by 1. When the item counter reaches 0,
the room has been emptied and cannot be searched anymore.
```
#### CRAFTING

```
Blue deck item cards are crafted items which can be assembled
out of other items you have. You may look through this deck at any
time.
A crafted item cannot be built if its card is not available, even if you
have the required blue components.
To build a crafted item, perform a craft item basic action and
discard 2 item cards showing the blue component symbols
corresponding to the grey components symbols of the crafted item
you want to build. Then draw the desired crafted item card from
the deck.
```
#### QUEST ITEMS

```
Once the requirement of your quest card is fulfilled, it is flipped
faceup on its vertical side and becomes a normal item card.
```
#### PLAYER GOALS AND GAME END

```
To win, you must fulfill the objective on your objective card and
survive by either:
```
- Locking your character in the isolation room with the facility
    not destroyed or
- Using one of the CSS pods to evacuate the facility or
- Reaching the bunker.

```
If you use a CSS pod, isolate, or die, you can no longer participate
in the game.
```
```
At the end of the game, only characters that are still alive determine
if their objectives have been met and if they have won or not.
```
```
The game ends when one of these conditions is met:
```
```
a. The time token reaches the final S space of the time track. The
facility is purged by Corporation forces, regardless of the active
contingency token. All characters not in the isolation room die.
```
```
b. The time token is on the same slot as the red autodestruction
token and has to advance further or you must place a 13th fire
marker or an 11th malfunction marker. The facility explodes: all
characters in the facility (even those who have used the isolation
room) and all intruders and their queen die.
```
```
c. The last living character in the facility (excluding those who
have used the isolation room) dies, uses the isolation room,
flees to the bunker, or uses a CSS pod.
```
```
If the autodestruction sequence was active, move the time
token to the slot with the autodestruction token. If not, move
the time token to the final red slot of the time track. Resolve the
effects of those tokens as described above.
If the alert procedure was active, move the time token to the
slot with the alert procedure token. If not, move the time token
to the final red slot of the time track. Resolve the effects of those
tokens as described above.
```
```
If both autodestruction sequence and alert procedure were
active, they both count as the way of ending the game.
```
```
If one of the conditions above is met and at least 1 character
survived (either locked in the isolation room, safe in the bunker,
or evacuated in a CSS pod), go to the victory check step.
```
#### VICTORY CHECK

#### 1. CONTINGENCY CHECK

```
Reveal the active contingency token and apply its effect to all living
characters.
```
#### 2. CONTAMINATION CHECK

```
Each living character (either locked in the isolation room, safe in
the bunker, or evacuated in a CSS pod) scans their contamination
cards.
a. If there is a larva on your character board, skip this step. Scan all
the contamination cards in your action deck, discard pile, and
hand. If there is at least 1 INFECTED card, resolve step b.
b. Shuffle all your cards (both action and contamination) to create
a new action deck, then draw the 4 top cards. If you draw at
least 1 contamination card (INFECTED or not), you die. If there
are none, you survive.
```
#### 3. OBJECTIVE CHECK

```
If there are any characters still alive, each of them reveals their
objective card to the other players and checks to see if they have
met all its requirements. There can be more than 1 winner.
```
#### OBJECTIVES

```
PLAYER X’S CHARACTER CANNOT SURVIVE: That player’s character
cannot be alive at the end of the game.
```
```
YOUR CHARACTER IS THE ONLY SURVIVOR: No character but yours
may survive the game.
```
```
NO NEMESIS CHARACTER CAN SURVIVE: No survivor, lab rat, or any
character from Nemesis or the Aftermath expansion can survive
the game.
```
```
SENDING THE SIGNAL: You must locate the transmitter control
room and perform its room action.
```
```
DISCOVER A WEAKNESS: Weaknesses can be discovered by
bringing an object (intruder egg, character corpse, or intruder
carcass) to the laboratory and performing the laboratory room
action. It doesn’t matter who does the research, as long as the
weakness has been discovered at the end of the game. Intruder
eggs may be found in the nest.
```
```
DESTROY THE NEST: The nest is destroyed when there are no
intruder eggs left in it. To destroy eggs, see the nest room.
```
#### SOLO & COOPERATIVE MODE

## SOLO MODE

```
This mode has its own solo/coop objectives deck. At the start of the
game, draw 2 cards from this deck (instead of the regular objective
cards). Once the first encounter occurs, you must choose 1 of
these 2 objective cards.
To win, you must fulfill your objective and survive.
After placing the active contingency, draw 2 tokens from the
neutral pool instead of 1.
Reduce the items available in each room by half, rounding up.
```
## FULLY COOPERATIVE MODE

```
At the start of the game, place 1 contingency token in the active
contingency slot, and the rest of the tokens in the neutral pool.
Draw 1 of these tokens and reveal it to all players. The rest will be
revealed during the game; place them next to the first revealed
token.
This mode has its own solo/coop objectives deck. At the start of
the game, draw 1 card per player (instead of the regular objective
cards). These cards are public information. To win the game, all
these objectives must be fulfilled and at least 1 character must
survive.
```
```
If there is 1 card requiring you to send the signal, only 1 character
must fulfil it. If there are 2 or more such requirements, that many
characters must send the signal.
The emergency room allows the crew to revive any near-death
character. When a character dies, another character may pick
up their corpse token and carry it to the working emergency
room. A player whose corpse is in the emergency room places
their character miniature there at the start of the next round. All
their light wounds are discarded and all their serious wounds are
dressed. The emergency room does not work if there’s an intruder
or a malfunction token in it.
```
#### USING ORIGINAL NEMESIS CHARACTERS

```
If including characters from the original game, your character draft
card allows you to use the character of that same color from the
base game or the Aftermath expansion.
```
```
Nemesis characters are counted as Nemesis survivors and always
begin with 3 knowledge, in the isolation room.
```
```
With the exception of the Pilot, who uses the action deck from
Nemesis: Lockdown, characters use their original action decks. All
characters start without a starting item card and use the quest item
cards from Nemesis: Lockdown.
```
#### USING INTRUDERS IN NEMESIS: LOCKDOWN

```
To use the original intruder miniatures in Nemesis: Lockdown:
```
- Remove the Vulnerability to Fire and Susceptibility to
    Phosphates intruder weakness cards from the game.
- Flip the night stalkers laboratory board to the intruders
    laboratory side and place 5 egg tokens in the nest slot, and
    3 random intruders weakness cards facedown at the board’s
    bottom edge. Return the remaining weakness cards to the box.
- Replace the night stalker tokens with intruder tokens.
- Place the Lockdown intruders event deck (instead of the basic
    intruders event deck) and intruders attack deck next to the
    board.

```
Discovering a weakness follows Nemesis: Lockdown rules, with the
exception that a revealed weakness card is active for all players
without the need to reach certain knowledge levels.
```

and in a room with a computer may use a computer action to
perform one of the 3 actions on the revealed computer card.
Then, place the card on the bottom of the deck and reveal the
next one. Whenever a Lockdown card is revealed, resolve it.
```

#### MOVEMENT & EXPLORATION

After entering a room:

1. If the room was unexplored (facedown), turn it over.
    Then reveal and resolve the exploration token.
2. If the room is empty (explored or unexplored, but no other
    characters or intruders), perform a noise roll.

## EXPLORATION TOKENS

#### 1. SET UP NUMBER OF ITEMS IN A ROOM

Rotate the room tile until the number on the token faces the
item counter symbol on the board next to the room tile: this is
the number of items available. Do not do this in the nest room.

#### 2. RESOLVE SPECIAL EFFECT

After resolving an exploration token, remove it from the game.

```
SILENCE: Do not perform a noise roll. If this token was
revealed due to a careful movement, you still place a
noise marker. If you have a slime marker, resolve
DANGER instead.
```
```
DANGER: Do not perform a noise roll for this movement.
If there is an intruder in a neighboring room that is not
in combat with any character, move it to this room.
If there is more than 1 eligible intruder, move them all.
If there are no intruders in any of the neighboring
rooms (or if they are in combat), place a noise marker
in each corridor connected to the room without a
noise marker in it (including technical corridors).
```
```
SLIME: Place a status marker in the indicated slot
of your board: you have been covered with slime.
```
```
FIRE: Place a fire marker. A character who finishes a
turn in a room with a fire marker suffers 1 light wound.
```
```
MALFUNCTION: Place a malfunction marker.
DOORS: Place a door token in the non-technical
corridor through which you entered the room.
```
## NOISE ROLL

1, 2, 3 OR 4: Place a noise marker in a corridor with the matching
number that is connected to the room you entered (including
technical corridors).

```
SILENCE: See above under resolve special effect.
```
```
DANGER: See above under resolve special effect.
```
A corridor may never have more than 1 noise marker. If you
have to place a noise marker in a corridor that already has
one, resolve an encounter instead. If the noise marker number
leads to a technical corridors entrance, place the marker on the
technical corridors space.

## INTRUDER MOVEMENT

If an intruder ends its movement in an unexplored room, do not
reveal the room or its token.

If an intruder moves to a technical corridors entrance, discard
all its injury markers, return its token to the intruder bag,
and remove its miniature. If there was a noise marker on the
technical corridors space, do not remove it.

When an intruder tries to move through a corridor with a closed
door, it doesn’t move, but destroys the door. If several are
moving from the same room, their movement is simultaneous:
they destroy the door and all stay in the starting room.

If you must place an adult intruder and all 8 are on the board,
they retreat. Remove all adult intruders not in combat and put
their corresponding intruder tokens back in the bag (if possible).
Then, place an adult intruder model in the room where the
encounter occurred.

#### COMBAT

#### CHARACTER ATTACKS INTRUDER

```
You may attack an intruder in the same room using a shoot (if
you have a weapon with ammo) or a melee attack action.
```
#### SHOOT ACTION:

1. Choose a weapon and 1 intruder to shoot.
2. Discard 1 ammo from the weapon’s card.
3a. Roll the combat die if in a section without power:

```
You miss your target.
```
```
If your target is a larva or creeper,
deal 1 injury to your target. If not, you miss.
```
```
If your target is a larva, creeper or adult intruder,
deal 1 injury to your target. If not, you miss.
```
```
Deal 1 injury to your target
(regardless of the intruder’s type).
```
```
Deal 2 injuries to your target
(regardless of the intruder’s type).
```
```
3b. Roll the advantage die instead if in a section with power:
Discard an action card to deal 1 damage to your
target.
```
```
Deal 1 injury to your target. Discard an action card
to deal 2 injuries instead.
```
#### MELEE ATTACK ACTION:

1. Draw 1 contamination card; add it to your action discard pile.
2. Choose 1 intruder to attack.
3. Roll the combat die (the advantage die is not used in
    melee):

```
You miss your target and your character
suffers 1 serious wound.
```
```
If your target is a larva or creeper, deal 1 injury to
your target. If not, you miss and your character
suffers 1 serious wound.
```
```
If your target is a larva, creeper or adult intruder,
deal 1 injury to your target. If not, you miss and your
character suffers 1 serious wound.
Deal 1 injury to your target
(regardless of the intruder’s type).
Deal 1 injury (yes, only 1) to your target
(regardless of the intruder’s type).
```
#### CHARACTER ESCAPE

```
You may try to escape from combat by performing a movement
action to go to a neighboring room. First resolve a separate
intruder attack for each intruder in the room you are escaping
from. If you survive, end your move in the neighboring room.
```
#### INTRUDER ATTACK

```
Intruder attacks happen during a surprise attack, the intruder
attack step in the event phase, or during a character escape.
```
1. Choose a character in the same room as the target. If there
    are several, attack who has the fewest action cards in hand.
Surprise attack: The target is who triggered the encounter.
Escape: The target is who performed the escape action.
2. Draw and resolve 1 intruder attack card. If the card has an
    intruder symbol corresponding to the attacking intruder,
    resolve the effect. If not, the attack misses.

```
INFEST: If the intruder attack is performed by a larva, do not
draw any intruder attack cards. Instead, if you don’t have a larva
on your character board, place the larva on their board. You
then take 1 contamination card.
```
#### MOVEMENT & EXPLORATION

```
After entering a room:
```
1. If the room was unexplored (facedown), turn it over.
    Then reveal and resolve the exploration token.
2. If the room is empty (explored or unexplored, but no other
    characters or intruders), perform a noise roll.

## EXPLORATION TOKENS

#### 1. SET UP NUMBER OF ITEMS IN A ROOM

```
Rotate the room tile until the number on the token faces the
item counter symbol on the board next to the room tile: this is
the number of items available. Do not do this in the nest room.
```
#### 2. RESOLVE SPECIAL EFFECT

```
After resolving an exploration token, remove it from the game.
```
```
SILENCE: Do not perform a noise roll. If this token was
revealed due to a careful movement, you still place a
noise marker. If you have a slime marker, resolve
DANGER instead.
```
```
DANGER: Do not perform a noise roll for this movement.
If there is an intruder in a neighboring room that is not
in combat with any character, move it to this room.
If there is more than 1 eligible intruder, move them all.
If there are no intruders in any of the neighboring
rooms (or if they are in combat), place a noise marker
in each corridor connected to the room without a
noise marker in it (including technical corridors).
```
```
SLIME: Place a status marker in the indicated slot
of your board: you have been covered with slime.
```
```
FIRE: Place a fire marker. A character who finishes a
turn in a room with a fire marker suffers 1 light wound.
```
```
MALFUNCTION: Place a malfunction marker.
DOORS: Place a door token in the non-technical
corridor through which you entered the room.
```
## NOISE ROLL

```
1, 2, 3 OR 4: Place a noise marker in a corridor with the matching
number that is connected to the room you entered (including
technical corridors).
```
```
SILENCE: See above under resolve special effect.
```
```
DANGER: See above under resolve special effect.
```
```
A corridor may never have more than 1 noise marker. If you
have to place a noise marker in a corridor that already has
one, resolve an encounter instead. If the noise marker number
leads to a technical corridors entrance, place the marker on the
technical corridors space.
```
## INTRUDER MOVEMENT

```
If an intruder ends its movement in an unexplored room, do not
reveal the room or its token.
If an intruder moves to a technical corridors entrance, discard
all its injury markers, return its token to the intruder bag,
and remove its miniature. If there was a noise marker on the
technical corridors space, do not remove it.
When an intruder tries to move through a corridor with a closed
door, it doesn’t move, but destroys the door. If several are
moving from the same room, their movement is simultaneous:
they destroy the door and all stay in the starting room.
If you must place an adult intruder and all 8 are on the board,
they retreat. Remove all adult intruders not in combat and put
their corresponding intruder tokens back in the bag (if possible).
Then, place an adult intruder model in the room where the
encounter occurred.
```
#### COMBAT

#### CHARACTER ATTACKS INTRUDER

```
You may attack an intruder in the same room using a shoot (if
you have a weapon with ammo) or a melee attack action.
```
#### SHOOT ACTION:

1. Choose a weapon and 1 intruder to shoot.
2. Discard 1 ammo from the weapon’s card.
3a. Roll the combat die if in a section without power:

```
You miss your target.
```
```
If your target is a larva or creeper,
deal 1 injury to your target. If not, you miss.
```
```
If your target is a larva, creeper or adult intruder,
deal 1 injury to your target. If not, you miss.
```
```
Deal 1 injury to your target
(regardless of the intruder’s type).
```
```
Deal 2 injuries to your target
(regardless of the intruder’s type).
```
```
3b. Roll the advantage die instead if in a section with power:
Discard an action card to deal 1 damage to your
target.
```
```
Deal 1 injury to your target. Discard an action card
to deal 2 injuries instead.
```
#### MELEE ATTACK ACTION:

1. Draw 1 contamination card; add it to your action discard pile.
2. Choose 1 intruder to attack.
3. Roll the combat die (the advantage die is not used in
    melee):

```
You miss your target and your character
suffers 1 serious wound.
```
```
If your target is a larva or creeper, deal 1 injury to
your target. If not, you miss and your character
suffers 1 serious wound.
```
```
If your target is a larva, creeper or adult intruder,
deal 1 injury to your target. If not, you miss and your
character suffers 1 serious wound.
Deal 1 injury to your target
(regardless of the intruder’s type).
Deal 1 injury (yes, only 1) to your target
(regardless of the intruder’s type).
```
#### CHARACTER ESCAPE

```
You may try to escape from combat by performing a movement
action to go to a neighboring room. First resolve a separate
intruder attack for each intruder in the room you are escaping
from. If you survive, end your move in the neighboring room.
```
#### INTRUDER ATTACK

```
Intruder attacks happen during a surprise attack, the intruder
attack step in the event phase, or during a character escape.
```
1. Choose a character in the same room as the target. If there
    are several, attack who has the fewest action cards in hand.
Surprise attack: The target is who triggered the encounter.
Escape: The target is who performed the escape action.
2. Draw and resolve 1 intruder attack card. If the card has an
    intruder symbol corresponding to the attacking intruder,
    resolve the effect. If not, the attack misses.

```
INFEST: If the intruder attack is performed by a larva, do not
draw any intruder attack cards. Instead, if you don’t have a larva
on your character board, place the larva on their board. You
then take 1 contamination card.
```

#### ROOMS

You cannot perform a room action if it has a malfunction
marker or if you are in combat. A computer symbol means the
room has a computer. If there is a malfunction marker in the
room, treat the room as if there was no computer symbol.

Draw and resolve 1 card from the Mars surface deck.
Then perform a noise roll (or place a noise marker).
When you have to resolve a malfunction exploration
token effect on a crossroads, nothing happens.
```
###### MARS SURFACE

```
Crossroads are special rooms which cannot have a malfunction
or fire marker and connected by paths. Characters and intruders
can use paths to move between crossroads. Noise markers are
never placed on paths.
Areas are a special type of technical corridor connected only to
their particular building (##3 is not connected to any building).
All crossroads on the Mars surface are connected to all areas,
so when you perform a noise roll on a crossroads, place a noise
maker on an area with the matching number (as you would in a
technical corridors space). Any effects that reference technical
corridors cannot be applied to areas.
You can move on the Mars surface on foot, or by Rover. If the
Rover is in any of the exit rooms, a character there may use it if
they are not in combat:
```
```
Move your character and the Rover to any other exit room.
You do not perform a noise roll.
Move your character and the Rover to the bunker; you
have escaped the facility safely.
You can use a movement action to move from an exit room to a
connected crossroads, or between connected crossroads. Then
perform the normal steps of revealing a token and performing
a noise roll (do not perform a noise roll if there is an intruder or
another character on the crossroads).
```
###### BUILDINGS

```
Buildings are clusters of rooms. They work like normal rooms,
but provide some protection against the effects of Mars surface
cards, and can be accessed through an exit room (a room
connected by a path to a crossroads). You can move between
buildings on foot, or using a Rover.
```
```
ESCAPE THE FACILITY: You must be on a crossroads
connected by a path to the bunker, have an Enviro-Suit
item, and perform a noise roll. If any intruder appears, the
attempt fails. If no intruder appears, move your character to the
bunker; you have escaped the facility safely.
```
###### MARS SURFACE DIE AND DECK

```
Whenever you are on the surface part of the facility and you
perform a noise roll, use the Mars surface die.
```
```
1-4 and SILENCE: Resolve as normal.
```
```
DANGER: When rolled in a building, resolve as normal. The area
around the building is treated as a technical corridor connected
to all rooms in that building. When rolled on a crossroads, move
all intruders on the Mars surface (except those in buildings or in
combat) to the crossroads you are on. If there are none eligible,
place a noise marker in each area that does not have one.
```
```
When you roll this symbol, draw and resolve a Mars
surface card. The upper part is applied either to all
characters on the Mars surface or the character who
drew the card (unless the character has an Enviro-suit item or is
in a building, in which case they apply the bottom part)
```
#### SPECIAL ROOMS

When a character restores power:
```
1. Reset the power: Do not perform this step if 3 or more power
    tokens are on the active side. Flip the 2 lowest numbered
    power tokens to their blue side. Flip all other power tokens to
    their red side.
2. Rearrange power tokens: Place all the power tokens in
    chosen sections as you wish (do not flip them).

Additionally, if the time token is inactive:

3. Flip over the time token to its active/blue side, showing that
    the power has been restored.

###### ELEVATOR ROOM S-01/S-02/S-

If the elevator has power and your character is not in combat,
you may:

CALL THE ELEVATOR: Place the elevator token next to the
elevator room in your section.
OR

If the elevator has power, there is an elevator token next to this
room, and your character is not in combat, you may:

USE THE ELEVATOR: Place your character and the elevator
token next to the elevator room in another section. You
may take any other characters in the room you are in, if they
agree. Do not perform a noise roll afterwards.

###### EMERGENCY STAIRCASES

Emergency staircases are black rooms between sections (they
are not treated as part of any section); always in darkness and
with no action. They can contain a malfunction marker.

###### REPOSITORY

CRAFT EQUIPMENT: In this room you may perform the
craft item action. If you do, you may discard 1 fewer item
card to build an item.

###### ISOLATION ROOM

When your character is in this room at the start of a new round,
draw 1 additional action card (ie, up to 6).

This passive feature does not work if there is a malfunction
token in the room.

LOCK YOURSELF IN: You may only perform this action if the
isolation room is open (the token on the time track is on
any white slot or the alert procedure token is on the time track).

Perform a noise roll. If any intruder appears, your attempt fails. If
no intruder appears, remove your miniature from the game; you
do not take part any longer.

Other players can still initiate the autodestruction sequence

can use paths to move between crossroads. Noise markers are
never placed on paths.
Areas are a special type of technical corridor connected only to
their particular building (##3 is not connected to any building).
All crossroads on the Mars surface are connected to all areas,
so when you perform a noise roll on a crossroads, place a noise
maker on an area with the matching number (as you would in a

corridors cannot be applied to areas.
You can move on the Mars surface on foot, or by Rover. If the
Rover is in any of the exit rooms, a character there may use it if
they are not in combat:
```
```
Move your character and the Rover to any other exit room.
You do not perform a noise roll.
Move your character and the Rover to the bunker; you
have escaped the facility safely.
You can use a movement action to move from an exit room to a
connected crossroads, or between connected crossroads. Then
perform the normal steps of revealing a token and performing
a noise roll (do not perform a noise roll if there is an intruder or
another character on the crossroads).
```
###### BUILDINGS

```
Buildings are clusters of rooms. They work like normal rooms,
but provide some protection against the effects of Mars surface
cards, and can be accessed through an exit room (a room
connected by a path to a crossroads). You can move between
buildings on foot, or using a Rover.
```
```
ESCAPE THE FACILITY: You must be on a crossroads
connected by a path to the bunker, have an Enviro-Suit
item, and perform a noise roll. If any intruder appears, the
attempt fails. If no intruder appears, move your character to the
bunker; you have escaped the facility safely.
```
###### MARS SURFACE DIE AND DECK

```
Whenever you are on the surface part of the facility and you
perform a noise roll, use the Mars surface die.
```
```
1-4 and SILENCE: Resolve as normal.
```
```
DANGER: When rolled in a building, resolve as normal. The area
around the building is treated as a technical corridor connected
to all rooms in that building. When rolled on a crossroads, move
all intruders on the Mars surface (except those in buildings or in
combat) to the crossroads you are on. If there are none eligible,
place a noise marker in each area that does not have one.
```
```
When you roll this symbol, draw and resolve a Mars
surface card. The upper part is applied either to all
characters on the Mars surface or the character who
drew the card (unless the character has an Enviro-suit item or is
in a building, in which case they apply the bottom part)
```

#### ROOMS

You cannot perform a room action if it has a malfunction
marker or if you are in combat.

A computer symbol means the room has a computer. If there is
a malfunction marker in the room, treat the room as if there was
no computer symbol.

Special rooms (SPECIAL) are explored at the start of the game

in a room containing uncarried eggs, destroy 1 uncarried egg
during the fire damage step of the event phase.

Destroying eggs: If you are in a room with any uncarried eggs,
you may try to destroy them with a SHOOT or MELEE ATTACK
action. Each injury (of any type) destroys 1 egg. If melee, do not
draw a contamination card or suffer wounds if you miss. After
every attempt to destroy an egg, you must perform a noise roll.

###### POWER GENERATOR (I)

STOP AUTODESTRUCTION SEQUENCE: If there is an
autodestruction token yellow side up on the time track,
discard it.

```
```
Draw 1 card from the yellow item deck.
```
```
Draw 1 card from the green item deck.
Draw and resolve 1 card from the Mars surface deck.
Then perform a noise roll (or place a noise marker).
When you have to resolve a malfunction exploration
token effect on a crossroads, nothing happens.
```
###### MARS SURFACE

```
Crossroads are special rooms which cannot have a malfunction
or fire marker and connected by paths. Characters and intruders
can use paths to move between crossroads. Noise markers are
never placed on paths.
Areas are a special type of technical corridor connected only to
their particular building (##3 is not connected to any building).
All crossroads on the Mars surface are connected to all areas,
so when you perform a noise roll on a crossroads, place a noise
maker on an area with the matching number (as you would in a
technical corridors space). Any effects that reference technical
corridors cannot be applied to areas.
```
```
You can move on the Mars surface on foot, or by Rover. If the
Rover is in any of the exit rooms, a character there may use it if
they are not in combat:
```
```
Move your character and the Rover to any other exit room.
You do not perform a noise roll.
Move your character and the Rover to the bunker; you
have escaped the facility safely.
```
```
You can use a movement action to move from an exit room to a
connected crossroads, or between connected crossroads. Then
perform the normal steps of revealing a token and performing
a noise roll (do not perform a noise roll if there is an intruder or
another character on the crossroads).
```
###### BUILDINGS

```
Buildings are clusters of rooms. They work like normal rooms,
but provide some protection against the effects of Mars surface
cards, and can be accessed through an exit room (a room
connected by a path to a crossroads). You can move between
buildings on foot, or using a Rover.
```
```
ESCAPE THE FACILITY: You must be on a crossroads
connected by a path to the bunker, have an Enviro-Suit
item, and perform a noise roll. If any intruder appears, the
attempt fails. If no intruder appears, move your character to the
bunker; you have escaped the facility safely.
```
###### MARS SURFACE DIE AND DECK

```
Whenever you are on the surface part of the facility and you
perform a noise roll, use the Mars surface die.
```
```
1-4 and SILENCE: Resolve as normal.
```
```
DANGER: When rolled in a building, resolve as normal. The area
around the building is treated as a technical corridor connected
to all rooms in that building. When rolled on a crossroads, move
all intruders on the Mars surface (except those in buildings or in
combat) to the crossroads you are on. If there are none eligible,
place a noise marker in each area that does not have one.
```
```
When you roll this symbol, draw and resolve a Mars
surface card. The upper part is applied either to all
characters on the Mars surface or the character who
drew the card (unless the character has an Enviro-suit item or is
in a building, in which case they apply the bottom part)
```
###### LABORATORY (I)

```
ANALYZE 1 OBJECT: You may only perform this action if a
character corpse, intruder carcass or egg is in the room (or
carried by the character). Gain 3 knowledge. Place the
object in the first empty slot on the laboratory board, then
flip the weakness card below the object. If the object was
previously used to discover a weakness, discard it instead.
```
###### NEST (I)

```
The character who explored this room gains 1 knowledge.
You cannot perform any search action in this room.

```
TAKE ONE EGG: Take 1 egg token from the intruder board
and perform a noise roll. When there are no more eggs in
the nest (all been carried away or destroyed), the nest is
destroyed (place 1 injury marker there). If there is a fire marker
in a room containing uncarried eggs, destroy 1 uncarried egg
during the fire damage step of the event phase.
Destroying eggs: If you are in a room with any uncarried eggs,
you may try to destroy them with a SHOOT or MELEE ATTACK
action. Each injury (of any type) destroys 1 egg. If melee, do not
draw a contamination card or suffer wounds if you miss. After
every attempt to destroy an egg, you must perform a noise roll.
```
###### POWER GENERATOR (I)

```
STOP AUTODESTRUCTION SEQUENCE: If there is an
autodestruction token yellow side up on the time track,
discard it.
OR
POWER A SECTION: Flip the power token of the section
you are in (even if the time token is on its inactive side).
```
###### TESTING LAB (II)

```
KNOWLEDGE 4: TAKE NEUTRALIZER: If your character has
at least 4 knowledge, take the Neutralizer crafted item.

1 light wound and you automatically pass. Shuffle all your
action cards (also those in your hand and discard pile)
and place them in your action deck. Then pass.
```
###### VENT CONTROL ROOM (II)

```
VENT OUT: Choose a room with a technical
corridors entrance. The corridors connected to
the room must not contain any destroyed doors.
Close the doors in each corridor connected to
the room. Remove a fire marker from the room (if any)
and place the venting token there. If any of the connected
doors are opened or destroyed before the current player
phase ends, remove the token.
If the token remains at the end of the current player
phase, everything in that room dies immediately.
Discard the token.
```
#### ALTERNATIVE SIDE OF THE BOARD
