## Quick Start Rules Guide

1. Setup:
   - Choose a scenario from the rulebook.
   - Each player gets a deck of cards based on their faction (Free Peoples or Shadow).
   - Shuffle and place the battleground and path decks in the center.
   - Draw your starting hand of cards.

2. Game Round:
   Each round has 5 steps. Follow them in order:

   a) Location: Flip over 1 battleground card and 1 path card.
   
   b) Action: Take turns doing ONE of these:
      - Play a card from your hand
      - Move a character or army
      - Swap a card from your hand with one from your deck
      - Pass (if you pass, you're done for this step)
   
   c) Combat: Fight at all active locations:
      - Count attack icons on your cards
      - Compare to defense icons on opponent's cards
      - Highest total wins the location
   
   d) Check for Victory: 
      - Count your points
      - If you're 10 points ahead, you win!
      - If not, keep playing
   
   e) Draw: Get new cards as the scenario tells you

3. Winning:
   - Get 10 points more than your opponent
   - OR have the most points after the final path card

Remember, each card has special abilities. Read them carefully and use them wisely!

# War of the Ring: The Card Game - Rules

## SETUP

Choose a scenario. Each player prepares their deck, shuffling
together all the cards of the appropriate factions (see the scenario
section for card decks and any modifications to the following
setup rules).

Each player takes a Ring token and a player aid. The Frodo player
takes the starting player token.

Separate the Shadow and Free Peoples battleground cards and
shuffle each of decks separately.

Assemble the path deck. Stack the cards so that the three path
1 cards are on top, followed by the three path 2 cards, and so on
through to path 9.

Each player draws the number of cards indicated by the scenario,
then may be required to cycle some of those cards. To cycle a
card, place it facedown in your cycle pile, to the right of your draw
deck.

The turn order tracker helps to keep track of the standard turn
order when you can’t sit around the table, or when you play with
fewer than 4 players. Place the starting player token and the turn
order marker on the Frodo space of the tracker. Advance the turn
order marker whenever a player takes a turn, and advance the
starting player token at the end of each round.

You must always allow other players to examine a card when some
aspect of the face of the card is being referenced, such as when a
specific card is taken from your draw deck. You may inspect your
own cycle pile and eliminated pile, which is helpful in determining
if a particular card is in your draw deck. You may always inspect
faceup cards in play.

You may not show any other players your hand. Conversations
between teammates must take place at the table, in public.

## THE GAME ROUND

## 1. LOCATION STEP

The starting player first activates 1 battleground, then activates
1 path. Whenever you activate (or reactivate) a battleground or
path, place it faceup in the middle of the table and resolve its
activation text.

Paths and battlegrounds may also be activated by certain faction
cards during the action step. These rules apply in both cases:

#### ACTIVATING BATTLEGROUNDS

Unless stated otherwise in the scenario rules, the battleground
activated during the location step is selected at random from
those in the battleground deck of the starting player’s team.

If your own side’s battleground deck has been depleted, draw
a battleground from the other side’s battleground deck. If both
battleground decks are depleted, do not activate a battleground
during the location step.

When a battleground is activated due to a card’s game text
or activation text, do not select it at random; if more than 1
battleground matches a card’s text, the activating player may
choose one. After you take a specific battleground from a deck,
shuffle the deck.

There is no limit to the number of battlegrounds that can be
simultaneously active.

#### REACTIVATING BATTLEGROUNDS

```
If a card’s text directs you to reactivate a battleground, instead of
taking it from its battleground deck, take it from a scoring area.
When you reactivate a battleground, its activation text is resolved
again. Attackers and defenders do not change.
```
#### ACTIVATING PATHS

```
Unless stated otherwise in the scenario rules, in the location step
of the first round, the starting player selects a random path 1 card
from among the three available. On subsequent rounds, the path
activated during the location step is selected at random from
among the path cards with a number one higher than the last path
activated in the prior round.
```
```
Only 1 path can be active at a time. If a card’s text activates a
path, the currently active path is replaced. However, before the
new path’s activation text is resolved, combat is immediately
resolved on the path being replaced (in the middle of the action
step). This combat is in addition to the path combat that will be
resolved during the combat step.
```
```
When a card allows you to activate a different path, you may
choose among the eligible paths (it is not chosen at random).
```
```
Unlike battlegrounds, a specific path cannot be activated more
than once per game. You cannot use a faction card’s text if
it would require you to activate a path that has already been
activated in this game.
```
#### RESOLVING COMBAT

```
Battleground combat is always resolved during the combat step.
Path combat is resolved:
a. During the action step whenever a new path is activated, and
b. During the combat step.
```
## 2. ACTION STEP

```
Players take turns taking actions, beginning with the starting
player and proceeding in the order specified in the scenario.
On your turn you may take 1 action, or possibly pass. Play
continues until all players have passed consecutively, when the
action step ends.
Possible actions:
```
- Play 1 card from your hand.
- Move 1 character or army in reserve to an active path or
    battleground.
- Cycle 1 card from your hand.
- Winnow by eliminating 2 cards from your hand to draw 1 card.
- Use an action to resolve the text of a card in play indicating you
    may ‘use an action to...’
- Use a Ring token to draw cards.

```
Instead of taking an action, you may pass, but only when the
number of cards in your hand is less than or equal to your
carryover limit or the number of cards in your hand is less than
each enemy player.
```
```
You may pass on one turn and still take an action on your next,
provided the action step does not end before your next turn.
```
```
The carryover limit is the maximum number of cards a player
can have in hand at the end of the action step; at the start of the
game it is 2.
```
## PLAYING A CARD

```
When you play a card, take it from your hand and use it in a way
that depends on the card’s type. Every time you play a card, you
must cycle a different card from your hand immediately, before
resolving the text on the card played. When you cycle a card,
place it facedown on your cycle pile.
```
```
If you want to play the last card in your hand, you must forsake a
card, since you have no other cards in your hand to cycle.
```
```
A faction card is in play when it is either in reserve, on a
battleground, or on a path. Cards in your draw deck, cycle pile, or
eliminated pile are not in play.
```
```
When you play an army card, place it faceup on an active
battleground or in your reserve area. To play or move an army to
a battleground, its faction must be one of those indicated by its
army icon as an attacker or defender there. Armies may not be
played or moved to paths.
When you play a character card, place it faceup on an active
path, an active battleground, or in your reserve area. To play or
move a character to a battleground, its faction must be one of
those indicated by its character icon as an attacker or defender
there. To play or move a character to a path, that path’s number
must be listed on the character’s card.
```
```
PLAYING AN ITEM
An item is always played onto a character card, which becomes
its wielder.
```
```
An item can only be played on one of the wielders indicated on the
card, and the wielder must already be in play.
```
```
If a wielder is moved from reserve to a path or battleground, the
wielder’s items move with it.
Icons on an item card are added to the icons of its wielder. In
combat, items with defense icons cannot cancel attack icons
separately from the character wielding it, unless the item affects
the location and not the wielder.
If a wielder is eliminated, any items with the wielder are also
eliminated. If the wielder is cycled, any items with the wielder are
also cycled.
Items cannot be transferred between wielders.
```
```
When an item has a different faction than its wielder, it can move
with its wielder to any battleground the wielder can be moved.
Items are not subject to the faction restrictions of battlegrounds
for armies and characters. An item is always cycled to its original
player’s cycle pile, even if the wielder is controlled by a different
player. An item on a wielder in reserve can only be forsaken on
behalf of the player controlling the wielder, who is not necessarily
the player that played the card.
```
```
PLAYING AN EVENT
When you play an event card, immediately resolve the text on the
card, then eliminate the card. Event cards are never in play and
cannot be placed in reserve.
```
```
PLAYING TO THE RESERVE AREA
Cards played to your reserve area cannot be moved in the same
round. Text that applies when a card is in the reserve area is
immediately effective (you need not wait until the next round).
To remember which cards have been played to your reserve in
the current round, you may rotate them, turning them back at the
beginning of the next round.
```
```
SPECIAL CASES
When a card directs you to perform multiple actions, do them in
the order presented.
When a card directs you to cycle, forsake, or eliminate a card, this
requirement is in addition to the card that must be cycled as the
usual cost of playing the card.
```
```
Many cards direct you to draw a number of cards, then play one or
more of those drawn, and then cycle the rest (that is, all unplayed
cards). In this case, the cards that you’re directed to cycle satisfy
the requirement to cycle a card for each one played.
```
```
You can never play the exact same character or item card twice in
the same round.
```
## OTHER ACTIONS

###### CYCLE (FROM YOUR HAND)

```
Cycle a card from your hand, placing it facedown on your cycle pile.
```
```
MOVE
Move an army or character card from your reserve to an active
path or battleground.
```
```
You cannot move a card where you could not play that card, and
you cannot take a move action for a card that was played to your
reserve this round.
```
```
Some character cards have text that is resolved specifically when
the card is played. This text is not resolved when the card is moved.
```
```
‘USE AN ACTION’ OF A CARD IN PLAY
Resolve the text of a card in play that specifies you may use an
action to do something. When text requires you to use an action to
do something, the text does not apply if you did not take an action.
```
```
USE A RING TOKEN
In the Trilogy scenario, as an action, once per game, you may use
your Ring token to draw 2 cards. Discard the token as a reminder.
If the Ring token is not used during the Trilogy scenario, it is worth
1 VP during final scoring after path 9.
```
```
The use of Ring tokens can be different depending on the
scenario you play.
```
```
WINNOW
Eliminate 2 cards from your hand, and then draw 1 card.
```
## 3. COMBAT STEP

```
Combats are resolved on each active battleground and on the
active path. Path combat might be also resolved during the action
step, if a new path is activated.
```
```
During the combat step, the starting player decides the order the
combats are resolved. Combat is resolved even if only 1 team has
cards on the path or battleground, or if neither team does.
```
#### COMBAT TOKENS

```
Some cards add combat icons according to their text. Use the
combat tokens to keep track of icons added by a card.
```
```
These tokens can either improve the defense value of a path or
battleground, or improve the attack or defense value of one of the
cards on the path or battleground.
```
```
A defense icon added to a path or battleground always cancels
out attack icons before the defending characters and armies are
affected.
```
```
An icon added to a character or army is considered to be part of
that character or army, and cannot be used to cancel out attack
icons separately.
```
## PATH COMBAT

```
On a path, the Free Peoples side is always the defender and the
Shadow is always the attacker.
```
1. Count the number of icons on Shadow cards and tokens on
    the path.
2. Cancel a number of icons equal to the number of icons
    on the path itself, including any defense tokens added to the
    path.
3. If there are any remaining icons, the Free Peoples player(s)
    must cancel as many of them as possible, eliminating their
    cards from the path until either the number of icons
    eliminated equals or exceeds the number of remaining
    icons, or they run out of cards.
4. Any leftover Free Peoples cards on the path are cycled.


A Free Peoples character must be eliminated if it cancels even a
single icon, regardless of how many icons it has (remember
that items with defense icons cannot cancel attack icons
separately from the character wielding them).

At the end of path combat, all Shadow characters in that combat
are eliminated.

If the Free Peoples players cannot decide which characters to
eliminate, the Shadow players can decide for them.

In the Trilogy scenario, if the Free Peoples can cancel out all the
icons, the Free Peoples place the path in their scoring area,
where it is worth the number of VPs printed on the path.

If the Free Peoples cannot cancel out all the icons, the Shadow
team adds to the Shadow scoring area as many corruption tokens
as there are uncanceled icons remaining, along with the path.
Keep the path card facedown as a reminder that its VP value does
not apply.

## BATTLEGROUND COMBAT

On a battleground, one side is the defender and the other side
the attacker. On a Shadow battleground, the Shadow side is
always the defender, and the Free Peoples side is the attacker;
on a Free Peoples battleground, the Free Peoples side is the
defender and the Shadow side is the attacker.

The attacking and defending factions of a battleground are fixed
by the battleground card, regardless of how it is activated.

If a battleground from one side’s battleground deck is reactivated
from the other side’s scoring area, the battleground’s icons are
ignored (they do not cancel out the attackers’ icons).

1. Count the number of icons on attacking cards.
2. Cancel a number of icons equal to the number of icons
    on the battleground itself, including any defense tokens added
    to the battleground ( icons or defense tokens on characters
    or armies are considered in the next step).
3. If there are any remaining icons, the defending player(s)
    must cancel as many of them as possible, eliminating their
    cards from the battleground until either the number of
    icons eliminated equals or exceeds the number of remaining
       icons, or they run out of cards.
4. Any leftover defending cards on the battleground are cycled.

A defending card must be eliminated if it cancels even 1 icon,
regardless of how many icons it has.

At the end of battleground combat, all attacking cards are
eliminated. If the defenders cannot decide which characters or
armies to eliminate, the attackers can decide for them.

If the defender can cancel out all icons, the defender wins.
Otherwise, the attacker wins.

The winning side takes control of the battleground and places it in
their scoring area.

#### CHARACTERS IN BATTLEGROUND COMBAT

Characters only gain combat icons (or gain additional icons) when
leading an army. These leadership icons are shown as a smaller
icon within a circle.

For a leadership icon to be counted in combat, the character
must have an army of the same faction on the same battleground.
The army supports the character. An army can only support 1
character.

On defense, when taking losses to cancel out attack icons, an
army and the character it is supporting can be lost separately; the
leadership icons will still be counted, in the current combat, if one
is eliminated and not the other.

If a character in combat is wielding items, remember that items
cannot cancel attack icons separately from the character.

## 4. VICTORY CHECK

```
During this step, each team calculates its score.
```
- If the difference between the two teams’ scores is 10 or more,
    then the team with the higher score wins and the game ends.
- After combat is resolved on the last path of a scenario, the
    team with the higher score wins. In the case of a tie, the
    Shadow wins.

## 5. DRAW STEP

```
As instucted in the scenario, players draw a number of cards from
their deck. Finally, the starting player token is passed to the next
player in the order given in the scneario.
```
## GAME PROCEDURES

#### CYCLE

```
When you cycle a card, place it facedown on your cycle pile. You
may always examine your own cycle pile.
```
```
When a card’s text directs you to cycle a card, this is in addition to
the card that must be cycled to play the card.
```
```
If you have no cards left in your hand, and you are required to
cycle a card from your hand, you must forsake a card instead.
This includes when you want to play the last card in your hand.
```
#### DRAW

```
Take the top card of your draw deck. While drawn cards usually
end up in your hand, there are exceptions.
```
```
There is no limit to the number of cards you can have in your
hand, except at the end of the action step when you cannot have
more than your carryover limit.
```
```
When you deplete your draw deck, you must immediately recycle
your cycle pile. Shuffle your cycle pile and place it facedown on
the table as your new draw deck. If you were in the middle of
drawing cards when you triggered the recycle, after recycling
finish drawing until you’ve taken the required number of cards.
```
```
If a recycle is caused by game text, shuffle the cards in your cycle
pile into your draw deck.
```
#### ELIMINATE

```
When you eliminate a card, place it facedown in your eliminated
pile. You may always examine your own eliminated pile. Once a
card is eliminated, it will not re-enter play.
Whenever you eliminate a card, check it for text that applies when
it is eliminated. If it has such text, reveal the card to the other
players and resolve the appropriate text.
```
```
Otherwise, do not reveal cards eliminated from your hand or your
draw deck to the other players.
```
```
When you are directed to eliminate a card, but you are unable to
do so, there is no further penalty. However, in a case where you
may voluntarily eliminate cards to gain some benefit, you cannot
gain the benefit if you cannot eliminate.
```
#### FORSAKE

```
When you are directed to forsake a card, you must eliminate a
card, choosing:
```
- A card of your choice from your hand; or
- A card of your choice from your reserve (you may forsake an
    item separately from its wielder); or
- The top card of your draw deck.

```
You cannot examine the top card of your draw deck before making
the decision to forsake the card. However, you must examine it
after making your choice, as with all eliminated cards, since some
cards have directions to follow when eliminated or forsaken.
```
#### MOVE

```
When you are directed to move a card, use the same rules and
restrictions as a move action).
```
#### REACTIVATE/ACTIVATE

#### (BATTLEGROUND OR PATH)

```
When you are directed to activate or reactivate a battleground,
or to activate a path, follow the rules given in the location step.
```
#### REMOVE

```
When you are directed to remove a card, you must immediately
eliminate that card no matter where it is: draw deck, cycle
pile, hand, or in play. If a card is removed from your draw deck,
reshuffle the deck.
```
#### RUNNING OUT OF CARDS

```
When your draw deck and cycle pile both run out of cards
because you draw all of them into your hand, continue playing
with the few cards you have remaining. If you completely run out
of cards (from your draw deck, cycle pile, and hand), there is no
penalty if you cannot eliminate a card when required.
```
#### TAKE FROM DRAW DECK

```
When you are directed to take a specific card from your draw
deck, secretly examine your draw deck and take the card, and
then reveal it to the other players so they can verify you took the
correct card. Afterwards, reshuffle your draw deck.
```
## SCORING

```
Scoring may vary for different scenarios, but in the Trilogy
scenario:
```
#### BATTLEGROUNDS

```
Each battleground in your team’s scoring area is worth the
number of victory points (VPs) printed at the top left of the card.
```
#### PATHS

- Each path in the Free Peoples team scoring area is worth the
    number of VPs printed at the top left of the card.
- The Shadow team earns VPs for paths based on how many
    corruption tokens resulted from the outcome of the path
    combat; the path itself is not worth any VPs for the Shadow.
    Place the path card facedown in your scoring area.

#### CORRUPTION TOKENS

```
Corruption tokens track the amount of corruption added
during the game. Whenever you add 1 corruption, place
1 corruption token in the Shadow scoring area.
```
```
Corruption tokens are usually added due to path combat, but may
also be added or removed as directed by card text.
If a card directs you to remove a corruption, but there are none to
remove, the directions are ignored.
Each corruption token is worth 1 VP for the Shadow team.
```
#### RING TOKENS

```
In the Trilogy scenario, each player’s unused Ring token is worth 1
victory point for the team. Ring tokens are only considered during
the final scoring, after combat on the last path is resolved.
```
## GLOSSARY

## THE GAME ROUND

## 1. LOCATION STEP

The starting player first activates 1 battleground, then activates
1 path.

If a card’s text directs you to reactivate a battleground, instead
of taking it from its battleground deck, take it from a scoring
area.Its activation text is resolved again and attackers and
defenders do not change.

Unless stated otherwise in the scenario rules, in the location
step of the first round, the starting player selects a random
path 1 card from among the three available. On subsequent
rounds, the path activated during the location step is selected
at random from among the path cards with a number one higher
than the last path activated in the prior round.

Only 1 path can be active at a time. If a card’s text activates a
path, the currently active path is replaced. However, before the
new path’s activation text is resolved, combat is immediately
resolved on the path being replaced (in the middle of the action
step). This combat is in addition to the path combat that will be
resolved during the combat step.

When a card allows you to activate a different path, you may
choose among the eligible paths (it is not chosen at random).

Unlike battlegrounds, a specific path cannot be activated more
than once per game. You cannot use a faction card’s text if
it would require you to activate a path that has already been
activated in this game.

#### RESOLVING COMBAT

Battleground combat is always resolved during the combat step.

Path combat is resolved:

a. During the action step whenever a new path is activated, and

b. During the combat step.

## 2. ACTION STEP

Players take turns taking actions, beginning with the starting
player and proceeding in the order specified in the scenario.

On your turn you may take 1 action, or may pass. Play continues
until all players have passed consecutively.

- Play 1 card from your hand.
- Move 1 character or army in reserve to an active path or
    battleground.
- Cycle 1 card from your hand.
- Winnow by eliminating 2 cards from your hand to draw 1 card.
- Use an action to resolve the text of a card in play indicating
    you may ‘use an action to...’
- Use a Ring token to draw cards.

Instead of taking an action, you may pass, but only when the
number of cards in your hand is less than or equal to your
carryover limit or the number of cards in your hand is less than
each enemy player.

You may pass on one turn and still take an action on your next,
provided the action step does not end before your next turn.

The carryover limit is the maximum number of cards a player
can have in hand at the end of the action step; at the start of the
game it is 2.

## 3. COMBAT STEP

## PATH COMBAT

```
On a path, the Free Peoples side is always the defender and the
Shadow is always the attacker.
```
1. Count the number of on Shadow cards and tokens.
2. Cancel a number of equal to the number of on the path
    itself, including any defense tokens on the path.
3. If there are any remaining , the Free Peoples player(s)
    must cancel as many as possible, eliminating their cards
    from the path until either the number of eliminated equals
    or exceeds the number of , or they run out of cards.
4. Any leftover Free Peoples cards on the path are cycled.

```
A Free Peoples character must be eliminated if it cancels even a
single (items with defense icons cannot cancel attack icons
separately from the character wielding them).
Finally, all Shadow characters in that combat are eliminated.
In the Trilogy scenario, if the Free Peoples can cancel out all the
, the Free Peoples place the path in their scoring area, where
it is worth the number of VPs printed on the path.
```
```
If the Free Peoples cannot cancel out all , the Shadow team
adds to the Shadow scoring area as many corruption tokens as
there are uncanceled , along with the path (facedown as a
reminder that its VP value does not apply.
```
## BATTLEGROUND COMBAT

```
On a battleground, one side is the defender and the other side
the attacker.
```
```
On a Shadow battleground, the Shadow side is always the
defender, and the Free Peoples side is the attacker; on a Free
Peoples battleground, the Free Peoples side is the defender and
the Shadow side is the attacker.
```
```
The attacking and defending factions of a battleground are fixed
by the battleground card, regardless of how it is activated.
```
```
If a battleground from one side’s battleground deck is reactivated
from the other side’s scoring area, the battleground’s are
ignored (they do not cancel out the attackers’ icons).
```
1. Count the number of on attacking cards.
2. Cancel a number of equal to the number of on the
    battleground itself, including any defense tokens added to
    the battleground ( or defense tokens on characters or
    armies are considered in the next step).
3. If there are any remaining , the defending player(s)
    must cancel as many of them as possible, eliminating their
    cards from the battleground until either the number of
    eliminated equals or exceeds the number of remaining
       , or they run out of cards.
4. Any leftover defending cards on the battleground are cycled.

```
A defending card must be eliminated if it cancels even 1 ,
regardless of how many it has.
```
```
At the end of battleground combat, all attacking cards are
eliminated. If the defenders cannot decide which characters or
armies to eliminate, the attackers can decide for them.
```
```
If the defender can cancel out all , the defender wins.
Otherwise, the attacker wins. The winning side takes control of
the battleground and places it in their scoring area.
```
## 4. VICTORY STEP

```
Each team calculates its score
```
## 5. DRAW STEP

## THE GAME ROUND

## 1. LOCATION STEP

```
The starting player first activates 1 battleground, then activates
1 path.
```
```
If a card’s text directs you to reactivate a battleground, instead
of taking it from its battleground deck, take it from a scoring
area.Its activation text is resolved again and attackers and
defenders do not change.
```
```
Unless stated otherwise in the scenario rules, in the location
step of the first round, the starting player selects a random
path 1 card from among the three available. On subsequent
rounds, the path activated during the location step is selected
at random from among the path cards with a number one higher
than the last path activated in the prior round.
```
```
Only 1 path can be active at a time. If a card’s text activates a
path, the currently active path is replaced. However, before the
new path’s activation text is resolved, combat is immediately
resolved on the path being replaced (in the middle of the action
step). This combat is in addition to the path combat that will be
resolved during the combat step.
```
```
When a card allows you to activate a different path, you may
choose among the eligible paths (it is not chosen at random).
```
```
Unlike battlegrounds, a specific path cannot be activated more
than once per game. You cannot use a faction card’s text if
it would require you to activate a path that has already been
activated in this game.
```

Finally, all Shadow characters in that combat are eliminated.
In the Trilogy scenario, if the Free Peoples can cancel out all the

If the Free Peoples cannot cancel out all , the Shadow team
adds to the Shadow scoring area as many corruption tokens as
there are uncanceled , along with the path (facedown as a

Shadow decks, and the other 2 each play one of the Free
Peoples decks. If there are 2 players, each player controls both
decks of your team.
