## Condensed Rules Summary
### Objective:
Command your fleet of Star Wars ships to defeat your opponent's fleet. Destroy all enemy ships or score the most points after 6 rounds.

### Setup:
1. Clear a 3' x 6' play area.
2. Each player chooses a faction (Rebels or Empire) and selects ships and squadrons.
3. Take turns placing obstacles in the middle of the table.
4. Players take turns placing their ships and squadrons on their side of the table.

### Game Round:
Each round has 4 phases:

1. Command Phase:
   - Secretly assign commands to each of your ships.

2. Ship Phase:
   - Take turns activating ships.
   - When activated, a ship can:
     a) Reveal its command
     b) Attack (up to twice)
     c) Move

3. Squadron Phase:
   - Activate squadrons not already activated.
   - Squadrons can either move OR attack.

4. Status Phase:
   - Reset defense tokens and prepare for next round.

### Basic Concepts:

1. Commands:
   - Navigate: Adjust ship's speed or turning.
   - Squadron: Activate nearby squadrons.
   - Repair: Fix damage to your ship.
   - Concentrate Fire: Improve your attack.

2. Attacking:
   - Roll dice shown on your ship's card.
   - Opponent can use defense tokens to reduce damage.
   - Deal damage to shields first, then to the ship itself.

3. Movement:
   - Use the movement tool to plot your course.
   - Speed determines how far you can move.

4. Squadrons:
   - Small fighter ships that move and attack separately.
   - Can engage enemy squadrons or attack larger ships.

### Winning:
- Destroy all enemy ships, OR
- Have the highest score after 6 rounds (points for destroyed enemy ships and objectives).

### Remember:
- Communicate with your opponent.
- Take your time to learn.
- Have fun commanding your Star Wars fleet!

## Factions/Civilizations
- Rebel Alliance: Generally faster and more maneuverable ships, strong fighter squadrons
- Galactic Empire: Typically larger, more powerful ships with strong frontal armament

Both factions have access to different ship types, squadrons, and upgrade cards, leading to distinct playstyles and strategies.


## Additional Notes
1. Learning curve: The game has a moderate learning curve due to its complex rules and tactical depth. New players should expect to spend time learning the mechanics before fully grasping strategy.

2. Expandability: Armada has numerous expansion packs available, allowing players to grow their fleets and add variety to their games over time.

3. Table space: The game requires a significant amount of table space (3' x 6' play area), which may be a consideration for some players.

4. Fleet building: A key aspect of the game is constructing balanced fleets within a point limit, similar to many miniature wargames. This adds a strategic layer before the game even begins.

5. Scenario play: The game includes various objective cards that change the victory conditions and add variety to each play session.

6. Simultaneous planning: The command dial system adds an element of simultaneous planning, as players must anticipate their needs several turns in advance.

1. Scalability: While designed for two players, the game can be played with larger groups using team rules, making it suitable for game nights with more participants.

# Star Wars: Armada - Rules

## PDF
[[Star Wars Armada.pdf]]
## SETUP

Clear a 3' x 6' **play area** and define a 3' x 4' **setup area** in the
center with the setup area markers. Each player sits at a long
edge with his ships, squadrons, and cards.

Set each **shield dial** and **squadron disk** to its maximum
appropriate values, and each squadron’s **activation slider** to
blue. Assign the appropriate **defense tokens** to each ship and
unique squadron. Take enough command dials and speed
dials for your fleet. Assign ID tokens to ships and squadrons
as necessary.

The player with the **lowest total fleet point cost** chooses the
**first player** (on a tie, flip a coin to decide who chooses). The
first player places the **initiative token** next to his edge, blue
side up.

The first player looks at all 3 of his opponent’s **objectives
cards** and chooses one to be the **objective** for the game.

Starting with the second player, players take turns choosing
and placing 6 **obstacles** into the setup area, beyond distance
3 of the play area edges and beyond distance 1 of each other.

Starting with the first player, players take turns deploying
forces. **A deployment turn consists of placing 1 ship or 2
squadrons**.

Your ships must be placed within your **deployment zone** :
within the setup area and at distance 1-3 of your edge. When
you place a ship, set its speed dial to a speed available on its
speed chart. Your squadrons must be placed within distance
1-2 of a friendly ship. If you have only 1 squadron remaining
when you must place 2, you cannot place it until you have
placed all of your ships.

Shuffle the **damage deck** and place it next to the play area
along with the **command tokens** , **maneuver tool** , **range ruler** ,
and the **round token** marked 1. Finally, remove the setup area
markers.

**During the first Command phase** , players must assign
command dials to their ships so that each ship has a number
of command dials equal to its COMMAND value.

## THE GAME ROUND

The game is played over 6 **rounds** , each made up of 4
**phases**. The first player retains initiative for the entire game.

### 1. COMMAND PHASE

On every round except the first, players secretly and
simultaneously choose a command on 1 command dial for
each of their ships. Then place each dial facedown next to
the ship’s ship card, _under_ any other dials already assigned
to that ship.

### 2. SHIP PHASE

Starting with the player with initiative, players take turns
choosing one of their ships and activating it by following
these steps:

#### 1. REVEAL COMMAND DIAL

**Reveal the top command dial** on your chosen ship’s stack of
dials and place it faceup next to the ship.

```
If you want to resolve the revealed command for its full effect
this round, you may spend the dial at the appropriate time
to do so.
```
```
If you want to reserve it for a later round, spend the dial by
placing it faceup on its ship card and place the matching
command token next to the ship.
You can spend both a command dial and a command token
to combine their effects, and you can resolve numerous
commands in the same round.
```
```
The maximum number of command tokens that a ship can
have is equal to its COMMAND value, and a ship cannot have
more than 1 of each type of command token. A token can be
spent in the same round it was gained.
```
## 2. ATTACK

```
The ship can perform up to 2 attacks. Each attack must
originate from a different hull zone, and the target must be
inside that hull zone’s firing arc.
The target of the attack can be either 1 hull zone of an enemy
ship or 1 or more enemy squadrons.
```
### 3. EXECUTE MANEUVER

```
The ship must execute a maneuver using the maneuver tool.
The distance moved corresponds to its current speed on its
speed dial.
```
**1. Determine Course**
Reset the maneuver tool so it is straight. Each column on the
ship’s **speed chart** corresponds to the speed number at the
bottom of the column. A column shows the number of times
each joint can be clicked while going at that speed.

```
Each row corresponds to a joint on the maneuver tool; the row
above the speed number relates to the first joint, the second
row relates to the second joint, etc. I means the joint can be
clicked once in either direction, II means it can be clicked
twice and - means it must remain straight.
```
```
You may place the maneuver tool on the table to determine
possible ship positions before committing to the move.
```
**2. Move Ship**
Place the maneuver tool on one side of your ship with the
plastic guides of its flat end sliding into the notches on the
side of the ship’s base. Ensure the front of the ship is parallel
with the raised line above the guides.

```
Pick up the ship and place it at the joint below the number
that corresponds to the ship’s current speed. The notches on
the ship’s base slide over that joint’s plastic guides.
The ship’s starting and final positions must be on the same
side of the tool. The tool cannot be placed so that the ship
overlaps the tool when placed in its final position (if so, place
the tool on the other side of the ship’s base before the move).
```
```
After a ship finishes its activation , place the revealed dial
faceup on its ship card to indicate the ship has activated.
```
```
The opposing player then activates one of his own unactivated
ships. A player who does not have any unactivated ships must
pass his turn. Repeat until both players have activated all of
their ships.
```
## 3. SQUADRON PHASE

```
Starting with the player with initiative, players take turns
activating any squadrons that were not activated by a
command during the Ship phase.
```
```
Each squadron that activates during this phase may either
move or attack , but not both.
```
```
Choose 1 of your unactivated squadrons and activate it. Then
you must activate a second unactivated squadron, if able.
```
```
When you activate a squadron, push its activation slider to
the other side.
```
```
Then your opponent activates 2 of his own squadrons in the
same way. Repeat until all squadrons are activated.
```
```
Squadron Movement
To move a squadron, place the range ruler on the table,
distance side faceup, with the distance 1 end of the ruler
in contact with any part of the squadron’s base. Then place
the squadron at any point along the ruler. It cannot be
placed with any portion of its base beyond the distance band
matching the squadron’s speed.
```
```
A squadron cannot be placed with any part of its base
overlapping another squadron or ship.
```
```
Squadron Attacks
A squadron can attack either 1 enemy squadron or 1 hull
zone of an enemy ship. Squadrons have a 360° firing arc; a
squadron can attack any target at distance 1.
```
```
Engagement
While a squadron’s starting or final position is at distance
1 of an enemy squadron, those squadrons are engaged. An
engaged squadron cannot move. When an engaged squadron
attacks, it must attack a squadron instead of attacking a ship.
```
```
If LOS between the squadrons is obstructed, they are not
engaged even if at distance 1 of each other, though they can
still attack each other.
```
## 4. STATUS PHASE

```
Players ready their exhausted defense tokens by flipping them
to their readied side.
```
```
The player with initiative flips the initiative token over. The
color and icon on the token matches that of unactivated
squadrons in the next round.
Reveal the round token with the next highest number to
indicate the round number for the next round.
```
## COMMANDS

## NAVIGATE

```
Spend this command dial to increase or decrease
the ship’s movement speed by 1. Also, it may
adjust 1 joint by 1 click more than the speed chart
normally allows.
The minimum speed for all ships is 0; the maximum
speed is shown on the speed chart.
```
```
A ship with a command token may spend the token when
determining its move to increase or decrease its speed by 1.
```
## SQUADRON

```
Spend this command dial to activate a number of
friendly squadrons at close-medium range up to the
ship’s SQUADRON value. Each activated squadron
can attack and move in either order. Choose and
activate squadrons one at a time.
```
```
A ship with a command token may spend the token after
revealing its command dial to activate 1 squadron as above.
```
## REPAIR

```
Spend this command dial to gain engineering points
equal to the ship’s ENGINEERING value. It may
spend these points as follows in any combination
and number:
```
```
1 pt: Move 1 shield from one of the ship’s hull
zones to another of its hull zones (without exceeding
the hull zone’s maximum shield value).
2 pts: Recover 1 shield in any of the ship’s hull
zones.
3 pts: Discard any 1 of the ship’s faceup or
facedown damage cards.
```
```
Engineering points do not persist from round to round.
```
```
A ship with a command token may spend the token after
revealing its command dial to gain engineering points equal
to half of its ENGINEERING value, rounded up, to spend on
the above effects.
```
## CONCENTRATE FIRE

```
Spend this command dial to roll 1 additional attack
die after the ship rolls dice during an attack. The
die must be of a color that it already rolled.
A ship with a command token may spend the token after
it rolls dice during an attack to reroll 1 attack die.
```
## ATTACKING

**1. Declare Target** Choose 1 of your ship’s hull zones to attack
from, then declare the defending hull zone on the target ship
(it must be within the zone’s firing arc and in range).
**2. Roll Attack Dice** Determine your **attack dice** , as shown on
the attacking hull zone and allowed by the range, then roll
them.
**3. Resolve Attack Effects** Resolve effects that modify the
dice. For each **accuracy** icon rolled, you may choose 1 of
the defender’s **defense tokens** ; the chosen token cannot be
spent during this attack.
**4. Spend Defense Tokens** The defender can spend 1 or more
of his defense tokens.
**5. Resolve Damage** The attacker can resolve 1 of its critical
effects. The defender then suffers damage equal to the
number of hit and critical icons remaining.

```
For each hit rolled, the defender suffers 1 damage. For
each critical rolled, if the attacker and defender are both
ships , the defender suffers 1 damage and the first damage
card dealt is dealt faceup.
```
```
Firing Arc and Range
To measure a hull zone’s firing arc , use the range ruler
to extend the zone’s firing arc lines on the ship token. If
a portion of the target is inside the area between those
extended firing arc lines, the target is inside the firing arc.
```
```
Use the range side of the range ruler to determine the range
to the target. Measure between the closest points of the
appropriate hull zone(s) or squadron base(s). Each range
band shows which colors of attack dice you can roll.
```
```
Line of Sight (LOS)
An attacking ship or squadron must trace LOS to its target.
When tracing LOS to or from a squadron , trace the line
using the point on the squadron’s base that is closest to the
opposing squadron or hull zone.
```

**When tracing LOS to or from a hull zone** , trace the line using
the yellow targeting point in that hull zone.

If LOS is traced through any hull zone on the defending ship
that is not the defending hull zone, the attacker does not
have LOS and he must declare another target. If there is no
valid target, he cannot perform an attack.

If LOS is traced through obstacles or ships that are not the
attacker or defender, the attack is obstructed. If LOS is drawn
over an obstacle, the attack is obstructed even if the bases of
the attacker and defender are touching.

Squadrons do not block or obstruct LOS, and the attacker’s
hull zones do not block his LOS.

**When an attack is obstructed, the attacker rolls 1 less die of
his choice**.

**Defense Tokens**

```
Redirect: Choose 1 of your hull zones adjacent to the
defending hull zone. Any amount of damage may be
suffered on the chosen zone’s remaining shields before
the remaining damage must be suffered on the
defending hull zone.
```
```
Evade: If the attack occurs at long range, the defender
chooses and cancels 1 attack die. At medium range,
choose 1 attack die to be rerolled. At close range and
distance 1, the token has no effect.
Brace: After damage is totaled, reduce the total to
half, rounded up.
```
```
Scatter: Cancel all attack dice.
Contain: Prevent the attacker from resolving the
standard critical effect. The attacker can still resolve
a non-standard critical effect (eg Upgrade card).
```
When you spend a readied defense token, flip it over to its
**exhausted** (red) side. When you spend an exhausted defense
token, return it to the supply. All exhausted defense tokens
are readied during the Status phase.

You cannot spend any single defense token more than once
per attack, and you cannot spend more than 1 defense token
of each type per attack. **If your speed is 0, you cannot spend
any defense tokens**.

**Ship Damage**
Suffer each point of damage separately by reducing the
**shields** in the defending hull zone by 1 (rotate the shield dial
to the next lowest number).

If you do not have any shields remaining, instead draw 1
card from the damage deck and place it facedown near your
ship card.

If a ship ever has a number of damage cards equal to its **hull
value** , it is **destroyed**. Remove the model and any associated
components.

A ship or squadron is destroyed if a portion of its base is
outside the play area.

**Critical Effect**
Before the defender determines the total damage amount
from an attack, the attacker can resolve a **critical effect**. If
the attacker rolled at least 1 critical , the first damage
card that the defender receives is dealt faceup.

The attacker can resolve only 1 critical effect per attack.

Faceup damage cards count as damage against the ship’s hull
and also inflict the effect on the card. They remain faceup
until an effect flips them facedown or discards them.

```
Attacking Squadrons with a Ship
A ship attacking a squadron can perform 1 attack against
each squadron inside the firing arc and at attack range of the
attacking hull zone. Each attack is resolved separately.
```
```
Squadron Attacks
Squadrons do not declare an attacking hull zone. The
attack dice a squadron uses when attacking ships are
shown on its squadron card.
An attacking squadron can target 1 enemy squadron or ship
hull zone at distance 1 using the distance side of the range
ruler. Squadrons have a firing arc of 360º. They can use all
dice colors, but they ignore icons when attacking.
```
```
Squadron Defense
Attacking a squadron follows the same rules for attacking a
ship, but the attacker does not declare a defending hull zone.
```
```
When attacking a squadron, the attacker uses the
anti-squadron section of his card to determine his
attack dice (this is the same for all hull zones).
```
```
Squadron Damage
When a squadron suffers damage, reduce its remaining hull
points by the damage amount by rotating the squadron’s disk
so that the pointer points to the remaining hull points.
```
```
If a squadron ever has 0 or fewer hull points, it is destroyed.
Remove the model and any associated components.
```
```
Squadrons suffer damage equal to the number of hits
only; they ignore criticals.
```
## OVERLAPPING

```
Squadrons cannot be placed to overlap other ships or
squadrons. Ships and squadrons can move through other
ships and squadrons without issue.
```
```
If a moving ship’s final position overlaps 1 or more squadrons,
the ship finishes its movement normally and any overlapped
squadrons are moved out of the way.
```
```
The player who is not moving the ship places all of the
overlapped squadrons, regardless of who owns them, next to
the ship so their bases are touching the ship’s base.
If a moving ship’s final position would overlap another ship,
it cannot finish its movement normally. Instead, its speed
is temporarily reduced by 1 and it attempts to move at this
speed.
```
```
This process continues until the moving ship can finish a
movement or until its speed is temporarily reduced to 0, in
which case it remains in its current position.
```
```
After moving, the moving ship and the closest ship that it
overlapped both receive 1 facedown damage card.
```
## OBSTACLES

```
Ships and squadrons can move through obstacles without
issue; only the final position of the ship or squadron matters.
If a ship overlaps more than 1 obstacle, resolve the effects
in any order.
```
```
Asteroid Field
A ship that overlaps this obstacle receives 1 faceup damage
card. Squadrons are unaffected.
```
```
Debris Field
A ship that overlaps this obstacle suffers 2 damage on any
hull zone. Squadrons are unaffected.
```
```
Station
A ship that overlaps this obstacle may discard 1 of its faceup
or facedown damage cards. A squadron that overlaps this
obstacle may recover 1 hull point.
```
## FLEET-BUILDING

```
The number in the lower right corner of ship, squadron, or
upgrade card is its fleet point cost.
```
```
You cannot field more than 1 card that has the same unique
name (identified by a bullet • to the left of the name).
```
```
Build a standard fleet by choosing any number of ship,
squadron, and upgrade cards with a combined fleet point
cost not exceeding 300 fleet points, and without any
foreknowledge of your opponent’s fleet.
```
```
Squadrons of the same type share a single squadron card.
The cost is for 1 squadron of that type. A unique squadron
uses its own squadron card instead of the shared card for that
type, and you can field only 1 copy of each unique squadron.
Unique squadrons use the reverse side of the squadron disk
of their type (with the portrait on the unique squadron card).
```
## FLEET RESTRICTIONS

```
A fleet must be either Rebel-aligned or Imperial-aligned, and
cannot contain any ships, squadrons, or upgrades that are
aligned with the opposing faction.
A fleet must have 1 and only 1 flagship (a ship equipped with
a commander card). Assign a flagship ID token pair of the
appropriate faction to the flagship.
```
```
A fleet cannot spend more than one third of its fleet points
on squadrons.
```
```
A fleet must include 3 objective cards, one from each category.
```
## UPGRADE CARDS

```
For each icon shown in on a ship’s upgrade bar at the bottom
of its ship card, the ship can equip 1 upgrade card with the
matching icon. Upgrade cards can be used by ships of any
faction unless they have a faction symbol next to the card’s
cost. A card with a Rebel symbol can only be equipped in
a Rebel fleet, and one with an Imperial symbol can only be
equipped in an Imperial fleet.
```
```
A ship cannot equip more than 1 upgrade with the
Modification trait.
```
```
A title card can only be equipped to a ship with the matching
ship icon. A ship cannot equip more than 1 title card.
```
```
A ship with a commander card equipped is a flagship. Any
ship can equip a commander card regardless of the icons on
its upgrade bar, but it cannot equip more than one.
```
```
Upgrade card effects may indicate a specific time when they
occur. Effects that modify attack dice may be resolved after the
attack dice are rolled. Effects with the icon of a command may
resolve while the ship is resolving the matching command.
```
```
Critical effects on upgrade cards are indicated by the :
header. The attacker must have at least 1 in his attack
pool, and can resolve only 1 critical effect per attack. If a
color is specified the icon must be on a die of that color.
```
```
The standard critical effect is:
: If the defender is dealt at least 1 damage card by this
attack, deal the first damage card faceup.
```
```
Squadrons cannot resolve or suffer critical effects unless
otherwise specified.
```
```
To exhaust a readied card, rotate it 90° clockwise; while
exhausted it cannot be exhausted again. During the Status
phase, all upgrade cards are readied by rotating them 90°
counterclockwise.
```
## OBJECTIVES

```
There are 3 categories of objectives: assault (red), defense
(yellow), and navigation (blue).
```
```
When a ship is chosen as an objective ship, indicate this by
placing an objective token next to its ship card.
```
```
If an objective allows you to collect victory tokens , at the end
of the game each victory token is worth the fleet point value
listed in the lower right corner of the objective card.
```
## WINNING THE GAME

```
The game immediately ends when all of one player’s ships are
destroyed. That player is eliminated, and his opponent wins.
```
```
If neither player is eliminated after 6 rounds, the game ends
and the player with the highest score wins. Your score is
equal to the total cost of each enemy ship (including upgrade
card costs) and squadron that was destroyed, plus the fleet
point value of any victory tokens you collected.
If both players have the same score after 6 rounds, the
second player wins the game.
```
## OPTIONAL RULES

```
Unlimited Rounds
The game does not end after the sixth round; instead, the
game ends only when all of one player’s ships are destroyed.
Do not use objectives, but place obstacles as normal.
```
```
In addition, at the end of each round, the player with
initiative gives initiative to his opponent by passing the
initiative token to that player.
```
```
Team Play
Split the players as equally as possible into 2 teams. Each
team controls 1 fleet, and must also nominate a Team
Commander from among its members.
```
```
Each player takes exclusive control of 1 or more of his
team’s ship and squadron cards and makes all decisions for
the corresponding ships and squadrons; including choosing
commands, attacking, spending tokens, etc.
During the Command Phase, each player chooses commands
for only the ships that he controls. He may discuss his
choices with his teammates, but he must do so openly at the
table and cannot show his command dials to another player.
```
```
During the Ship Phase, the players must agree on which ship
to activate when it is their turn to activate a ship.
```
```
During the Squadron Phase, the team must agree on which
squadrons to activate.
```
```
If teammates cannot come to an agreement on a choice, the
Team Commander makes the final decision.
```
```
If all of one player’s ships and squadrons are destroyed, his
team continues to play and can win by destroying all of the
opposing team’s ships or by having the highest score after
6 rounds.
```

## THE GAME ROUND

### 1. COMMAND PHASE

Players secretly choose a command for each of
their ships, placing the command dial facedown
next to the ship card, _under_ any other dials
already assigned to that ship.

### 2. SHIP PHASE

Starting with the player with initiative, take turns
activating one ship.

#### 1. REVEAL COMMAND DIAL

Reveal the ship’s top command dial. If you want to
resolve the command for its full effect this round,
spend the dial at the appropriate time.

If you want to reserve it for a later round, spend
the dial and place the matching **command token**
next to the ship.

The maximum number of command tokens a ship
can have is equal to its **command value** , and a
ship cannot have more than 1 of each type.

#### 2. ATTACK

The ship can perform up to 2 attacks, each from
a different hull zone. The target of the attack can
be either 1 hull zone of an enemy ship or one or
more enemy squadrons.

#### 3. EXECUTE MANEUVER

The ship must execute a maneuver at its current
speed as shown on its speed dial. Set the
maneuver tool according to the restrictions on the
ship’s speed chart and move the ship.

### 3. SQUADRON PHASE

Starting with the player with initiative, players
take turns activating any squadrons not activated
by a command during the Ship phase.

**Each squadron that activates during this phase
may either move** **_or_** **attack** , but not both.

Choose one of your unactivated squadrons and
activate it. Then you must activate a second
unactivated squadron, if able. When you activate
a squadron, push its activation slider.

```
A squadron may move up to its speed along the
distance side of the range ruler.
```
```
A squadron can attack, at distance 1, either 1
enemy squadron or 1 hull zone of an enemy ship.
```
```
While a squadron is at distance 1 of an enemy
squadron, those squadrons are engaged. They
cannot move; and when they attack, they must
attack a squadron instead of attacking a ship.
```
### 4. STATUS PHASE

```
Flip exhausted defense tokens to their readied
side. Flip the initiative token over. Display the
round token with the next highest number.
```
## COMMANDS

### NAVIGATE

```
Increase or decrease ship’s speed by 1.
May also adjust one joint by one click more than
the speed chart normally allows.
```
```
Token: Spend when moving to increase or
decrease speed by 1.
```
### SQUADRON

```
Activate a number of friendly squadrons
at close-medium range up to the ship’s squadron
value. Each squadron activated can attack and
move in either order.
```
```
Token: Spend after revealing the ship’s
command dial to activate 1 squadron as above.
```
### REPAIR

```
Gain engineering points equal to the ship’s
engineering value. The ship may spend these
points on the following effects:
1 pt: Move 1 shield from 1 hull zone to another
hull zones.
2 pts: Recover 1 shield in any hull zone.
3 pts: Discard any 1 faceup/down damage card.
```
```
Token: Spend after revealing the ship’s
command dial to gain EPs equal to half its
engineering value, rounded up.
```
### CONCENTRATE FIRE

```
Roll 1 additional attack die after the ship
rolls dice during an attack. The die must be of a
color that it already rolled.
```
```
Token: Spend after the ship rolls attack dice
to reroll 1 die.
```
## THE GAME ROUND

### 1. COMMAND PHASE

```
Players secretly choose a command for each of
their ships, placing the command dial facedown
next to the ship card, under any other dials
already assigned to that ship.
```
### 2. SHIP PHASE

```
Starting with the player with initiative, take turns
activating one ship.
```
#### 1. REVEAL COMMAND DIAL

```
Reveal the ship’s top command dial. If you want to
resolve the command for its full effect this round,
spend the dial at the appropriate time.

### 3. SQUADRON PHASE

```
Starting with the player with initiative, players
take turns activating any squadrons not activated
by a command during the Ship phase.
```
```
Each squadron that activates during this phase
may either move or attack , but not both.

Choose one of your unactivated squadrons and
activate it. Then you must activate a second
unactivated squadron, if able. When you activate
a squadron, push its activation slider.
```
```
A squadron may move up to its speed along the
distance side of the range ruler.
```
```
A squadron can attack, at distance 1, either 1
enemy squadron or 1 hull zone of an enemy ship.
```
```
While a squadron is at distance 1 of an enemy

rolls dice during an attack. The die must be of a
color that it already rolled.
```
```
Token: Spend after the ship rolls attack dice
to reroll 1 die.
```

### ATTACKING

**1. Declare target** Choose one of your ship’s hull
zones to attack from, then declare the target ship’s
defending hull zone (within firing arc and range).
**2. Roll attack dice** Roll your **attack dice** (printed
in the attacking hull zone).
**3. Resolve attack effects** For each **accuracy**
icon rolled, choose 1 of the defender’s **defense
tokens** ; that token cannot be spent this attack.
**4. Spend defense tokens** The defender can spend
1 or more defense tokens to negate damage.
**5. Resolve damage** For each hit , the defender
suffers 1 damage. For each critical , **if
the attacker and defender are both ships** , the
defender suffers 1 damage and the first damage
card dealt is dealt faceup.

```
Range & LOS Use the range side of the range
ruler to determine the range to the chosen hull
zone. Each range band on the ruler shows which
colors of attack dice you can roll.
```
```
If LOS is traced through obstacles or ships that
are not the attacker or defender, the attack is
obstructed: attacker rolls 1 less die of his choice.
```
```
Squadron Attacks
Squadrons do not need to declare an attacking
hull zone, and can target one enemy ship at
distance 1 using the distance side of the range
ruler. Squadrons can use all dice colors at
distance 1, but ignore icons when attacking.
```
```
Defense Tokens
If speed is 0, you cannot spend defense tokens.
```
```
Redirect: Choose a hull zones adjacent to
the defending hull zone. Any amount of
damage may be suffered on the chosen zone’s
remaining shields before the rest of the damage is
suffered on the defending hull zone.
```
```
Evade: Long range attack: choose and
cancel 1 attack die. Medium range: choose
1 attack die to be rerolled. Close range and
distance 1: no effect.
```
```
Brace: After damage is totaled, reduce the
total to half, rounded up.
```
```
Scatter: Cancel all attack dice.
Contain: Prevent attacker from resolving
the standard critical effect (he can still
resolve a non-standard critical effect).
```
```
When you spend a readied defense token, flip it
over to its red exhausted side. When you spend an
exhausted defense token, return it to the supply.
```
```
Ship Damage Reduce the shields in the
defending hull zone by 1.
If you have no shields remaining, instead draw 1
card from the damage deck and place it facedown
near your ship card.
```
```
If a ship ever has a number of damage cards
equal to its hull value , it is destroyed.
```
```
Critical Effect Before the defender determines
the total damage, the attacker can resolve a
critical effect. The attacker must have rolled at
least 1 critical. The attacker can resolve only
1 critical per attack.
The standard critical effect is: If the defender is
dealt at least 1 damage card by this attack, deal
the first damage card faceup.
Faceup damage cards count as damage against
the ship’s hull and also inflict their effect.
```
```
Squadron Defense The attacker does not need to
declare a defending hull zone.
When attacking a squadron, the attacker uses the
anti-squadron section of his card to determine his
attack dice, which is the same for all hull zones.
```
```
Squadron Damage When a squadron suffers
damage, reduce its remaining hull points by the
damage amount. If a squadron ever has 0 or fewer
hull points, it is destroyed.
Squadrons suffer damage equal to the number of
hits only; they ignore criticals.
```
```
Attacking Squadrons with a Ship When a ship
attacks a squadron, it can perform 1 attack
against each squadron inside the firing arc and
at attack range of the attacking hull zone. Each
attack is resolved separately.
```
## OBSTACLES

```
Asteroid Field: Ships overlapping receive 1 faceup
damage card. Squadrons are unaffected.
Debris Field: Ships overlapping suffer 2 damage
on any hull zone. Squadrons are unaffected.
```
```
Station: Ships overlapping may discard 1 faceup
or facedown damage cards. A squadron that
overlaps this obstacle may recover 1 hull point.
Ships and squadrons can move through obstacles;
only the final position matters.
```
## ATTACKING

**1. Declare target** Choose one of your ship’s hull
zones to attack from, then declare the target ship’s
