# Descent Legends of the Dark (3e) - Rules
[[Descent 3e Legends of the Dark.pdf]]

BLOOD AND FLAME

Terrinoth is in peril. The barony of Kell has already fallen, and the demon-tainted barbarians of the Uthuk Y’llan stalk the realm. In the Mistlands, the undead servants of Waiqar the Undying stir, venturing beyond their borders for the first time in memory. The Council of Barons cannot agree on which enemy is the graver threat, let alone on a course of action.

And in the northern barony of Forthyn, the stage is set for the next great confrontation between Terrinoth and the forces of darkness…

Overview
Descent: Legends of the Dark is a cooperative game for one to four players. The players assume the roles of heroes who
oppose evil throughout an expansive campaign, improving their abilities, slaying foes, exploring Terrinoth, and forging their own legend. Each quest is part of the Blood and Flame campaign, during which the heroes attempt to complete a series of objectives before succumbing to either their injuries or the enemy’s plans.

As the heroes explore forbidden dungeons, dark forests, and ancient battlegrounds, they attempt to thwart the schemes of evil and gather power and experience. The heroes’ path is
plagued with dificult choices that, by the end of the campaign, may transform the fate of Terrinoth.

The App
To play this game, one player must download the free Descent: Legends of the Dark app on a compatible device. The app tracks and controls the enemies, map layout, hero inventory, and
campaign progression, leaving the players free
to focus on their heroes and the story they are	App Store
experiencing. The app also allows the players	Icon to save their campaign to complete it over the
course of many gaming sessions.

To download the app, search for Descent: Legends of the Dark on the Amazon™ Appstore, Apple iOS App Store™, Google Play™, or Steam®.

Assembly
Before playing for the first time, assemble the plastic figures, health dials, and terrain pieces following the instructions on the Component Assembly insert that is included in the game box.

This section contains the fundamental concepts for Descent: Legends in the Dark that provide context for players who are about to learn how to play the game.

herOes
During a game, each player controls a hero that is represented by a hero card and a plastic figure. Each hero’s plastic figure indicates that hero’s position on the game map, and each hero card contains information about that hero, including their stats and unique abilities.

Each hero has two weapons that are represented by a pair of weapon cards. Each weapon has a standard side, which heroes use at the start of the campaign, and an upgraded side that heroes can unlock as the campaign progresses. The upgraded side has an upgrade icon () after “Weapon” in the lower-left corner.

Syrus’s Hero Card and Figure

Both of a hero’s weapon cards are stacked together and placed into a single card sleeve. This pair of sleeved weapon cards function as a single, double-sided attack card. During the game, a hero can flip their attack card to use the weapon on the other side.


Only four heroes are available at the beginning of the campaign, but more heroes become available as the campaign progresses. Between games, players can choose to control different heroes, and for many quests, the app specifies heroes that players must control.




THE HEROES

The following four heroes are available at the start of the campaign:

•   Brynn, the human avenger, leads the charge against her foes and stands ready to defend against their reprisal.

•   Galaden, the elf huntsman, is adaptable and focused, able to deliver damage wherever it is needed.

•   Syrus, the human prodigy, uses magic to manipulate his attacks and enemies with help from his phoenix.

•   Vaerix, the dragon-hybrid outcast, heals the party and lashes out at their foes with draconic wrath.

The following two heroes become available as the campaign progresses:

•   Chance, the hyrrinx rogue, uses stealth and high mobility to attack from unexpected directions and slink away unharmed.

•   Kehli, the dwarf artificer, is a bold and curious hero who crafts unique inventions to help herself and her allies.







Galaden’s starting attack card is created so that the upgraded () sides of his two weapon cards are hidden.


Flipping cArds
During the game, a hero can flip their hero card, skill cards, and their attack card, which is made up of two weapon cards as described above.

Flipping a card changes the abilities and weapons that are available for a hero to use. Additionally, flipping a card removes all tokens that are on that card, which includes conditions and fatigue, all of which is described later.

During the game, players are challenged to eficiently manage their cards, making sure each one is flipped to the side they wish to use for a given situation.

The App
The Descent: Legends in the Dark app guides the players through their campaign by providing narratives and objectives, revealing maps and enemies, and determining when heroes win or lose a quest. The app also saves their campaign progress and inventory.

The app has two primary screens: one that displays the map that the heroes are exploring and another that displays all of the enemies that are currently in play.

enemies
Enemies are the various monsters and villains that the heroes encounter during the game. Each enemy on the map is represented by a figure, and information about that enemy is tracked by the app.

When an enemy spawns, the app creates an enemy bar, assigns that enemy a color that is used to distinguish it from other enemies of the same type, and shows where that enemy is placed on the map.

Before an enemy figure is placed on the map, players must insert an ID marker of the assigned color into that figure’s base. ID markers also have notches for colorblind players (see “Colorblind Players” below).










Map Screen




This enemy bar’s color is orange, so an orange ID marker is inserted into the enemy figure’s base.









Enemy Overview Screen

Players can toggle between each of these screens by selecting the buttons in the upper-right corner. The current screen’s button is highlighted.

COLORBLIND PLAYERS

The side of each ID marker has one to four notches. If players cannot distinguish an enemy by its color, they should make sure that the number of notches that are exposed on the ID marker match the number of notches depicted on that enemy’s bar in the app.

This enemy’s bar and ID marker both display three notches.



Toggle Buttons for Map Screen (left) and Enemy Overview Screen (right)

Both of these screens have numerous game functions that are described later.

seTup
To set up a campaign of Descent: Legends of the Dark, follow the steps presented in this section.

1.	Launch App: Players launch the Descent: Legends of the Dark app and select “New Game.” The app guides players through a series of screens to create a save slot, select a dificulty seting, and choose starting characters.

Other than selecting a save slot, none of these choices are permanent. Players can adjust the dificulty seting at any time, and they can play different characters over the course of the campaign.

Single Player: If playing a single-player game, the player chooses and controls two heroes, but all other rules remain the same.






2.	Gather Hero Components: Each player takes a reference card, a health dial, the plastic figure and hero card that match the hero they chose in the app, and that hero’s two starting weapon cards, as follows:

Galaden’s Hero Card, Figure, Health Dial, and Starting Weapons



Each player combines their starting weapons by placing one weapon on top of the other. The faces that have the upgrade () icon should face each other so they are not visible (see “Weapon and Attack Cards” on page 4). Then, the pair of cards is inserted into a card sleeve and treated as a single attack card during the game.

Then, each player sets up a play area in front of them where they place their gathered components. A hero can begin the game with either side of their hero card and attack card faceup.

Learn to Play	7
plAying A QuesT
A single game of Descent: Legends of the Dark represents one quest that is played over a series of rounds, and each round consists of two phases that players resolve in the following order:

1.	Hero Phase: During this phase, the heroes can move around the map, attack enemies, and interact with their environment.

2.	Darkness Phase: During this phase, the app resolves the effects of time, enemies, and the quest.

After resolving the darkness phase, a new round begins, starting with the hero phase. Players continue to resolve game rounds in this manner until the quest ends.


mAneuver
The maneuver action allows a hero to move around the map. When a hero performs a maneuver action, they gain a number of movement points equal to their speed.

Brynn
The Human Avenger	3	Speed
10



A hero can spend one movement point to move into an adjacent space. Map tiles are divided into spaces, and two spaces are adjacent if they share a border or corner.


herO phAse
During the hero phase, the heroes choose the order in which they take their turns. This order can change from round to round. After all heroes have taken a turn, they select the “End Phase” button to proceed to the darkness phase.








During their turn, each hero may perform up to three actions in any order: one maneuver action and two additional actions of their choice. A hero can perform the same action multiple times. For example, Brynn could perform a fight action followed by two maneuver actions.

The five actions a hero can choose from are as follows:

•   Maneuver


The hero’s space is adjacent to the eight highlighted spaces.


A hero cannot move into a space that contains an enemy or a piece of 3D terrain, but they can move into a space that
contains another hero if they can immediately move out of that space.



•   Fight

•   Explore

•   Ready

•   Unique


A hero can perform actions between spending movement points.

After a hero ends their turn, any movement points that they did not spend are lost. Unspent movement points do not carry over to a future turn.



Each of these actions is described in more detail over the next several pages.


Impeded
A hero is impeded if they are adjacent to an enemy. When a hero becomes impeded, they lose all movement points. When an impeded hero would gain more than one movement point, they gain only one instead.











8	Learn to Play
Sight Tokens
Sight tokens represent points of interest. As heroes approach them, they can expand the map,
reveal new details, or trigger traps.	Sight Token

When a hero moves into or adjacent to a space that contains a sight token, they must activate the sight token immediately.
To do so, they select and drag from their hero’s portrait to that sight token in the app. This does not use an action.
If an effect causes this movement to occur during the darkness phase, the hero resolves that sight token at the start of the next round.







Brynn moved adjacent to this sight token, so she must activate it before she continues her turn.



MOVEMENT EXAMPLE

Brynn wants to move adjacent to the nearby treasure chest so she can search it. Brynn performs a maneuver action. Her speed is “3,” so she gains three movement points.

1.	Brynn spends her first movement point to move to the right.

2.	She spends her second movement point to move diagonally into Syrus’s space.

3.	She spends her third movement point to move to the right and immediately exit Syrus’s space. She needs to move farther, so she performs another maneuver action, gaining three more movement points.

4.	She spends her fourth movement point to move adjacent to the chest. For her final action of the round, she performs an explore action to search the chest.

5.	She spends her fifth movement point to move adjacent to the cauldron and ends her turn, forfeiting her last movement point.

IMPEDED MOVEMENT EXAMPLE

After exploring the chest on her previous turn, Brynn wants to attack the wight. Brynn performs a maneuver action and gains three movement points.





23



1.	She spends one movement point to move adjacent to the wight.
This causes her to become impeded, so she loses all of her remaining movement points.

2.	She uses her second action to attack the wight (see “Fight” on page 10) but she does not defeat it, so she is still impeded.

3.	She uses her last action for another maneuver action. Since she is still impeded, she gains only one movement point. She uses it to move away from the wight.

FighT
The fight action allows a hero to attack an enemy in an attempt to defeat it and remove it from the map. An example of a hero’s attack is on page 12.

The weapon that is faceup on a hero’s attack card is the weapon that a hero uses during an attack. When a hero attacks, they must choose and attack an enemy figure that is within range and in line of sight of their hero figure.

Range
Range is used to determine if an enemy is within striking distance of a hero’s weapon. For all weapons, an enemy is within range of a hero if it is adjacent to that hero. For weapons that have the “Reach” keyword, an enemy is within range if it is adjacent or two spaces away from that hero.

If a hero is using a weapon that has a range value, the attack is a ranged attack. Heroes can perform ranged attacks against adjacent or non-adjacent enemies.

true aim crossBoW Crossbow.


Line of Sight
Line of sight refers to what a figure can see. To determine line of sight, a hero traces an imaginary line from the center of a figure’s space to the center of another figure’s space. If the line is interrupted by map edges or spaces that contain blocking terrain, line of sight is blocked. The pieces of blocking terrain are shown on page 22.

The corners of spaces do not block line of sight. Also, figures do not block line of sight.

A figure cannot attack another figure if line of sight between them is blocked.

To determine range, the hero counts the number of spaces between their space and the enemy’s space along the shortest path of adjacent spaces. The hero starts in a space that is adjacent to them and ends in the enemy’s space. If that number is equal to or less than the weapon’s range, the enemy is within range.

Line of sight from the hero to enemy 2 is blocked by a tree, but it is not blocked to enemies 1 and 3.


LINE OF SIGHT TOOL

If a player is struggling to determine line of sight, they can select “Line of Sight” in the options menu. Then, the player selects any space in the app—this causes the app to highlight all of the spaces that are within line of sight of the selected space. The app
Options Menu
also displays range from that space: red spaces are adjacent, orange spaces are two spaces away, and yellow spaces are three or more spaces away.

Galaden is adjacent to the enemy on the right, so he can attack it with any weapon. The enemy on the left is three spaces away, so Galaden needs a weapon that has a range value of at least “3” to attack it.
The selected space has unblocked line of sight to the highlighted spaces, but not to the spaces behind the door.

Hero Attacks
When a hero attacks an enemy, they use the app to select and drag from their hero’s portrait to the image of the enemy that they are attacking.


For each success, the enemy suffers damage (), which is automatically subtracted from its health. The amount of damage that the enemy suffers for each success is determined by the damage value of the weapon the hero used.

Enemy Defense and Abilities
Each enemy has a defense value displayed next to its health bar. Each time an enemy is attacked, the damage that it suffers is reduced by an amount between zero and its defense value. This is automatically calculated by the app.



To attack the green bandit, Syrus drags from his portrait to that bandit’s image.

This opens the hero attack screen, where the hero indicates the weapon they are using (their faceup weapon) by selecting it in the app. Then, they roll the die that is displayed next to the attack icon on their hero card.

Attack Icon



When the bandit is attacked, the app reduces the damage it suffers by a number between zero and two.


Most enemies also have a defense ability that the heroes resolve when the enemy is attacked.



Galaden rolls one blue die during his attack.


Typically, the hero wants as many success () results as possible to damage the enemy. The hero can resolve each die icon as follows:

•   Success (): The hero can spend each success to apply damage to the enemy.

•   Advantage (): The hero can place fatigue to convert one advantage () result to one success () result for each fatigue that is placed. Fatigue is described on page 18.

•   Surge (): The hero can spend surge () results to resolve surge abilities. Surge abilities provide heroes with various effects and are described on page 20.

For each success () result the hero spends to apply damage, they select the “>” button to input that success into the app. After the hero has input the total number of successes, they select “Confirm.”


Damage Types
Each weapon has one or more damage types shown on the left side of the card. Most enemies
are weak to some damage types. During a hero’s	CRUSH attack, each success spent causes one additional
damage for each of the weapon’s damage types	Crush that the enemy is weak to. This is calculated by       Damage Type the app.

The damage types that an enemy is weak to are displayed as “?” until the weakness is discovered. The first time an enemy suffers damage of a type that they are weak to, that weakness is revealed for the duration of the campaign.




This enemy is weak to weapons that have the anemos damage type. Their other weakness is unknown.

The app calculates the result of the attack. Each success for “Glimmering Wand” does two damage. Since “Glimmering Wand” has the slash () damage type— which the enemy is weak to—the enemy suffers one extra damage for each success, raising the total to six damage.

2  +  1  +  2  +  1  =  6

3.	In the app, Syrus selects and drags from his hero portrait to enemy 2’s figure to start the attack.

7.	The enemy has a defense value of “2,” so the damage is randomly reduced by up to two. In this case, the damage is reduced by one, so the enemy suffers five damage, leaving it with 22 health.










8.	The zealot's defense ability is also resolved. The app selects a random enemy, and when that enemy attacks next, the app will add two damage.

explOre
The explore action allows a hero to search the environment and affect the tokens and 3D terrain on the map, which can progress and alter a quest’s narrative and provide the heroes with unique choices and experiences.

reAdy
The ready action allows a hero to flip one card in their play area. This lets the hero change their hero ability or weapon to something more useful for their current circumstances.

When a hero performs the ready action, they can flip their hero card, their attack card, or one of their skill cards. Skills are described on page 28.

When a hero flips a card for any reason, they discard all tokens on that card. This is a great way for the hero to remove the hindering effects of fatigue tokens and some conditions.


Explore Token	3D Terrain Piece


When a hero performs the explore action, they interact with a piece of 3D terrain or an explore token. That component must be adjacent to or in the same space as the hero’s figure. To interact, the player selects and drags from their hero’s portrait to the component they are interacting with and follows the instructions that the app provides.

Many cards have abilities that are prefaced with an action () icon. The number preceding the action icon indicates how many actions the hero uses to perform the unique action.




Brynn explores the chest by dragging from her portrait to the chest.

Interacting with 3D terrain and tokens can produce a variety of effects such as performing tests, gaining items, and expanding the map, all of which is described later.

A hero can select any 3D terrain piece or token by tapping on it in the app. This allows a hero to review information about that terrain piece or token without performing an action.

dArkness phAse
The darkness phase represents the passage of time, during which foes and other elements of the quest attempt to thwart the heroes’ goals. The app guides players through the darkness phase, but the steps are briefly described here:

winning And lOsing
Each quest has its own objectives that are displayed at the top of the screen.



1.	Time Passes: Heroes suffer the effects of the “infected” and “terrified” conditions, which are described on page 20. Also, each hero can discard one fatigue; fatigue is described on page 18.

2.	Enemy Activation: The app activates each enemy on the map, one at a time, causing them to move and attack. Enemy activations are described on page 15.

3.	 Quest: The app may display messages about new events, place enemies on the map, update the heroes’ objectives, and more.

4.	Tactics: Some enemies may plan to execute a powerful or cunning tactic for the next round. If they do, the app displays a message that hints at the enemy’s intent.


If the heroes complete the final objective of a quest, the heroes win and the quest ends.

If the final objective cannot be completed, or if any hero who has a major injury is wounded again, the heroes lose and the quest ends. Wounded heroes and injuries are described on page 18.

When a quest ends, the heroes progress to the next quest. However, the outcome of the quest—whether the heroes won or lost—may affect future quests and other aspects of the campaign.

AcTivATing enemies
During the darkness phase, each enemy takes a turn activating. When an enemy activates, it typically moves toward a specific hero and attacks them.

The order in which the enemies activate is determined by the app. When it is an enemy’s turn to activate, the app opens an activation screen that displays the picture and name of that enemy as well as other information the enemy uses for its activation.












Enemy Activation Screen

TArgeTing
Each enemy wants to attack a hero during its activation. That hero is the enemy’s target and is displayed on its activation screen. When activating, the enemy moves so it is positioned to resolve an attack against that target if possible.

If the enemy cannot attack the displayed target, the hero who is closest to the enemy becomes the target instead. If there are multiple heroes who are the closest, the hero among them with the least health becomes the target, and if there are multiple closest heroes who have the least health, the heroes choose the target of the attack from among the eligible options.

If an enemy cannot attack any hero during its activation, that enemy moves toward the closest hero who has the least health.


mOving The first thing an enemy does during its
activation is move. When an enemy is activated, it gains movement points equal to its speed. If
the enemy is impeded, it gains only one                          Enemy movement point instead.                                                     Speed

Then, that enemy spends movement points to move to a space on the map where it can attack its target. An enemy that does not have a range
value moves adjacent to its target. However, if              Enemy an enemy does have a range value, it moves so it          Range
is a number of spaces away from its target equal
to that range value, or as close to equal as possible. This may mean that the enemy moves away from its target if it is too close, or toward the target if it is too far away.

An enemy cannot move into a space that contains a hero or a piece of 3D terrain, but they can move into a space that
contains another enemy if they immediately move out of that space.

rAnge And line OF sighT
An enemy that can attack from range must have line of sight to its target from the space it moves to. If an enemy does not have line of sight to its target from any space that is a number of spaces away from its target equal to its range, that enemy moves to a space that is as far from its target as possible while remaining within range and in line of sight.

Line of sight and range are determined using the same rules described in the “Fight” section on page 10.

impeding
Similarly to heroes, an enemy becomes impeded if it begins its activation in a space that is adjacent to a hero or if it moves into a space that is adjacent to a hero.

Enemies prefer not to become impeded if possible. However, this preference is the final consideration after all other movement criteria are satisfied.

•   Advantage (): The hero can place fatigue to convert one advantage () result to one success () result for each fatigue that is placed. Fatigue is described on page 18.

•   Surge (): The hero can spend surge () results to resolve surge abilities. Surge abilities provide heroes with various effects and are described on page 20.

When a hero selects the “Interrupt” button, the enemy activation screen closes, giving heroes access to the game’s main screens. When the heroes are ready to resume an enemy’s activation, they select the “Resume Activation” button.



After reducing damage, the hero suffers all remaining damage. To suffer damage, the hero rotates their health dial to decrease their health by the amount of damage suffered. The effects of being reduced to zero health are described on page 18.








Galaden suffers four damage.

THE HEROIC ADVENTURE RULE

During enemy activations, the players should move and use enemy abilities in a way that best accomplishes the enemy’s instructions and avoids the enemy becoming impeded if possible. Otherwise, players are not required to make the enemies move in a way that optimally opposes the heroes.

2.	The zealot is not impeded, so it gains three movement points. Since the zealot has a range of “3,” it wants to be exactly three spaces away from Brynn. Of the spaces
that are three spaces away from Brynn, the zealot moves to the space with the green checkmark, where it has unblocked line of sight to Brynn and does not become impeded.

4.	The zealot’s attack does five damage. Brynn’s one success reduces that damage to four. Brynn suffers four damage, rotating her health dial to reflect her current health.

current health. When a hero heals (), they increase their health, but they cannot have more than their maximum health.
9
After a hero suffers one or more damage (),	Maximum Health they decrease their health by that amount. If
on Hero Card
a hero’s health is reduced to zero, they are
wounded. When a hero is wounded, they set their health dial to their maximum health and select their portrait in the app to view their hero information screen. Then, they select the “Wound Hero” button and follow the instructions that the app provides.





If the hero is instructed to suffer an injury, they do so as follows:


FATigue ()
Fatigue is the result of a hero exerting additional effort during their quest. This effort can help a hero succeed at a crucial moment, but the fatigue they accumulate can hinder them if they do not manage it carefully.

cOnverTing AdvAnTAge When a hero rolls dice during an attack, defense, or test, they can convert advantage
() results to success () results by placing fatigue tokens on their cards. For each fatigue
token that is placed, the hero converts one	Fatigue Token advantage result to a success result. The hero
can place each fatigue token on any of their cards that has a fatigue limit in the lower-right corner of the card. The fatigue limit indicates the maximum number of fatigue tokens that can be on that card.

FATigue AbiliTies
If an ability is prefaced with a number and the fatigue () icon, it is a fatigue ability. To resolve a fatigue ability, a hero must place the number of fatigue tokens specified by the ability, and these tokens can only be placed on the card that has the ability. If the number of tokens that would be on the card exceeds its fatigue limit, that ability cannot be resolved.



•   Minor Injury: The hero suffers a minor injury by taking the minor injury card specified by the app and placing it in their play area with the “Minor” side faceup. The hero reads the card’s effect and follows its instructions.


If an “X” precedes the fatigue () icon, the hero may place any number of fatigue on the card as long as they do not exceed its fatigue limit.



•   Major Injury: The hero suffers a major injury by flipping their injury card so the “Major” side is faceup. The hero reads the card’s effect and follows its instructions.

Fatigue Ability


2 : During an enemy’s activation, if it is adjacent to you, become the target.
During your defense, add 1 .



If a hero with a major injury is wounded, the app typically informs the heroes that they have failed and the quest ends.

Major Injury Card


To use this ability, the hero must place two fatigue tokens on this card. The card’s fatigue limit is “3,” so the ability cannot be used if there are already two or more fatigue tokens on it.




enemy dAmAge And deFeAT
When an enemy suffers damage from an attack, the app applies that damage automatically. If a hero’s ability directly damages an enemy, the hero selects that enemy in the enemy overview screen and manually reduces the enemy’s health using the “<” button.

If an enemy’s health ever reaches zero, that enemy is defeated, and their figure is removed from the game map.

suFFering FATigue
Additionally, some game effects may require a hero to “suffer” fatigue. Unless specified otherwise, when a hero suffers fatigue, they must place the specified number of fatigue tokens on any of their cards that has a fatigue limit without exceeding that limit. This fatigue can be spread across multiple cards. When suffering fatigue, for each fatigue token that a hero cannot place on a card, they suffer one damage instead.





Direct Damage Input on Enemy Information Screen


18	Learn to Play
TesTs
When heroes interact with terrain and tokens on the map, they often are instructed to perform a test. Each test requires a hero to use one of the stats that is displayed on their hero card: might, agility, insight, or will. Each stat can have a positive (+) or negative (–) modifier that is applied to all tests of that stat.

When a hero is instructed to perform a test of a specific stat, they roll two black dice. Then, they apply the modifier to the number of successes they rolled.


Might     +2  Agility     -1  insight      -1  Will         +1 


Brynn tests will and rolls five successes. She applies her will modifier, resulting in a final total of six successes.
1

The total number of successes after modifiers are applied determines the outcome. There are two types of test:

•   Some tests require the hero to input the number of successes in the app. Then, the app provides the outcome of the test. The successes for some of these tests are
cumulative—the heroes can perform the test multiple times, and the app tracks the total number of successes.


While performing a test, the hero can spend surge () icons to resolve surge abilities and can place fatigue to convert advantage () results to success () results.













This hero tested might and rolled three successes.


negATing
The app may grant a hero the chance to negate damage or fatigue before they suffer it. When this occurs, the hero is presented with a stat to test (e.g., “Each hero suffers 4 damage; might negates.”). Before suffering the damage or fatigue,
the hero may test the indicated stat, and each success () produced during that test prevents one damage or fatigue.


•   Some tests provide a number that indicates how many successes are required to pass the test (e.g., “Test might 6”). If the hero has successes equal to or greater than the required number, they pass the test. Otherwise, they fail the test. After the hero selects “Pass” or
“Fail” as appropriate, the app provides the hero with the outcome.

•   Reach: A weapon with this keyword can be used to attack a figure that is up to two spaces away (if line of sight is not blocked).



AbiliTies
Most of the cards in a hero’s play area have abilities. Each ability describes when and how it is resolved.

When a hero resolves an ability, it cannot affect other heroes unless the ability specifies otherwise. For example, if an ability reads “1 : Focus 1 card,” the hero resolving that ability cannot place a focus token on another hero’s card.

surge AbiliTies
A surge ability is any ability that is prefaced by a surge () icon. Many cards have surge abilities, including all hero cards. A hero can use their surge abilities any time they roll a die. To use a surge ability, a hero spends a surge icon from one of their die results and then resolves the ability’s effect. Each surge ability can be used only once per roll.

Add 1 , and any hero may
discard 1 condition.

rerOlling dice
Some abilities allow heroes to reroll dice. Reroll abilities must be used before any die results are resolved. If a hero has multiple reroll abilities, they can reroll multiple dice or reroll any dice multiple times, using their rerolls as they choose.

CONSUMABLE          COMMON
cannot be used again during that quest.	Consumable Card

keywOrds
Heroes and enemies use abilities that are presented as keywords. A keyword is a shorthand for an effect that appears frequently. The rules for each keyword are as follows:

•   Reveal: After a card is flipped (which includes when it is placed in a hero’s play area at the start of a quest), if the faceup side of that card has the “Reveal” keyword, the effect that follows the keyword must be resolved immediately.

•   Shift: This keyword allows a figure to move up to the number of spaces specified. When a figure is moved in this way, it ignores the rules of impeding, but it still obeys all terrain rules.

herO cOndiTiOns
Hero conditions are positive and negative effects represented by condition tokens that are placed on cards. If an effect instructs a hero to “infect,” “terrify,” “scar,” “focus,” or “prepare” a card, that hero places a condition token of the appropriate type on that card. For example, if a hero is instructed to “focus” their hero card, they gain a focus token and place it on their hero card.

If a card is not specified, the hero can place the token on their hero card, attack card, or any of their skill cards.

When a card would gain a condition but already has a token of that type, the card cannot gain that condition. Resolving the “charge” keyword is an exception to this rule.

When a hero flips a card, all tokens on that card are returned to the supply.

Each condition has a unique effect, as follows:

Infected: When time passes during the darkness phase, the hero suffers damage equal to the number of infection tokens on their cards.

Terrified: When time passes during the darkness phase, the hero suffers one fatigue on each of their cards that has a terrify token on it.

Scarred: When a hero flips a card that has a scar token on it, that hero suffers two damage.



•   Charge: After a card is flipped (which includes when it is placed in a hero’s play area at the start of a quest), if the faceup side of that card has the “Charge” keyword, the type and number of tokens specified by the keyword are placed on the card. When there are no tokens of that type on that card, that card is flipped.

For example, if a hero flips a card and the ability on the faceup side reads, “Charge: Prepare 2,” the hero places two prepare tokens on that card. When the hero spends the last of that card’s prepare tokens, the hero immediately flips that card.

Focused: During an attack, defense, or test, a hero may discard a focus token from a card to reroll one of their dice.

Prepared: During their turn, a hero may discard a prepare token from one of their cards to flip that card without performing a ready action.

smAll And lArge enemies
Enemy figures that occupy one space are small. Enemy figures that occupy more than one space are large. When a large enemy moves, the heroes choose one space that is adjacent
to a space that the large enemy occupies. Then, they move the enemy so that any part of its base occupies the chosen space. All other movement rules apply.

When determining line of sight for large enemies, a path can be traced to and from the center of any space that the large enemy occupies. Additionally, when determining range to or from a large enemy, heroes can count from any space that the large enemy occupies.



Each enemy has a level that indicates the strength of that particular figure. The enemy’s level is displayed in the app on the enemy screen. Higher-level enemies have more health and defense, and they have stronger attacks and abilities.

Enemy statuses are resolved automatically by the app and are removed by the app at the end of each round. An enemy cannot suffer a status that it already has.

The app resolves each status as follows, and all percentage calculations are rounded up.

RISER

The riser is used to prevent a large enemy from tilting on a staircase. If a large enemy figure ends its movement so that it hangs over a staircase step (or over the two spaces in front of that staircase), place the riser under the unsupported part of the figure.


•   Aflicted: During the darkness phase, each aflicted enemy suffers four damage.

•   Dazed: When a hero attacks a dazed enemy, the secondary abilities on the hero’s weapon are 10% more likely to be used (secondary abilities are explained on page 27).

•   Doomed: At the end of the round, a doomed enemy’s “Doomed” status is removed, but all of its other statuses remain on the enemy for another round.

•   Enfeebled: An enfeebled enemy’s attack damage is reduced by 20%.

•   Exposed: An exposed enemy suffers 20% more damage from attacks.

An archway is a piece of terrain that consists of two pillars and an arch. The spaces that are occupied by an archway’s pillars prevent movement and block line of sight. Figures can move into and trace line of sight through the two spaces between the pillars.


















Heroes and enemies can move and attack through the two spaces under the arch.

If a figure is too tall or too wide to fit underneath an archway, players should remove the archway until the figure is no longer positioned underneath it. It may be helpful to place a pillar or token on the spaces occupied by the archway’s pillars to remind players that they cannot move or trace line of sight through those spaces.

Some terrain is printed on sheets that are placed partially under map tiles. When placing this terrain, it is important that only the spaces shown in the app are exposed.



















Water Underlay under a Map Tile

The spaces on underlays are adjacent to spaces that they share a border or corner with, and heroes and enemies can move into underlay spaces normally. Each type of underlay has unique effects for both heroes and enemies, as follows:

Embers: If a hero moves into an ember space, they scar one of their cards. If an enemy moves into an ember space, the enemy becomes aflicted and doomed.

Poison: If a hero moves into a poison space, they infect one of their cards. If an enemy moves into a poison space, the enemy becomes enfeebled.


Spikes: If a hero or enemy moves into a spike space, they become impeded and suffer two damage.

Each pillar can attach to a map tile in two ways, either using a notch that depicts a gargoyle or a notch that does not depict a gargoyle. When constructing any elevated portion of the map, reference the app to ensure that the pillars are oriented the same way that the app displays.


dOwnwArd mOvemenT
In addition to using staircases, heroes and enemies can move downward any number of levels by moving off a tile edge. For the purposes of downward movement, any spaces that would be adjacent to each other if the map tiles of all levels were flattened are treated as adjacent. The best way for players to assess this is by looking at the map from overhead.







Gargoyle on Pillar


The app instructs the player to insert this tile as shown, with the gargoyle head side gripping the tile.

Starting from the tile on the table, each level of elevation is higher than the previous level by approximately the height of one staircase (or the distance to the next notch on a pillar).


Level 3


Level 2


Level 1





The highlighted spaces are lower than the hero’s space, and the hero can move to any of them.

elevATiOn And ATTAcks
Heroes and enemies can trace line of sight and determine range up and down elevation as if all levels were flattened. As such, heroes and enemies can attack each other from above or below.


sTAircAses
Figures cannot move directly upward an entire level (i.e., from a level-1 map tile to a level-2 map tile). Instead, they must use a staircase. Each staircase has three steps.

The bottom and middle steps are between the levels bridged by the staircase, so a figure can move from the lower level's map tile to those steps, or from those steps to the higher level's tile.

The top step is at the same level as the higher level's map tile (even if that tile is resting on the top step). Thus, a figure cannot move directly to the top step from the lower level's map tile.








To measure line of sight and range to this enemy, the hero treats themself as being at the same elevation as the enemy.

OverhAngs
An overhang is a portion of a tile that exists one or more levels directly above a tile that is below it. Both heroes and enemies can move into a space that is underneath an overhang. However, if a figure is too large to fit under an overhang—that is, if the figure cannot stand normally without touching the tile above it—that figure cannot move or be moved into that space.


OverhAngs And line OF sighT Overhangs may or may not block line of sight between two figures. Generally, a figure can trace line of sight to another figure that is under an overhang if the line traces through
a space on the lower figure’s level that does not have an overhang above it. Players are encouraged to use the line of sight tool in the app. For detailed rules and examples of line of sight with overhangs, players can consult the in-app Rules Reference.


OverhAngs And rAnge
When determining range between two spaces on different levels, heroes count range through adjacent spaces as normal (see “Range” on page 10). When counting range, heroes can count up and down levels. For detailed rules about range with overhangs, players can consult the in-app Rules Reference.

Because some effects do not require line of sight, it is possible for a figure or space to be in range of effects whose origin is directly above or beneath them.

Syrus stands under an overhang.

Vaerix has line of sight to the enemy on the right, and he can attack it using a weapon that has a range of “6” or greater. Vaerix cannot attack the enemy on the left because line of sight is blocked; however, that enemy can be affected by abilities that target enemies that are within three spaces of Vaerix.

cAmpAign rules
The rules presented in this section are not necessary to begin playing the game. When the heroes gain access to the
campaign map in the app, they should read the rules presented in this section and continue the campaign.

Early in the campaign, the heroes gain access to additional features in the app. This includes the opportunity to craft items, upgrade equipment, and acquire skill cards. These opportunities are available in the city of Frostgate, where the heroes return after most quests.

The weapons and items that the heroes use throughout their campaign are referred to as equipment. Each hero begins the game with two weapons, and as the campaign progresses, the heroes can find and craft different weapons in addition to armor, trinkets, and consumables.

The heroes are collectively referred to as a party, and the equipment that the party has access to is tracked in the app. The amount of equipment that the heroes can have in their inventory is limitless; however, before embarking on a quest, each hero chooses a finite number of weapons and items to equip, as follows:

Armor Restrictions
Each armor card indicates whether it is light, medium, or heavy armor. A hero cannot equip any armor type that is not presented on their hero card.

•   Two weapons (creating one attack card)	Light or Medium Armor	ARMOR	MEDIUM

•   One armor	Armor Type on Hero Card (left) and Armor Card (right)

All equipment cards are double-sided with one side showing the standard version of the equipment and one side showing its upgraded version. Each hero places their chosen equipment in their play area with the standard side faceup. If the equipment has been upgraded, they place it with the upgraded side faceup instead. The rules for upgrading equipment are described in “Crafting and Upgrading” on page 27.


TrinkeTs A trinket provides effects to the hero who has it equipped. The app manages the effects of all equipped trinkets automatically; however, when a hero equips a trinket, they still place that trinket’s card in their play area as a reminder of its effect.

Consumable Card

When crafting, the heroes can create batches of consumables, which allow heroes to choose those consumables for all future quests. A hero cannot equip multiple copies of the same consumable.

There are three types of consumables:

crAFTing And upgrAding Throughout the campaign heroes gain the following resources: gold, materials, essences, and recipes. All of these resources are shared among the heroes and are tracked by the app. The heroes can use these resources between quests to craft new equipment and upgrade existing equipment.

gOld
Gold is the primary currency of Terrinoth. When the heroes visit the city of Frostgate, they can spend gold to purchase materials used for crafting. Some quests and events also provide opportunities to spend gold.



•   Common: There are four copies of each common consumable.

•   Limited: There are two copies of each limited consumable. These can be used only by specific heroes, who are listed on the card.

•   Unique: There is one copy of each unique consumable. These are powerful brews that can only be found during quests.

weApOn pArTs


mATeriAls And essences
The primary resources that heroes need to craft and upgrade equipment are materials and essences. Materials are a common resource that heroes can either find through exploration or purchase in the city using gold. These include metal, bone, leather, cloth, minerals, herbs, and curios. Essences are rare and represent the components that make up the fabric of reality, such as ignos (fire) and anemos (air).



Weapons are made up of three parts. The first part dictates which card the hero uses. The other two provide the weapon with secondary abilities.

Many of these abilities have a percent chance of occurring each time the hero attacks; they are calculated and resolved by the app automatically. Other abilities that may affect heroes or the map display additional reminder text at the appropriate time.

First Weapon Part


TrAiTs






recipes
Throughout the campaign, the heroes gain recipes. Each recipe provides a hero with a list of materials and essences needed to craft a specific piece of equipment. To craft that equipment, the hero combines the listed materials with the recipe in the crafthall, which the heroes can visit between quests. After crafting a piece of equipment, the recipe and the materials that were combined with it are spent and automatically removed from the party’s inventory. Any equipment that is crafted becomes part of the party’s inventory for the remainder of the campaign, including consumables.



Many cards contain traits such as “Leadership” or “Spear” that are presented below their card name. Traits have no inherent effects; however, other game effects may refer to cards that have those traits.

If an effect is referencing a card with a trait, it is only referencing the faceup side of that card.


There are two recipes for each piece of equipment. The first recipe that is used crafts the equipment and it becomes available for the heroes to use during quests.
The second recipe that is used upgrades the equipment, which allows the heroes to use the upgraded version.

The ciTy screen
Frostgate is one of the Free Cities of the kingdom of Terrinoth. While not subject to the barony of Forthyn, it exists within its borders and is both an ally and rival.













City Screen

The city is home to the heroes during the campaign, and they return to it between quests. They can visit various locations to buy materials and craft equipment, as well as gather information from the residents of the bustling metropolis.

The city has three featured locations that the heroes can visit:

Crafthall
An important way that the heroes can gain power throughout the campaign is to craft and upgrade equipment. The crafthall allows heroes to spend the recipes, materials, and essences they have gained to craft and upgrade equipment.

Armory
The armory allows the heroes to modify the parts of their weapons so they can optimize for their upcoming quest, explore new strategies, and customize to their play style.

Shop
The shop contains materials, recipes, and sometimes equipment that can be purchased for gold. Additionally, materials can be sold for gold.


FeATs
Each hero has unique feats that they can complete to progress their personal growth. A hero's feats are tracked by the app, which indicates their progress and notifies them when a feat is completed. After a feat is completed, the hero claims the reward shown, such as a new skill or an exclusive recipe, and selects a new feat.












skills And experience
As heroes progress through the campaign, they automatically unlock skills and gain experience (xp), both of which are tracked by the app. Skills provide a hero with abilities that are resolved as described on the skill cards. At the start of each quest, heroes choose which skills to equip. The combined cost of a hero’s equipped skills cannot excede the hero’s experience.

A hero can equip unlocked skills that depict that hero’s image in the lower-left corner.

Similar to hero cards, skill cards are double-sided, have fatigue limits, and can be flipped during play.


evenTs
Events can appear in the city and on the campaign map and represent a variety of locations, people, and occurrences. To resolve an event, the heroes select the event in the app and follow the instructions. Some events require the heroes to travel to a particular destination. Events advance the narrative and provide the heroes with rewards and other surprises.

Regular: This type of event can appear in the city and on the campaign map. Heroes can resolve the event by selecting it.

Travel: This type of event can appear on the campaign map. Heroes can travel to that event and resolve it by selecting it.

virTues
Each hero has two attributes that represent their primary virtues. These are unique, hero-specific attributes that the app uses to track a hero’s narrative choices.

During the story, heroes make choices that may increase their virtues. Virtues have no inherent effects, but the app uses them to determine exclusive outcomes and choices for a hero.

Note that increasing both attributes is just as viable and useful to the app as focusing on a single attribute, so players can make their choices based on the story, gameplay, or how they would like their hero to grow.

prepAring
After a quest is selected, each player must choose a hero for that quest. Players may choose a different arrangement of heroes each time they play, but many quests indicate a required hero.


Brynn’s portrait has a lock icon, which means she is required for the “The Treasure of Davin Throm” quest.

After selecting their heroes, each player chooses their weapons and trinket in the Hero Loadout screen. They also choose their armor, consumables, and skills for the upcoming quest, following the restrictions described in the previous sections. Then, they select “Embark” and the quest begins.


cAmpAign mAp
The campaign map displays the barony of Forthyn and a glimpse into the regions beyond its borders. While in the city, the heroes can access the campaign map by selecting the City Exit button. The campaign map allows the heroes to view quests and events that are available to them.







City Exit Button






The hero loadout screen allows heroes to view and equip their weapons and trinkets.







Campaign Map Screen

QuesTs
Quests on the campaign map are indicated by a quest icon. The heroes can select a quest to view a short description about it:

Campaign Quests: These quests progress the campaign’s story whether the heroes win or lose. These quests often focus on a specific hero.

Side Quests: These quests are optional but offer additional rewards and story. Each side quest can be attempted once, and then is removed from the map.

When the heroes are ready to play another quest, they choose a quest from the map and select the “Prepare” button.

sAving A cAmpAign
Players can save their campaign at any time by selecting “Save & Quit” from the options menu. If players choose to save their game during a quest, it is important that the heroes record the location of all figures on the map as well as the arrangement of their play areas—this includes the types and orientation (what is faceup/facedown) of cards, the placement of tokens, and their current health.

cOnTinuing A cAmpAign
To continue a campaign, the players select the “Load Game” button on the app’s title screen. Then, they select the appropriate save slot for the campaign that is being continued.

Players can set up the supply by following step four of “Setup” on page 7. After players select their heroes, they gather
their hero components and set their health dials. Then, they select their next quest in the app and select “Embark.”

clAriFicATiOns

This section clarifies some common language and rules. Entries are organized alphabetically by topic. The Rules Reference in the app provides comprehensive details for all rules, including the clarifications presented here.


herO Turns
•   A hero can still spend movement points and use abilities after performing all of their actions. The hero’s turn does not end until they declare it has ended.



cArd lAnguAge
•   When an ability refers to a “roll,” it refers to any situation in which a hero rolls one or more dice, such as when attacking, defending, or performing a test.

•   If a component moves “toward” another component, each space that the moving component moves into must reduce the distance between both components.

•   If a component moves “away” from another component, each space that the moving component moves into must increase the distance between both components.

•   If an ability uses the word “consecutive,” it is referring to
a series of contiguous spaces in which the next space in the series is adjacent to the previous space.

•   If an ability instructs a hero to “swap” two components, each component is placed where the other component was previously.

•   If an ability uses the word “collectively,” that ability affects the party as a whole instead of an individual hero. The party must decide how the effect is divided among the heroes.

cOndiTiOns
•   If a hero has a choice of where to place a condition token, they cannot place it on a card that already has that type of token on it.

•   When a hero flips a card, all tokens that are on that card are discarded, even condition tokens that provide positive effects.


sTAircAses
•   Some maps are constructed with a map tile resting on the top step of a staircase. The spaces resting on the top step are treated as part of that step.

The App
•   Heroes can tap on objects in the app to view more information about them. Doing so does not use a hero’s action. When a hero selects their portrait and drags to an object in the app, they are using an action.

iming
T
•   Each ability describes when it can be used. Most commonly, abilities can be used “before,” “after,” or “during” a specific time or action of the game, as follows:

◊   If the timing of an ability uses the word “before” or “after,” the ability’s effect can be resolved immediately before or after the described timing event.

◊   If the timing of an ability uses the word “during,” the ability’s effect can be resolved any time during the described timing event.

•   Each ability can only be used once during its described timing. For example, an ability that can be used “During your turn” can be used once during each turn, but it cannot be used twice during the same turn.


GOLDEN RULES



FATigue
•   A card that has a fatigue limit of “0” can have fatigue placed on it if an ability increases that card’s fatigue limit.

heAlTh
•   A hero cannot heal above their maximum health.

•   If a hero suffers an amount of damage that would reduce their health below zero, that damage reduces their health to zero instead.


The golden rules are the fundamental concepts on which all other game rules are built.

•   If information in the Rules Reference contradicts the Learn to Play booklet, the Rules Reference takes precedence.

•   If a card ability directly contradicts information in the Rules Reference, the card takes precedence. If both the card and the rules can be followed at the same time, they should be.


•   If a card ability uses the word “cannot,” it is absolute and cannot be overridden by other abilities.

•   If an ability in the app directly contradicts information in the rulebooks or on cards, the app ability takes precedence.

Quick reFerence

rOund sTrucTure
Each game round consists of the following two phases:

1.	Hero Phase: During this phase, each hero takes a turn performing actions to move, attack enemies, and interact with tokens and terrain.

2.	Darkness Phase: During this phase, time passes and enemies activate.

AcTiOns
During a hero’s turn, they can perform one maneuver action and two additional actions. A hero can perform the same action multiple times (including multiple maneuver actions).

herO cOndiTiOns
Infected: When time passes during the darkness phase, the hero suffers damage equal to the number of infection tokens on their cards.

Terrified: When time passes during the darkness phase, the hero suffers one fatigue on each of their cards that has a terrify token on it. (As normal, the hero suffers one damage for each fatigue token that cannot be placed in this way.)

Scarred: When a hero flips a card that has a scar token on it, that hero suffers two damage.




•   Maneuver: The hero gains movement points equal to their speed.

•   Fight: The hero attacks an enemy.

•   Explore: The hero interacts with an explore token or piece of 3D terrain.

•   Ready: The hero flips one of their cards.

•   Unique: The hero resolves any ability that is prefaced by the action () icon.

Focused: During an attack, defense, or test, a hero may discard a focus token from a card to reroll one of their dice.

Prepared: During their turn, a hero may discard a prepare token from one of their cards to flip that card without performing a ready action.

underlAys
Underlays have the following effects for heroes and enemies:






 Success

 Advantage

 Surge


icOns
 Unique Action

 Upgrade

 Health

Embers: If a hero moves into an ember space, they scar one of their cards. If an enemy moves into an ember space, the enemy becomes aflicted and doomed.

Poison: If a hero moves into a poison space, they infect one of their cards. If an enemy moves into a poison space, the enemy becomes enfeebled.



 Fatigue	 Damage

keywOrds
•   Charge: After a card is flipped (which includes when it is placed in a hero’s play area at the start of a quest), if the faceup side of that card has the “Charge” keyword, the type and number of tokens specified by the keyword are placed on the card. When there are no tokens of that type on that card, that card is flipped.

•   Reach: A weapon with this keyword can be used to attack a figure that is up to two spaces away (if line of sight is not blocked).

•   Reveal: After a card is flipped (which includes when it is placed in a hero’s play area at the start of a quest), if the faceup side of that card has the “Reveal” keyword, the effect that follows the keyword must be resolved immediately.

•   Shift: This keyword allows a figure to move up to the number of spaces specified. When a figure is moved in this way, it ignores the rules of impeding, but it still obeys all terrain rules.


Spikes: If a hero or enemy moves into a spike space, they become impeded and suffer two damage.

Water: When spending movement points to move out of a water space, a hero or enemy must spend one additional movement point.

FreQuenTly OverlOOked rules
•   A hero can perform actions between spending movement points.

•   A hero can perform the same action multiple times during their turn.

•   When placing fatigue to resolve a fatigue ability, that fatigue must be placed on the card where that ability is printed.

•   When placing fatigue to convert an advantage to a success, that fatigue can be placed on any of that hero’s cards that have a fatigue limit.

•   When a hero flips a card, all tokens that are on that card are discarded, even tokens that provide positive effects.

Abilities
An ability is a game effect that appears as text either on a card or in the app. Each game ability describes when it can be used and how it is resolved. To resolve an ability, read its text and follow the instructions.

» A hero can only resolve abilities on their own cards.
» Each ability can only be resolved once for each of that ability's timing instances.
· For example, if an ability's timing reads, 'During your attack,' that ability can only be resolved once during that attack. » When a player resolves an ability, they must resolve the ability in its entirety.
· If a player cannot resolve all of an ability, they resolve as much of the ability as they can.
» If a card ability directly contradicts information in this rules reference, the card takes precedence. · If both the card and the rules can be followed at the same time, they should be.
» If an ability in the app directly contradicts information in the rulebook or on cards, the app ability takes precedence. » If a card ability uses the word 'cannot,' it is absolute and cannot be overridden by other abilities.

Timing
Typically, abilities are resolved 'before,' 'after,' or 'during' a described timing event (i.e., an attack, defense, test, or roll). » If an ability occurs 'before' a timing event, the player can resolve that ability immediately before resolving that event. » If an ability occurs 'after' a timing event, the player can resolve that ability immediately after resolving that event.
» If an ability occurs 'during' a timing event, the player can resolve that ability any time during that event if another game effect is not being resolved.
» Each ability can only be resolved once for each of that ability's timing instances.
· For example, if an ability's timing reads, 'During your attack,' that ability can only be resolved once during that attack.

Types
There are many unique types of abilities found throughout the game.

Enemy Activation Abilities
Enemy Activation Abilities: Each enemy has an ability that can modify the rules of its activation. During an enemy's activation, that enemy's ability is displayed on the enemy activation screen.
» When an enemy activates, the party reads that enemy's abilities and applies its effect to the activation as instructed.

Enemy Defense Abilities
Enemy Defense Abilities: Each enemy has a defense ability that can modify the effects of a hero's attack. During a hero's attack, an enemy's defense ability is displayed on the hero attack screen.
» When a hero is attacking an enemy, they read that enemy's ability and applies its effect to the attack as instructed.
· Some defense abilities are applied by the app automatically.

Fatigue Abilities
Cards in a hero's play area may contain fatigue abilities. A fatigue ability is any ability that is prefaced with afatigue (  ) icon and a number. That number indicates the amount of fatigue a hero must place to resolve that ability.
» Before resolving a fatigue ability's effect, a hero must place the required number of fatigue tokens on the card that has that fatigue ability.
· The number of fatigue tokens a hero must place on that card is equal to the number that prefaces the fatigue ability.
· For example, if an ability is prefaced by '2  ', that hero must place two fatigue tokens on the card that has that ability.
· The number of fatigue tokens on that card cannot exceed its fatigue limit.
» A hero cannot resolve a card's fatigue ability if they cannot place the number of fatigue tokens required by the ability on that card.
» After placing the required number of fatigue tokens on the card that has a fatigue ability, the hero can resolve that ability's effect by reading its text and following its instructions.
» If a fatigue ability is prefaced by an 'X' instead of a value, the hero may place any number of fatigue on that ability's card as long as they do not exceed that card's fatigue limit.


2
Keywords
Keyword Abilities: Some abilities are presented as keywords. A keyword is a shorthand for a specific ability that appears frequently on cards.

Secondary Abilities
Secondary Abilities: A secondary ability is a passive ability provided by secondary weapon parts. If a hero is using a weapon that has secondary abilities, they are automatically resolved by the app.
» A hero can view the secondary abilities on their equipped weapons in the hero information screen.
» The party can view all their secondary weapon parts and the secondary abilities they provide in the parts inventory screen.

Surge Abilities
Surge Abilities: A surge ability is any ability that is prefaced by a surge (   ) icon. Many cards have surge abilities, including all hero cards.
» A hero can use their surge abilities any time they roll a die.
» To use a surge ability, a hero spends a surge icon from one of their die results and then resolves the ability's effect by reading its text and following the instructions.
» Each surge ability can be used only once per roll (typically an attack, defense, or test).
» A hero can spend multiple surge (   ) results after a roll; however, each surge ability can be used only once per roll (typically an attack, defense, or test).

Actions
During a hero's turn, they can perform one maneuver action and up to two other actions of their choice.

» There are five actions available, as follows: Maneuver, Explore, Fight, Ready, and Unique. » A hero can perform the same action multiple times.
» A hero does not have to perform all of their actions during their turn.
» A hero can resolve other effects, including spending movement points, between actions.
» After a hero has performed all of their actions, that hero can resolve abilities and spend movement points.
» If a hero resolves an ability that has the shift keyword, that hero can move up to the number of spaces that correspond to that keyword.

Explore Action
The explore action allows a hero to interact with explore tokens and 3D terrain.
» A hero can interact with any 3D terrain that they are adjacent to or any explore token that they are either adjacent to or share a space with.
» To perform the explore action, the hero selects and drags their portrait in the app to the 3D terrain or explore token that they wish to interact with. Then, the hero follows the instructions that the app provides.

Fight Action
The fight action allows a hero to attack an enemy. See Hero Attack.

Maneuver Action
The maneuver action is an action that provides a hero with movement points, which allows them to move during their turn.
» When a hero performs a maneuver action, they gain a number of movement points equal to their speed. · If a hero is impeded when they perform a maneuver action, they only gain one movement point.
· A hero's speed is presented as a value on their hero card next to their speed icon.
» A hero has resolved a maneuver action after they have gained their movement points. The act of moving a hero is not part of the maneuver action.
» A hero can spend movement points between actions during their turn, and any movement points not spent are lost when the hero ends their turn.

Ready Action
The ready action allows a hero to flip a card that is in their play area.
To perform the ready action, a hero performs the following steps in order:
1. Choose Card: The hero chooses their hero card, attack card, or one of the skill cards that is in their play area.

2. Remove Tokens: The hero removes all condition and fatigue tokens that are on that card. 3. Flip Card: The hero flips the chosen card to its other side.
» If one of the tokens that was removed during the ready action was a scarred condition token, the hero suffers two damage after the card is flipped.

Unique Action (  )
The unique action allows a hero to resolve effects on their cards that are prefaced with the unique action (  ) icon.
» A hero can resolve multiple unique actions during their turn, but they cannot resolve a single ability that is prefaced by a unique action (  ) icon more than once during that turn.
» Each unique action icon is paired with a number—either '1' or '2.' This number determines how many actions a player must use during their turn to resolve that ability.
· If a hero wishes to resolve an ability prefaced by a '1  ,' that hero must spend an action to do so. That spent action cannot be that hero's maneuver-only action; it must be one of their other two actions.
· If a hero wishes to resolve an ability that is prefaced by a '2  ,' that hero must spend both of their non-maneuver actions to do so. That is, if a hero resolves an ability prefaced by a '2  ,' the only other action that a hero can perform during that turn is a maneuver action.

Adjacency
Map tiles are divided into spaces. If two spaces share a border or a corner, those spaces are adjacent. If game components, such as figures, tokens, and 3D terrain occupy adjacent spaces, those components are adjacent to each other.

» When a hero moves, they move from the space they currently occupy to an adjacent space. » When an enemy moves, it moves from the space it currently occupies to an adjacent space. » If a hero and enemy are adjacent to each other, they can attack each other.

Adjacency and Elevation
Spaces that are at different elevations are treated as adjacent for most game effects. If two spaces at different elevations would share a border or a corner if they were at the same elevation, those spaces are treated as adjacent for the following purposes:
» Downward Movement: A hero or enemy can move from a space of higher elevation to a space of lower elevation.
» Upward Movement Using Staircases: A hero or enemy can move to or from a space on a staircase if the difference in elevation is less than one level.




















» Determining Range: When counting spaces to determine the range for effects or ranged attacks, range can be counted up and down elevation ignoring levels. However, range cannot be counted through a tile—from a tile's facedown side to its faceup side or vice versa (see 'overhangs').
» Melee Attacks: A hero or enemy can resolve melee attacks if the difference in elevation between the attacker and the target is one level or less.



4


















Interactions: Heroes can interact with tokens or 3D terrain if the difference in elevation between the hero and the object is one level or less.
Sight Tokens: Heroes activate sight tokens if the difference in elevation between the hero and the token is one level or less.
Impeding: Heroes impede enemies, and vice versa, if the difference in elevation between them is one level or less.

Adjacency and Underlays
Underlays are treated as extensions of the map tiles that are placed on top of them. An underlay space shares a border—and is therefore adjacent to—any abutting space on that map tile.
» Heroes and enemies can move into a space of an underlay normally, as if the underlay was an extension of the map tile that is placed on top of it.
· Each type of underlay has unique effects for both heroes and enemies.

Advantage (   )
Advantage (   ) is a die result that has no inherent affect. After a hero rolls a die for an attack, defense, test, or any other game effect, a hero can convert advantage (   ) results to success (   ) results.

» To convert an advantage (   ) result to a success (   ) result, a hero places one fatigue token on one of their cards of their choice. Then, they can spend that advantage as if it was a success (   ) result.
· A hero can only place fatigue on a card that has a fatigue limit and only if the number of fatigue tokens on that card does not exceed that limit.
» If there are multiple advantage (   ) results from the same roll, a hero can convert any number of those results, placing one fatigue token for each result they wish to convert.
· A hero does not have to place each fatigue token on the same card.
» Some abilities cost one or more advantages to activate. To pay this cost, spend the indicated amount of advantages (   ) from a roll.	spent in this way cannot be converted to a success (   ) or spent on another ability.

Armor

Stressed
Stressed is a hero condition. If a game effect would cause a hero to gain this condition, they take a stress token from the supply and place it on a card in their play area.








» Many effects specify the card where the hero must place the condition. If a card is not specified, the hero can place the token on their hero card, attack card, or any of their skill cards.
» Before a hero discards one or more condition tokens from a card that is stressed, they must suffer 1 fatigue (   ). This includes discarding the stress token itself.
· This fatigue can be suffered on any of the hero’s cards that has a faitgue limit.
· The hero suffers one damage (   ) for each fatigue that cannot be placed this way.
» If an effect would discard multiple conditions from a stressed card, the hero only suffers 1 fatigue (   ).
· Flipping a card discards all condition tokens on that card. As a result, if that card is stressed, the hero must suffer 1 fatigue before discarding those tokens.
» Effects that cause a hero to gain a stressed condition use the word 'stress.' For example, 'Then stress a card.'




21
Consumables
Consumables, which are represented by consumable cards, can provide a hero with a variety of single-use abilities during a quest.





















» Each consumable card has two sides. One side is the standard version of the consumable, and the other side is the upgraded version of the consumable.
· An upgraded consumable is indicated by an upgrade icon that is presented next to word 'Consumable' at the bottom the card.
· A consumable card cannot be flipped during a quest.
» To use a consumable, a hero resolves its effect by following the instructions on the card. Then, the hero sets aside the consumable card, removing it from their play area.
· Common: There are four copies of each common consumable—enough for each hero to equip one during a four-player game.
· Limited: There are two copies of each limited consumable. Additionally, limited consumables can only be equipped by the heroes whose names are presented at the top of the card.
· Unique: There is only one copy of each unique consumable. These consumables must be found, they cannot be crafted.

Equipping Consumables
Before a quest, when each hero is selecting their weapons and trinket in the hero loadout screen, they can choose to equip up to three consumables from the party inventory.
» To equip a consumable card, the hero places it their play area with the appropriate side faceup.
» The default side is the standard side. If the equipment has been upgraded, they place it with the upgraded side faceup instead.
· A hero cannot equip more than one copy of a consumable that has the same name.
» This means a hero cannot equip a standard version and upgraded version of the same card.
· A hero cannot equip a limited consumable that does not have their name presented at the top of that consumable's card.
» Heroes gain consumables through crafting. Crafting recipes for consumables can be found during quests or awarded for completing feats.

Gaining Consumables
When a hero crafts a consumable, that consumable is added to the party's inventory for the remainder of the campaign and the party can use all copies of that consumable.

Using Consumables
A hero can only use each consumable once per quest, unless a game effect specifically allows otherwise.
» Crafted consumables that are used during a quest can be equipped again at the start of a future quest. They are not removed from the party inventory and they do not need to be crafted again.

22
» There are three types of consumables. A consumable's type is presented next to the word 'Consumable' at the bottom of the card. The types are:
· Common: There are four copies of each common consumable—enough for each hero to equip one during a four-player game.
· Limited: There are two copies of each limited consumable. Additionally, limited consumables can only be equipped by the heroes whose names are presented at the top of the card.
· Unique: There is only one copy of each unique consumable. These consumables must be found, they cannot be crafted.

Damage (   )
Damage is represented as an icon (   ) and a value. Typically, heroes and enemies suffer damage by being attacked. However, they can suffer damage because of other game effects as well.

Damage Types
The left side of each weapon card has one or more damage types. Most enemies are weak to some damage types. During a hero's attack, for each success a hero spends, the enemy suffers one additional damage for each of the weapon's damage types that the enemy is weak to. This is calculated by the app.
» The damage types that an enemy is weak to are displayed as '?' until the weakness is revealed.






· The first time an enemy suffers damage of a type that they are weak to, that weakness is revealed for the duration of the campaign.
» There are nine damage types, as follows: · Crush









· Pierce











· Slash










23










· Anemos











· Aquos











· Fortunos
















· Ignos









24










· Lumos











· Mortos
















· Terros











· Toxos








25














· Umbros










· Vigos

















Direct Damage
Direct damage refers to damage that a hero or enemy suffers from an ability.
» If an enemy suffers damage from an ability, that enemy's current health is adjusted in its enemy information screen. An enemy's health can be manually decreased as necessary by using the arrow to the left of its health bar.
· An enemy's defense does not reduce the amount of damage suffered in this way.








» If a hero suffers damage from an ability, that hero's current health is adjusted on their health dial. · A hero is not able to defend to attempt to reduce the amount of damage suffered in this way.


26
Enemy Activation Damage
Each enemy has a damage value that is used during attacks. This value is presented on an enemy's activation screen.


















» When an enemy attacks a hero, that hero suffers an amount of damage equal to the damage value on the enemy's activation screen.
» This damage can include the following modifications:
· This damage is reduced by one for each success (   ) a hero spends during their defense.
· This damage is reduced by 20%, rounded up, if the enemy is suffering from the enfeebled condition. · This damage can be increased or decreased from other abilities on cards and in the app.

Weapon Damage
Each weapon has a damage value that is used during attacks.
» When a hero is attacking an enemy, for each success (   ) a hero inputs into the app, that enemy suffers an amount of damage equal to the damage value on the weapon being used for that attack.
» The app automatically calculates and applies damage, which can include the following modifications: · This damage is reduced by a random number between zero and the enemy's defense value.
· For each success spent, this damage is increased by one for each of the weapon's damage types that enemy is weak to.
· This damage is increased by 20%, rounded up, if the enemy is suffering the exposed status. · This damage can be increased by effects from trinkets and secondary abilities.

Darkness Phase
The darkness phase represents the passage of time, during which foes and other elements of the quest attempt to thwart the heroes' goals.

The darkness phase consists of four steps that the app guides the players through using a series of prompts. These steps are as follows:
1. Time Passes: During this step, each hero suffers the effects of all infected and terrified condition tokens on their cards. Then, each hero can discard one fatigue token from any card in their play area.
2. Enemy Activation: During this step, the app activates each enemy on the map, one at a time.
» For each of these activations, the app displays an enemy activation screen that the party uses to resolve that enemy's activation.
» After an activation is resolved, the party selects the 'Done' button, which causes the app to proceed either to the next activation or to the next step of the darkness phase if there are no more activations to resolve.
3. Quest: During this step, the app may display quest-specific prompts.
» These prompts may trigger quest-specific events, instruct players to spawn enemies, update the party's objectives, and more. 4. Tactics: During this step, the app may display descriptions of enemy behavior. These descriptions provide the party with hints about an enemy's intentions. These hints may help the heroes plan their next turns.




27
Dice
There are three custom dice that players roll when they attack, defend, or perform tests.
























Each die has the combination of the following results: success (   ), advantage (   ), and surge (  ).

Difficulty
Before starting a campaign, the heroes select a difficulty setting for the first quest. Before beginning each subsequent quest, the heroes can change the difficulty setting in the hero loadout screen.

There are four difficulty settings: Journey, Standard, Heroic, and Warfare.

Heroic
This difficulty setting is for players who like to optimize their decisions and engage with every game system. When this setting is selected, the app makes the following adjustments:
» Enemy health is increased by 20%.
» Every 6 rounds, enemy activation damage is permanently increased by 1 until the end of the quest. » Each enemy type has one additional resistance.

Journey
This is the easiest difficulty setting and is designed for players who want to enjoy the campaign's story and feel heroic. When this setting is selected, the app makes the following adjustments:
» Enemy health is reduced by 20%.
» Enemy activation damage is decreased by 1.

Standard
This difficulty setting is for players who want to be challenged, but who prefer to win most of the quests.

Warfare
This is the hardest difficulty setting and is designed for players who want an extreme challenge. When this setting is selected, the app makes the following adjustments:
» Enemy health is increased by 20%.
» Every 4 rounds, enemy activation damage is permanently increased by 1 until the end of the quest.
» When an enemy is attacked, the damage the enemy suffers is reduced by a random number between zero and twice the enemy's defense.
» Each enemy type has one additional resistance.


28
Elevation
Maps frequently have multiple levels of elevation. When placing tiles that are elevated, those tiles are supported by inserting them into pillars.

Each pillar can attach to a map tile in two ways, either using a notch that depicts a gargoyle or a notch that does not depict a gargoyle. When constructing any elevated portion of the map, reference the app to ensure that the pillars are oriented the same way that the app displays.

Elevation and Levels
Starting from the map tile on the table (or other play surface), each level of elevation is higher than the previous level by approximately the height of one staircase (or the distance to the next notch on a pillar).













» Figures can move downward any number of levels.






















» Figures cannot move directly upward an entire level (i.e., from a level-one map tile to a level-two map tile). Instead, they must use a staircase.
» Underlays are treated as if they are on the same level as the map tiles that are placed on top of them.
» A figure can resolve a melee attack against another figure at a different elevation level if the difference in elevation between both figures is one level or less.
» When counting spaces to determine the range for effects or ranged attacks, range can be counted up and down elevation ignoring levels. However, range cannot be counted through a tile—from a tile's facedown side to its faceup side or vice versa (see overhangs).






29































Enemies
Enemies are the various monsters and villains that the heroes encounter during the game. Each enemy on the map is represented by a figure, and information about that enemy is found in the app.

» An enemy's plastic figure is used to represent that enemy's location on the map.
· Each enemy in play has an ID marker that consists of a color and one to four notches. An enemy's ID marker distinguishes that enemy from other enemies of the same type.












» An enemy figure that occupies only one space on the map is small enemy. An enemy figure that occupies more than one space on the map is a large enemy.

Defeated
If an enemy's health ever is reduced to zero, that enemy is defeated. When an enemy is defeated, its figure is removed from the map and placed in the supply.
» The app instructs the heroes to remove an enemy figure when it is defeated.



30
Enemy Abilities
Each enemy has an activation ability and defense ability.
» An enemy's activation ability can modify the rules of its activation. During an enemy's activation, that enemy's ability is displayed on the enemy activation screen.
· When an enemy activates, the party reads that enemy's abilities and applies its effect to the activation as instructed.
» An enemy's defense ability can modify the effects of a hero's attack. During a hero's attack, an enemy's defense ability is displayed on the hero attack screen.
· When a hero is attacking an enemy, they read that enemy's ability and apply its effect to the attack as instructed. · Some defense abilities are applied by the app automatically.

Enemy Activation
During the 'Enemy Activation' step of the darkness phase, each enemy activates in an order that is determined by the app. When it is an enemy's turn to activate, the app displays that enemy's activation screen. The party uses the displayed information to move the enemy and then perform its attack by following these steps:
The party uses the following four pieces of information to move the enemy and then perform its attack: speed, target, range, and damage.'
1. Gain Movement Points: The enemy gains a number of movement points equal to its speed.
2. Determine Target: The enemy determines its target according to its target priority and how many movement points it has to spend.
3. Move Toward Target: The enemy spends its movement points to move within range of its target and to the ideal space according to its movement preferences.
4. Attack Target: The enemy attacks its target, if possible.
After an activation is resolved, the party selects the 'Done' button, which causes the app to proceed either to the next activation or to the next step of the darkness phase if there are no more activations to resolve.
Each enemy has an activation ability that can modify the rules of its activation. During an enemy's activation, that enemy's ability is displayed on the enemy activation. When an enemy activates, the party reads that enemy's abilities and applies its effect to the activation as instructed.

Enemy Damage
If the enemy is able to attack a hero, it attacks for an amount of damage equal to the damage value displayed on its activation screen.
» The hero defends before suffering damage.

Speed and Range
An enemy's speed indicates how many movement points it can spend during its activation. » When an enemy is activated, it gains movement points equal to its speed.
· If the enemy is impeded, it gains only one movement point instead.
» An enemy spends movement points to move to a space on the map where it can attack its target.
· If there is not a range value on the enemy activation screen, the activating enemy moves so it is adjacent to its target.
· If there is a range value on the enemy activation screen, the activating enemy moves so its range to the target is equal to that value and so the activating enemy has line of sight to the target.
· If the enemy cannot position itself to be at a range equal to that value, the enemy positions itself so it is as close to that value as possible while staying within range of the enemy.
· To position itself at a range equal to the value on the activation screen, an enemy moves either toward or away from its target. However, an enemy will not move toward and away from its target during the same activation. For example, an enemy cannot move toward its target and pass by it to better position itself on the other side of the target.
· If the enemy cannot move to be within range of its target, it changes its target to the next target in the priority list.
» During an enemy's activation, if the enemy cannot attack any target within the targeting priority, that enemy moves toward the hero it is closest to that has the least health.
· If multiple heroes are equally close and equally have the lowest health, the enemy moves toward the hero among them of the party's choice. The party does not have to choose a hero that optimally benefits the enemy.


31
» An enemy becomes impeded only if doing so best satisfies its other targeting and movement criteria (e.g., allowing the enemy to attack its highest-priority target). After satisfying all other criteria, if the enemy can end its movement in a space that does not cause it to become impeded, it prefers that space to a space that does cause it to become impeded.

Targets
An enemy's target is the hero displayed on the enemy activation screen. The displayed target is who the activating enemy prefers to attack. If an enemy cannot attack its displayed target, the enemy chooses a different target that it can attack.
An enemy's target priority is as follows:
1. The hero who is displayed as the target on the enemy activation screen.
» If an effect changes an enemy's target or indicates that another hero 'becomes the target,' the new target is treated as if it was displayed as the target on the enemy activation screen for the purposes of that enemy's target priority.
2. The hero who is closest to the activating enemy.
» This is determined before the enemy spends any movement points.
3. The hero who has the least health among heroes who are equally the closest to the activating enemy.
4. The hero of the party's choice among those who are both equally the closest to the activating enemy and who equally have the least health.
» The party does not have to choose a hero that optimally benefits the enemy.

Enemy Tactics
During the tactics step of the darkness phase, the app will select an enemy to perform a special tactic activation in the following round.
» When an enemy prepares a tactic activation, the app will display a message to provide the party with hints about an enemy's intentions. These hints may help the heroes plan their next turns.
» When an enemy has a tactic activation prepared, it may also gain additional effects or abilities in response to hero attacks or interactions.
» In all cases, the result of an enemy tactic will be described to the heroes by the app.

Enemy Attacks
During an enemy's activation, it attempts to attack the target hero. When an enemy attacks, the target hero suffers an amount of damage equal to the damage value displayed on the enemy's activation screen.
» This damage can include the following modifications:
· This damage is reduced by one for each success success (   ) a hero spends during its defense.
· This damage is reduced by 20%, rounded up, if the enemy is suffering from the enfeebled condition. · This damage is increased by one if the hero is adjacent to a barricade.
· This damage can be increased or decreased from other abilities on cards and in the app.

Hero Defense
Before suffering damage during an attack, a hero defends to reduce the amount of damage they suffer.
» To defend, the hero rolls the die that is displayed next to their defense icon on their hero card. Then, they may resolve each die icon as follows:
· success (   ): The hero can spend each success (   ) result to reduce the damage they would suffer by one. · advantage (   ): The hero can place fatigue tokens to convert one advantage (   ) result to one success (   ) result for each fatigue token that is placed.
· surge (  ):The hero can spend surge (   ) results to resolve surge abilities.
» During a hero's defense, their equipped armor may provide them with automatic success (   ) results or additional dice to roll.
· If a hero's armor card has a value and success icon presented next to a defense icon, that armor provides a number of automatic successes equal to that value. These successes are in addition to any provided from dice results.
· A hero can spend these automatic successes identically to a success produced by their roll. » After the hero defends, they suffer all remaining damage.
· To suffer damage, the hero rotates their health dial to decrease their health by the amount of damage suffered.
· If a hero's health ever is reduced to zero, they are wounded.


32
» If the timing of an ability uses the word 'defense,' that ability is referring to the event that begins when a hero rolls a die to reduce damage and ends after the hero suffers any remaining damage.

Enemy Bar
An enemy bar contains an image, ID marker, and level for each enemy that is in play.
















» Enemy bars are displayed in the app on the map screen and the enemy overview screen.
· The app automatically adds and removes enemy bars when an enemy is placed on or removed from the map. · There is always one enemy bar displayed in the app for each enemy that is on the map.
» A hero can select an enemy's bar to view that enemy's information screen.
» To attack an enemy, a hero can select and drag from their hero's portrait to that enemy's enemy bar.
» During the Darkness Phase, enemies always activate in the order that their enemy bars are displayed in the app, beginning with the enemy whose enemy bar is displayed at the top of the screen and ending with the enemy whose enemy bar is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

Enemy Defense
Each enemy has a defense value which reduces the amount of damage it suffers during an attack. An enemy's defense can be viewed in the app on an enemy's information screen or below an enemy's figure on the enemy overview screen. » When an enemy is attacked, the damage the enemy suffers is reduced by a random number between zero and the enemy's defense.
· This reduction of damage is calculated automatically by the app.
· An enemy's defense reduces the damage it suffers each time it is attacked.
» If a game effect other than an attack causes an enemy to suffer damage, that damage is not reduced by that enemy's defense.

Enemy Health
Each enemy has a health bar that displays its current health. An enemy's health bar can be viewed in the app on an enemy's information screen or below an enemy's figure on the enemy overview screen.















» During an attack, an enemy's health decreases automatically when the enemy suffers damage.


33
» If an in-app effect or ability heals an enemy, that enemy's health increase automatically.
» A hero can manually adjust an enemy's health by using the arrows on either side of its health bar in an enemy's information screen.
· The primary reason a hero would do this is if they resolve an ability that causes an enemy to suffer damage directly, as opposed to damaging the enemy by attacking it.

Enemy Level
Each enemy has a level that is represented as a value. The higher the value, the more powerful the enemy is.
» An enemy's level is displayed in the app on that enemy's bar, on the enemy overview screen, and on the enemy's information and activation screens.
» Higher-level enemies have more health and defense, and they have stronger attacks and abilities.

Enemy Movement
Enemies usually move during their activation as determined by their speed and range. Other game effects can allow a hero to move an enemy as well. All movement follows the rules in this section.
The movement rules for small and large enemies vary slightly.

Large Enemy Movement
Large enemies follow the same movement rules as small enemies with the following exceptions:
» When a large enemy moves, the heroes choose one space that is adjacent to a space that the large enemy occupies. Then, they move the enemy so that any part of its base occupies the chosen space.























» If a large enemy figure ends its movement so that a portion of its base hangs off a staircase step, a riser is placed under the unsupported part of the figure to prevent it from tilting.















34






















» When moving up and down elevation, a large figure must end its movement so all portions of its base are on the same level.
· Ending its movement on the step of a staircase is an exception to this rule.

Small Enemy Movement
When an enemy moves, they move from the space they currently occupy to an adjacent space.
» An enemy can move from a space of higher elevation to a space of lower elevation if those spaces are treated as adjacent (see adjacency and elevation and staircases).
· An enemy can move from a space of lower elevation up to a space on a staircase or from a space on a staircase up to a space of higher elevation if those spaces are treated as adjacent.
» An enemy can move in the following ways:
· An enemy can move one space by spending one of their movement points. · An enemy can move if an effect instructs them to.
· If a hero resolves an ability that moves an enemy using the shift keyword, that hero can move the enemy up to the number of spaces that correspond to that keyword.
· For example, if an ability allows a hero to shift an enemy two spaces, that hero can move the enemy zero, one, or two spaces.
» When an enemy moves, they must obey the following rules: · An enemy must move into an adjacent space.
· An enemy cannot move into a space that contains 3D terrain.
· An enemy cannot move into a space that contains a hero figure. · An enemy can move into a space that contains a token.
· An enemy can move into a space that contains an enemy figure, but only if they can move out of that space immediately. In other words, an enemy can move through a space that contains another enemy. · If an enemy's figure cannot fit underneath an overhang—that is, if the figure cannot stand normally
without touching the tile above it—that figure cannot move or be moved into a space that is underneath that overhang.
· The arch of the archway terrain piece is not an overhang. A figure can move into the spaces under an archway even if the figure does not fit.

Enemy Overview Screen
The primary function of the enemy overview screen is to display each enemy figure that is in play and the following information for each of those enemies:



35
















» Defense » Health
» ID marker » Level
» Statuses
» Weaknesses
» Players can toggle between the map screen and the enemy overview screen by selecting the buttons in the upper-right corner.

Spawning Enemies
During a quest, the app instructs the players when and where to spawn enemies.
» When the app instructs a player to spawn an enemy on the map, the instructions indicate the type and number of enemies to spawn, where to place them on the map, and what color ID marker to insert into their bases.
» Before placing an enemy figure on the map, an ID marker is inserted into that figure's base. The inserted ID marker should match the color that was assigned to that enemy.

















» If players cannot distinguish an enemy by its color, they should distinguish an enemy by the number of notches that are exposed on the enemy's bar and ID marker.

Equipment
Equipment refers to the weapons and items that the heroes use throughout their campaign.

» Equipment is represented by double-sided cards. One side of the card is the standard version of the equipment and one side is the upgraded version.
· Upgraded equipment is indicated by an upgrade icon that is presented next to the card's type.

36
· Heroes can upgrade their equipment by visiting the crafthall.
» Each card indicates what type of equipment it is. There are four types: weapon, armor, trinket, and consumable. » The party's inventory of equipment is tracked by the app and viewable in the party menu at any time.
· The party's inventory is limitless.
» At the start of a quest, each hero can choose to equip the following: · Two weapons (creating one attack card)
· One armor · One trinket
· Three Consumables
» During setup, each hero places their chosen equipment in their play area with the appropriate side faceup.
· The default side is the standard side. If the equipment has been upgraded, they may place it with the upgraded side faceup instead.

Essences
An essence is a rare type of material used to craft equipment.

» Like other materials, essences can be found during quests and purchased by visiting the shop.

Events
Events can appear in the city and on the campaign map and represent a variety of locations, people, and occurrences. Events advance the narrative and provide the heroes with rewards and other surprises.

» To resolve an event, the heroes select the event in the app and follow the instructions. · Some events require the heroes to travel to a particular destination.
» There are two types of events, as follows:
· Regular: This type of event can appear in the city and on the campaign map.
· Travel: This type of event only appears on the campaign map and requires the heroes to travel to that event's location to resolve it.

Experience (XP)
As heroes progress through the campaign, they automatically gain experience (XP), which is used to equip unlocked skills.

» Heroes do not share XP; however, all heroes gain XP at the same rate.
· If a hero gains XP during a quest, any heroes that were not used during that quest still gain that XP. » Heroes can view their XP in the hero skills screen that is accessible from the party menu.
» Each skill card has an XP cost, as does each weapon with the 'Rune' trait.
» Before a quest, when each hero is selecting their weapons and trinket in the hero loadout screen, they can choose to equip any number of their skills.
· When preparing for a quest, the total XP of a hero's equipped cards cannot exceed that hero's XP.
· XP is never lost or permanently expended. A hero’s XP reflects the maximum XP cost of all the cards that heroes can equip at the start of each quest.

Explore Tokens
Explore tokens are placed on the map and represent points of interest.









» A hero can interact with an explore token by performing an explore action.
» To interact with an explore token, a hero performs an explore action by selecting and dragging from their portrait in the app to that explore token. Then, the hero follows the instructions that the app provides.
· A hero can interact with any explore token that they are either adjacent to or share a space with.


37
Fatigue (  )
Fatigue is represented by fatigue tokens that heroes can place on their hero, attack, and skill cards. Fatigue is an indication of a hero exerting additional effort during their quest. This effort can help a hero succeed at a crucial moment, but the fatigue they accumulate can hinder them if they do not manage it carefully.

» Fatigue accumulates when a hero converts advantage, resolves fatigue abilities, or is forced to suffer fatigue from other game effects.

Fatigue Abilities
Cards in a hero's play area may contain fatigue abilities. A fatigue ability is any ability that is prefaced with afatigue (   ) icon and a number. That number indicates the amount of fatigue a hero must place to resolve that ability.
» Before resolving a fatigue ability's effect, a hero must place the required number of fatigue tokens on the card that has that fatigue ability.
· The number of fatigue tokens a hero must place on that card is equal to the number that prefaces the fatigue ability.
· For example, if an ability is prefaced by '2  ', that hero must place two fatigue tokens on the card that has that ability.
· The number of fatigue tokens on that card cannot exceed its fatigue limit.
» A hero cannot resolve a card's fatigue ability if they cannot place the number of fatigue tokens required by the ability on that card.
» After placing the required number of fatigue tokens on the card that has a fatigue ability, the hero can resolve that ability's effect by reading its text and following its instructions.
» If a fatigue ability is prefaced by an 'X' instead of a value, the hero may place any number of fatigue on that ability's card as long as they do not exceed that card's fatigue limit.

Fatigue and Advantage
After a hero rolls a die for an attack, defense, test, or any other game effect, a hero can place fatigue on their hero, attack, or skill cards to convert advantage (   ) results to success (   ) results.
» To convert an advantage (   ) result to a success (   ) result, a hero places one fatigue token on one of their cards of their choice. Then, they can spend that advantage as if it was a success (   ) result.
· A hero can only place fatigue on a card that has a fatigue limit and only if the number of fatigue tokens on that card does not exceed that limit.
» If there are multiple advantage (   ) results from the same roll, a hero can convert any number of those results, placing one fatigue token for each result they wish to convert.
· A hero does not have to place each fatigue token on the same card.
» A hero can choose to convert advantage (   ) after rolling a die for an attack, defense, test, or any other game effect. » Some game effects allow a hero to convert advantage without placing a fatigue token or allowing heroes to convert multiple advantage results for each fatigue token placed.

Fatigue Limit
A fatigue limit is a value presented on a card that indicates the maximum number of fatigue tokens a hero can place on that card.
» If a card does not have a fatigue limit, a fatigue token cannot be placed on that card.
» If a card has a fatigue limit of '0,' a fatigue token cannot be placed on that card while its fatigue limit remains at '0.' » Some abilities can increase or decrease a card's fatigue limit.
· If a card has a fatigue limit of '0,' that card's fatigue limit can be increased.
· If a card does not have a fatigue limit, that card's fatigue limit cannot be increased.
» Fatigue limits can prevent a hero from placing fatigue on a card to convert advantage, resolve a fatigue ability, or suffer fatigue.
· A hero cannot convert an advantage result if they cannot place a fatigue token on one of their cards.
· A hero cannot resolve a card's fatigue ability if they cannot place the number of fatigue tokens required by the ability on that card.
· When a hero suffers fatigue, for each fatigue token that a hero cannot place on a card, they suffer one damage instead.

Suffering Fatigue
Some game effects may require a hero to 'suffer' fatigue.


38
» When a hero suffers fatigue, they must place the specified number of fatigue tokens on any of their cards that has a fatigue limit.
· Some abilities may specify a card or card type that the fatigue token must be placed on. · The number of fatigue tokens on a card cannot exceed its fatigue limit.
» When a hero suffers fatigue, the fatigue tokens do not have to be placed on the same card, unless the effect specifies otherwise.
» When a hero suffers fatigue, for each fatigue token that a hero cannot place on a card, they suffer one damage instead.
» When suffering fatigue, if a hero can place fatigue on a card, they must. They cannot choose not to place fatigue and suffer damage instead.

Feats
Each hero has unique feats that they can complete to progress their personal growth and earn rewards. Feats are automatically tracked by the app.

» Each hero has one feat active at a time. When a hero completes a feat, they claim a reward and the app prompts them to select a new active feat.
· Rewards often include skills and recipes.
» A hero can view their active feat and all completed feats at any time through the party menu. » A hero's progress toward completing a feat carries over between quests.

Feat Replacement
Heroes can choose to reset progress on their active feats and select a new active feat to replace them.
» In the Feats menu, a hero can tap the small 'X' button to replace their active feat. When they do so, they will be prompted to choose one of two available feats to replace it.
» The heroes have a limited number of Feat Replacements available, shared among all the heroes. After each quest, they gain one additional feat reset.
» When a feat is replaced, heroes lose all progress towards that feat.
» Completed feats cannot be replaced, and earned rewards are unaffected by feat replacements.

Game Round
Each game round consists of a Hero Phase followed by a Darkness Phase. After resolving the Darkness Phase, a new game round begins starting with the Hero Phase. Players continue to resolve game rounds until the quest they are playing ends.

Gold
The party gains gold throughout the campaign. The gold that the party gains is tracked by the app and is viewable in the party inventory screen.

















» Heroes can use gold to purchase materials at the shop. · Shops may occasionally sell recipes and equipment.
» Heroes can gain gold by selling materials at the shop.


39
Health Dial
A hero's health dial is used to track that hero's current health.

» At the start of a quest, a hero's health dial is set to match their maximum health.














· A hero's maximum health is the health value presented on their hero card plus any additional health provided to them through other cards (such as armor) or abilities.
» If a hero suffers damage (   ), they rotate their health dial to decrease their health by the amount of damage suffered. If a hero is reduced to zero health, they are wounded.
» If there is excess damage that was not suffered when the hero was wounded, that damage is ignored.
» If a hero heals health (   ), they rotate their health dial to increase their health by the amount healed. A hero's health cannot exceed their maximum health.

Hero Phase
Each hero can take up to one turn during each hero phase. During a hero's turn, that hero can perform one manuever action and two additional actions.

» Each game round consists of a hero phase followed by a Darkness Phase. After resolving the Darkness Phase, a new game round begins starting with the hero phase. Players continue to resolve game rounds until the quest they are playing ends. » The party chooses the order in which heroes take their turns, and this order can change from round to round.
» During a hero's turn, that hero can perform a maneuver action and two additional actions of their choice, spend any number of their movement points, and resolve any number of their abilities.
· A hero can perform the same action multiple times, including multiple maneuver actions. · To resolve an ability, a hero must read the ability's text and follow its instructions.

Heroes
There are six heroes included in the game. Each hero is represented by a plastic figure, a hero card, and health dial.

» A hero's plastic figure is placed on the game map and represents that hero's location. » A hero's card contains information about that hero.
» A hero's health dial is used to track that hero's current health.
» At the start of the campaign and before each quest, each player selects one hero to control. · This selection is prompted by the app.
· Some quests may require the party to include a specific hero.
» Four heroes—Brynn, Syrus, Vaerix, and Galaden—are available at the start of the campaign. » Two heroes—Chance and Kehli—become available during the campaign.
» Rules may refer to a player as a hero. The term 'player' and 'hero' are interchangeable in rules text.

Hero Attacks
The primary way a hero attacks an enemy is by performing a fight action during their turn. However, other game affects may allow a hero to attack an enemy.
To resolve an attack, a hero follows these steps in order:
1. Choose Enemy: The hero chooses an enemy that is within range and in line of sight of their figure. » Any abilities that have timing that reads, 'Before your attack,' are resolved before this step.
2. Select Enemy: The hero selects and drags from their portrait in the app to the enemy they chose.

40
» The hero can drag to the chosen enemy's figure on the enemy information screen or the chosen enemy's bar on any screen where it appears.


















3. Select Weapon: The hero selects the weapon in the app that they are using for this attack.
» Unless a game effect allows otherwise, the hero selects the weapon on their attack card that is currently faceup. 4. Roll Die: The hero rolls the die depicted next to their attack icon on their hero card.
» Some abilities may provide a hero with additional dice to roll.
5. Manipulate Results: In any order, the hero can convert advantage (   ) results, spend surge (   ) results to resolve surge abilities, and resolve any other abilities that change, add, or spend die results.
» Many abilities that have timing that reads, 'During your attack,' are resolved during this step. » If the enemy is adjacent to a barricade, the attack adds one success (   ) result.
» 6. Input Successes: The hero inputs the number of successes into the app and selects the 'Confirm' button. Then, the hero follows the instructions that the app provides.
If the enemy is defeated, the app instructs the hero to remove that enemy from the map.
» Any abilities that have timing that reads, 'After your attack,' are resolved immediately after this step.
» After selecting 'Confirm' the app automatically calculates and applies damage to the enemy and may provide the hero with additional instructions. These calculations are as follows:
· For each success (   ) a hero inputs into the app, that enemy suffers an amount of damage equal to the damage value on the weapon being used for that attack.
· This damage is reduced by a random number between zero and the enemy's defense value.
· For each success spent, this damage is increased by one for each of the weapon's damage types that enemy is weak to.
· This damage can be increased by 20%, rounded up, if the enemy is suffering the exposed status.

Hero Card
A hero card contains information about a hero, such as their name, stats, unique abilities, and the types of armor they can equip.
















41
























» A hero's health is presented as a value on their hero card next to their health icon.
· A hero's maximum health is the health value presented on their hero card plus any additional health provided to them through other cards—such as armor—or abilities.
» A hero's speed is presented as a value on their hero card next to their speed icon.
· A hero's speed value indicates how many movement points that hero gains when they perform a maneuver action.
» Each hero card contains that hero's unique hero and surge abilities. · Each hero has a unique hero ability on each side of its hero card.
· Each hero has a unique surge ability that is the same on both sides of its hero card. » Each hero card has a fatigue limit.
· The fatigue limit indicates the maximum number of fatigue tokens that can be on that card at the same time. » Each hero card depicts that hero's attack die next to their attack icon.
· This is the die that the hero rolls when performing an attack.
» Each hero card depicts that hero's defense die next to their defense icon. · This is the die that the hero rolls when defending against an attack.
» Each hero card displays a hero's four stats and the success modifier for each of those stats.
· Each stat's modifier indicates how many successes are added to or subtracted from a roll during a test of that stat. » Each hero card displays a hero's armor restrictions.
· A hero cannot equip armor of a weight that is not presented on their hero card.
· For example, if a hero card only has the word 'Heavy,' that hero can equip only heavy armor.
» Each hero card is double-sided. A hero can flip their hero card to its other side by performing a ready action. · Other game effects may allow a hero to flip their hero card.

Hero Defense
Before suffering damage during an attack, a hero defends to reduce the amount of damage they suffer.
» To defend, the hero rolls the die that is displayed next to their defense icon on their hero card. Then, they may resolve each die icon as follows:
· success (   ): The hero can spend each success (   ) result to reduce the damage they would suffer by one.
· advantage (   ): The hero can place fatigue tokens to convert one advantage (   ) result to one success (   ) result for each fatigue token that is placed.
· surge (  ):The hero can spend surge (   ) results to resolve surge abilities.
» During a hero's defense, their equipped armor may provide them with automatic success (   ) results or additional dice to roll.

42
· If a hero's armor card has a value and success icon presented next to a defense icon, that armor provides a number of automatic successes equal to that value. These successes are in addition to any provided from dice results.
· A hero can spend these automatic successes identically to a success produced by their roll. » After the hero defends, they suffer all remaining damage.
· To suffer damage, the hero rotates their health dial to decrease their health by the amount of damage suffered. · If a hero's health ever is reduced to zero, they are wounded.
» If the timing of an ability uses the word 'defense,' that ability is referring to the event that begins when a hero rolls a die to reduce damage and ends after the hero suffers any remaining damage.

Hero Movement
Typically, a hero moves by spending their movement points during their turn; however, other game effects can allow a hero to move as well.
























» When a hero moves, they move from the space they currently occupy to an adjacent space.
· A hero can move from a space of higher elevation to a space of lower elevation if those spaces are treated as adjacent (see adjacency and elevation and staircases).
· A hero can move from a space of lower elevation up to a space on a staircase or from a space on a staircase up to a space of higher elevation if those spaces are treated as adjacent.
» A hero can move in the following ways:
· A hero can move one space by spending one of their movement points. · A hero can move if an effect instructs them to.
· If a hero resolves an ability that has the 'Shift' keyword, that hero can move up to the number of spaces that correspond to that keyword.
· For example, if an ability allows a hero to 'Shift 2,' that hero can move zero, one, or two spaces. » When a hero moves, they must obey the following rules:
· A hero must move into an adjacent space.
· A hero cannot move into a space that contains 3D terrain.
· A hero cannot move into a space that contains an enemy figure. · A hero can move into a space that contains a token.
· A hero can move into a space that contains a hero figure, but only if they can move out of that space immediately. In other words, a hero can move through a space that contains another hero.
» A hero is impeded if they are adjacent to an enemy.
» If a hero moves into an ember, poison or spike underlay, they suffer the effect of that underlay.
» To move out of a space of a water underlay, the hero must spend one additional movement point.


43
Hero Turn
Each hero can take up to one turn during each Hero Phase. During a hero's turn, that hero can perform one maneuver action and two additional actions.
» The party chooses the order in which heroes take their turns, and this order can change from round to round. » While a hero is taking their turn, the following rules apply:
· A hero can perform the same action multiple times. · A hero does not have to perform all of their actions.
· A hero can resolve other effects, including spending movement points, between actions.
· After a hero has performed all of their actions, that hero can still resolve abilities and spend movement points.
· If a hero wishes to resolve an ability that is prefaced by a '2  ,' that hero must spend both of their non-maneuver actions to do so. That is, if a hero resolves an ability prefaced by a '2  ,' the only action that a hero can perform during that turn is a maneuver action.
» After all heroes have completed their turns, the hero phase ends and the round proceeds to the Darkness Phase.

Hero Figures
If a hero has multiple figures, they may freely choose which of their figures they use to represent their hero on the map.

ID Marker
Each enemy in play has an ID marker that consists of a color and one to four notches. An enemy's ID marker distinguishes that enemy from other enemies of the same type.

» When the app instructs a player to place an enemy on the map, the app assigns that enemy an ID marker.












· Before placing an enemy figure on the map, an ID marker is inserted into that figure's base. The inserted ID marker should match the color that was assigned to that enemy.
























44





























· If players cannot distinguish an enemy by its color, they should distinguish an enemy by the number of notches that are exposed on the enemy's bar and ID marker.
» Each enemy bar in the app displays that enemy's image as well as its ID marker.
» The enemy overview screen in the app displays each enemy figure and its ID marker.

Unique Enemies
Unique enemies are singular figures that do not use ID markers. Only one of each such enemy figure can be on the map at any given time.
» Unique enemies are displayed in the app with a white enemy tab.

Impede
Heroes and enemies can become impeded making it more difficult for them to move.



















45




















» A hero is impeded if they are adjacent to an enemy and the difference in elevation between them is one level or less. » If a hero is impeded when they perform a maneuver action, they only gain one movement point.
» If a hero becomes impeded during their turn, they lose all of their unspent movement points.
» An enemy is impeded if they are adjacent to a hero and the difference in elevation between them is one level or less. » If an enemy becomes impeded during their activation, they lose all of their unspent movement points.
· An enemy will become impeded only if doing so best satisfies its other targeting and movement criteria (e.g., allowing the enemy to attack its highest-priority target). After satisfying all other criteria, if the enemy can end its movement in a space that does not cause it to become impeded, it prefers that space to a space that does cause it to become impeded.
» Being impeded or becoming impeded only cause a hero or enemy to lose movement points, it does not affect other abilities or effects that may allow a hero or enemy to move.
· If a game effect allows an impeded hero or enemy to move without spending a movement point, that hero or enemy ignores the effects of impede.
· If a game effect allows a hero or enemy to move without spending movement points and they become impeded during that movement, that hero or enemy ignores the effects of being impeded.

Interrupt
The enemy activation screen has an 'Interrupt' button that the heroes can select if they need to resolve effects that occur before or during an enemy activation or between two different enemy activations.

» When a hero selects the 'Interrupt' button, the enemy activation screen closes, giving heroes access to the game's main screens.
» When the heroes are ready to resume an enemy's activation, they select the 'Resume Activation' button.

Inventory
The party's inventory contains all of the materials, gold, and equipment that the heroes have gained.

» Heroes can access the party inventory at any time through the party menu.
» The party inventory screen tracks and displays the party's materials, gold, armor, consumables, trinkets, and weapon parts. · When the party gains any of these, they are automatically added to their inventory.
· The party shares all recipes, materials, gold, and equipment. Though, some equipment can only be used by specific heroes. » It is recommended that the party maintains a physical inventory of cards for all of the armor, consumables, trinkets, and weapons they have gained as well as any skills they have unlocked.
· Materials, gold, and secondary weapon parts only exist in the app.





46
Keywords
A keyword is a shorthand for frequently used abilities that can appear on cards and in the app. Both hero and enemy abilities use keywords.

» A keyword is presented on cards and within ability text in a small caps font. » Keywords include the following: Charge, Reach, Reveal, and shift.

Charge
Charge is a keyword that adds condition tokens to a card when that card is flipped. The charge keyword is always presented with the name of a type of condition token and a value.
» After a card is flipped, if the faceup side of that card has the charge keyword, the type and number of tokens specified by the keyword are placed on the card. When there are no tokens of that type on that card, that card is flipped.
· During setup, if a hero places a card in their play area and the faceup side of that that card has the charge keyword, the hero resolves that keyword.
· After the last token of the type specified by the keyword is removed from the card, that card must be flipped. When the card is flipped, all other tokens are removed from that card as normal.
» If a game effect would instruct a hero to place a condition token on a card that already has a token of that type, the card cannot gain that condition, even if that condition is the one associated with the Charge keyword.
· A hero can only place more than one condition token of the same type on the same card when they are resolving the charge keyword.
» A hero can spend tokens that were placed on a card by the charge keyword as normal.

Reach
Reach is a keyword found on weapons. This keyword allows a hero to perform an attack against an enemy that is up to two spaces away.
» An attack performed using a weapon with the reach keyword is a melee attack, even if the attacking hero is not adjacent to the enemy they are attacking.
» A hero must have line of sight to the enemy they are attacking if they wish to perform an attack from a position that is not adjacent to that enemy.

Reveal
Reveal is a keyword that forces heroes to resolve effects when cards are flipped. The reveal keyword is always presented with an effect.
» After a hero flips a card, if the faceup side of that card has the reveal keyword, the hero must immediately resolve that keyword's effect.
· During setup, if a hero places a card in their play area and the faceup side of that card has the reveal keyword, the hero resolves that keyword's effect.

Shift
Shift is a keyword that allows a hero or enemy to move. The shift keyword is always presented with a value, which indicates the maximum number of spaces a figure can move when resolving that keyword.
» To resolve the shift keyword, the figure (enemy or hero) that is specified by the ability can move up to the number of spaces indicated.
» When a figure resolves a shift to move, that figure ignores the rules of impeding, but it still obeys all terrain rules.
» Because the shift keyword allows a hero to move without spending movement points, that movement is not affected by water spaces.

Defeat (Keyword)
Defeat is a keyword on companion cards.
» When an enemy attack deals damage to a companion that equals or exceeds that companion’s health, if the faceup side of that companion’s card has the defeat keyword, the controlling hero must immediately resolve that keyword’s effect.

Stack
Stack is a keyword on some of Kehli’s skills that tell her how to place contraptions on the map.
» When Kehli is instructed to stack a contraption, she places that contraption on top of another contraption that is already in play.


47






· Until one or more of those stacked contraptions are removed, they are treated as a single piece of terrain. · If an effect moves a stacked contraption, all contraptions in the stack also move.

Technique
Technique is a keyword that adds additional effects to an ability based on the hero’s attack card.
» When a hero activates an ability with technique, they may activate an additional effect if their attack card has the indicated damage type.
· If the hero’s attack card has multiple damage types that could be used to activate more than one additional technique effect, they choose one of those effects to activate.
· An attack card has all the damage types printed on the card, as well as any additional damage types granted by abilities on the hero’s equipped trinket.

Line of Sight
Line of sight refers to what a figure can see. To perform an attack, the attacking figure must have line of sight to the figure that is being attacked.

» During a quest, the app's option menu contains a line of sight tool that players can use to determine line of sight for them.


















» To use the line of sight tool, a player opens the tool and selects any space on the map. Then, the tool highlights all spaces that are in line of sight of the selected space.
· Red highlighted spaces are adjacent to the selected space.
· Orange highlighted spaces are two spaces away from the selected space.
· Yellow highlighted spaces are three or more spaces away from the selected space. · If a space is not highlighted, it is not in line of sight of the selected space.
» To determine line of sight without using the line of sight tool, a player traces an imaginary line from the center of a figure's space to the center of another figure's space.
· If the line is interrupted by map edges or spaces that contain blocking terrain, line of sight is blocked. · If line of sight is not blocked, the figures have line of sight to each other.
» Figures do not block line of sight.
» The corners of spaces do not block line of sight.
For the purposes of line of sight, there are two types of terrain: blocking and non-blocking. Blocking terrain blocks line of sight. Blocking terrain includes the following:
» Archway
· Only the two pillars of the archway block line of sight.

48
» Bells » Doors
» Dragon Statue
» Pillars (Short and Tall)
· If a pillar does not occupy a space but is either placed off the map to support a higher map level or is placed on the lines between spaces, that pillar does not block line of sight.
» Shelves » Shrines » Statues » Trees
Non-blocking terrain does not block line of sight. Non-blocking terrain includes the following: » Barricades
» Bridges
» Cauldrons » Chests
» Contraptions » Fires
» Gates
» Ladders (Short and Tall) » Lecterns
» Stairways
» Tables (Large and Small) » Wagons
» Wells

Line of Sight and Elevation
Heroes can trace line of sight up and down elevation.
» To determine line of sight between levels, heroes can imagine that all map tiles were on the same level.




















· It may help to view the map from the top, looking down.











49



















» When determining line of sight across map tiles that are higher than level one, a hero can trace line of sight off of a map tile edge, if the portion of the line that is off that edge is over a space on a lower level.


































» For determining line of sight between figures that are under overhangs, see overhangs.




50
Maneuver Action
The maneuver action is an action that provides a hero with movement points, which allows them to move during their turn.

» When a hero performs a maneuver action, they gain a number of movement points equal to their speed. · If a hero is impeded when they perform a maneuver action, they only gain one movement point.
· A hero's speed is presented as a value on their hero card next to their speed icon.
» A hero has resolved a maneuver action after they have gained their movement points. The act of moving a hero is not part of the maneuver action.
» A hero can spend movement points between actions during their turn, and any movement points not spent are lost when the hero ends their turn.

Map
The map is made up of map tiles, underlays, terrain, and tokens.

» During a quest, the app instructs players when and how to create the map.
· Each map tile has a unique code printed on it. When creating the map, the app references a tile's code to help players identify the correct map tiles.












































51
























































Materials
Materials are used to craft and upgrade equipment.

52
» Materials only exist in the app, and they can be found during quests and purchased at the shop using gold. » When a hero gains a material, it is are automatically added to the party inventory.
» Materials are shared by the party and can be viewed in the party inventory at any time through the party menu.

Melee Attacks
A melee attack is any attack made by a hero using a weapon that does not have a range value or any attack made by an enemy that does not have a range value on their activation screen.

» When resolving a melee attack, the attacking figure must typically be adjacent to the figure that is being attacked. However, some game effects, such as the reach keyword, allow melee attacks to be resolved against a figure that is not adjacent.
» If a hero using a weapon that has a range value attacks an adjacent enemy, that attack is ranged attack, not a melee attack.
» If an enemy's activation screen has a range value and that enemy attacks an adjacent target, that attack is a ranged attack, not a melee attack
» If two spaces at different elevations of one level or less would share a border or corner if they were at the same elevation, those spaces are treated as adjacent for the purposes of melee attacks.

Movement
Heroes and enemies can both move between the spaces on the board.

Negating
The app may grant a hero the chance to negate damage or fatigue before they suffer it.

» If a hero is provided a chance to negate damage or fatigue, the app presents the hero with a stat to test and indicates that the stat 'negates.' Then, the hero may perform a test of that stat.
· Example: 'Each hero suffers 4 damage; might negates.'
» When testing a stat to negate, each success (   ) produced during that test prevents one damage (   ) or fatigue (  ). · A hero applies modifiers for the stat as indicated on their hero card as normal.
· Other game effects can modify these successes.

Objectives
Each quest has its own objectives that are displayed at the top of the map screen. Each objective describes how the party completes it.

» The app tracks all progress made toward a quest's objectives and updates that objective or provides new objectives as necessary.
· Players can access the quest log from the options menu to view any changes or updates to their current quest's objectives that they may have missed.
» If the heroes complete the final objective of a quest, the heroes win and the quest ends. » If the final objective cannot be completed, the heroes lose and the quest ends.
· The heroes still progress to the next quest if they lose. However, the outcome of the quest may affect future quests and other aspects of the campaign.

Overhangs
An overhang is a portion of a tile that exists one or more levels directly above another tile.














53
» Both heroes and enemies can move into a space that is underneath an overhang.
· If a figure is too large to fit under an overhang—that is, if the figure cannot stand normally without touching the tile above it—that figure cannot move or be moved into that space.

Overhangs and Line of Sight
Overhangs may or may not block line of sight between two figures.
» To determine line of sight to or from a figure that is under an overhang, line of sight must be drawn through at least one space that meets the following criteria:



















· The space is on the same level as the figure that is under the overhang. · The space is not under an overhang.
» Players are encouraged to use the line of sight tool in the app if it is difficult to determine line of sight.

Overhangs and Range
When determining range between two components (or spaces) on different levels, heroes count range through adjacent spaces as normal.
» If two spaces at different elevations would share a border if they were at the same elevation, those spaces are treated as adjacent for the purposes of determining range.
» When counting spaces to determine the range for effects or ranged attacks, range can be counted up and down elevation ignoring levels. However, range cannot be counted through a tile—from a tile's facedown side to its faceup side or vice versa (see overhangs).






















54
» When counting spaces to determine the range for effects or ranged attacks, range can be counted up and down elevation ignoring levels. However, range cannot be counted through a tile—from a tile's facedown side to its faceup side or vice versa (see overhangs).

Party
Party is the collective term for all of the heroes.

» The party shares all of their inventory and should make decisions as a group throughout the campaign.

Player
Each person playing the game is a player.

» During a quest, each player controls a single hero. The hero that a player controls can change from quest to quest. · When playing a solo game, a player controls multiple heroes.
» Rules may refer to a player as a hero. The term 'player' and 'hero' are interchangeable in rules text.

Quests
The Blood and Fire campaign is divided into a series of quests. Each quest is a scenario that can be played during a single game session.

» Quests are presented as nodes on the campaign map screen. There are two types of quests, as follows:
· Campaign Quests: These quests progress the campaign's story whether the heroes win or lose. These quests often focus on a specific hero.








· Side Quests: These quests are optional but offer additional rewards that can help strengthen the heroes.








» Players can select a quest from the campaign map screen to view information about that quest.
» When the players are ready to play a quest, they choose a quest from the campaign map screen, select their heroes, and then select the 'Prepare' button.
· Players may choose a different arrangement of heroes for each quest, but many quests indicate a required hero that must be chosen as hero for that quest.

Ending a Quest
The app indicates to the heroes when a quest has ended. When a quest ends, the heroes either win or lose, and the app displays a summary screen of various statistics about the quest, including the XP, materials, and items the heroes gained.
» If the heroes complete the final objective of a quest, the heroes win and the quest ends.
· The app tracks all progress made toward a quest's objectives and updates that objective or provides new objectives as necessary.
· Players can access the quest log from the options menu to view any changes or updates to their current quest's objectives that they may have missed.
» If the final objective cannot be completed, the heroes lose and the quest ends. » If a hero that has a major injury is wounded, the heroes lose and the quest ends.


55
» The heroes progress to the next quest whether they win or lose. However, the outcome of the quest may affect future quests and other aspects of the campaign.
» After the quest, return all consumable and injury cards to the supply.

Starting a Quest
Before each quest, create the supply by sorting the following components and placing them nearby: · Consumable Cards
· Injury Cards
· Enemy Figures · Map Tiles
· Terrain · Tokens
Each hero chooses which skills, legends, and equipment cards to equip. Each hero gathers the following components and creates their play area: » Their hero card and figure
» Their equipped cards
· Each hero can begin the game with either side of their hero card, skill cards, and attack cards faceup. » A health dial set to their hero’s maximum health value.

Range
Range is a measurement between two components (or spaces) on the map. Ranged attacks and certain abilities require a hero to determine range.

» To determine range between two components, a player counts the spaces from one component to the other.































· The player counts contiguous, adjacent spaces along the shortest path between the two components.
· The player begins counting in a space that is adjacent to the component that the player is counting from and stops counting in the space that is occupied by the component that the player is counting to.
· A player cannot count range through spaces that contain blocking terrain.

56
· A player can count range through all other terrain, figures, and components.

Range and Overhangs
When determining range between two components (or spaces) on different levels, heroes count range through adjacent spaces as normal.
» If two spaces at different elevations would share a border if they were at the same elevation, those spaces are treated as adjacent for the purposes of determining range.
» When counting spaces to determine the range for effects or ranged attacks, range can be counted up and down elevation ignoring levels. However, range cannot be counted through a tile—from a tile's facedown side to its faceup side or vice versa (see overhangs).




















Ranged Attacks
If a weapon has a range value, an attack made using that weapon is a ranged attack. If an enemy's activation screen has a range value, an attack made by that enemy is a ranged attack.







» If a hero is using a weapon that has a range value to attack an enemy, that enemy can be up to a number of spaces away from that hero equal that weapon's range value.
· In addition to being within range, the enemy must also be in line of sight for the hero to be able to attack it.
» The range value on an enemy activation screen indicates the maximum number of spaces away from the target that the activating enemy can be to perform an attack against that target. Additionally, this value is the range from the target that the enemy prefers to be at after it has finished moving.
· In addition to being within range, the target must also be in line of sight for the enemy to be able to attack it.

Recipes
Recipes are used to craft and upgrade equipment. Each recipe is for a unique piece of equipment and indicates the number and type of materials required to craft or upgrade that equipment.









57






























» There are two recipes for each piece of equipment that can be crafted—one to create the standard version of the equipment and one to improve that equipment to its upgraded version.
· To craft or upgrade equipment, a hero must visit the crafthall and spend a recipe and all the materials required by that recipe.
» Recipes can be found during quests and can be awarded for completing feats.

Resistances
Some enemies have a resistance to one or more specific damage types. When an enemy would suffer damage of a type that it is resistant to, the amount of damage the enemy suffers is reduced.

» Each damage type that an enemy is resistant to is displayed as a “?” until that resistance is revealed.


















58
· The first time an enemy suffers damage of a type that they are resistant to, that resistance is revealed for the duration of the campaign.
» During a hero’s attack, for each success a hero spends, the enemy suffers one less damage for each of the weapon's damage types that the enemy is resistant to.
· This damage modification is calculated automatically by the app.
» On Heroic and Warfare difficulty, each enemy type gains one additional resistance.

Setup
This section contains instructions for setting up a new campaign and continuing an existing campaign.

Continuing a Campaign
To begin a new session of a campaign that is already in progress, players perform the following steps in order:
1. Launch App: Players launch the Descent: Legends of the Dark app and select 'Load Game' followed by the saved campaign they wish to resume.
2. Create Supply: Separate all tokens by type and place them in piles to create the supply. Place the map tiles, terrain, enemy figures, consumable cards, and injury cards in the supply—the injury and consumable cards do not need to be shuffled.
If the heroes saved their game between quests, they can gather their hero components while preparing for their next quest.

Preparing for a Quest
After selecting a quest on the campaign map screen, each player must select their hero, select their hero loadout, and then place their hero card, reference card, health dial, and all cards that correspond to the equipment they are using for this quest in their play area.
» A hero must select their weapons and trinket in the app. Then, they can choose to equip the following: · one armor
· three consumables
· skill cards with XP costs that do not exceed their total XP.
» The party can change their difficulty setting on the hero loadout screen before the quest begins.

Starting a Campaign
To set up a campaign, players perform the following steps in order:
1. Launch App: Players launch the Descent: Legends of the Dark app and select 'New Game.' The app guides players through a series of screens to create a save slot, select a difficulty setting, and choose their starting characters.
» When creating a new campaign, the app presents the choice to begin with Act I, Blood and Flame, or to start directly with Act II, The Betrayer’s War.
Other than selecting a save slot, none of these choices are permanent. Players can adjust the difficulty setting at any time, and they can play different characters over the course of the campaign.
» Single Player: If playing a single-player game, the player chooses and controls two heroes, but all other rules remain the same.
2. Gather Hero Components: Each player takes a reference card, a health dial, the plastic figure and hero card that match the hero they chose in the app, and that hero's two starting weapon cards, as follows:
» Brynn: Warden's Blade, Weighted Warhammer » Galaden: Bloodwood Bow, Mirror Blades
» Syrus: Crook'd Staff, Glimmering Wand
» Vaerix: Ironthorn Warbell, Riverwatch Spear
Each player combines their starting weapons by placing one weapon on top of the other. The faces that have the upgrade icon should face each other so they are not visible (see attack cards). Then, the pair of cards is inserted into a card sleeve and treated as a single attack card during the game.
Then, each player sets up a play area in front of them where they place their gathered components. A hero can begin the game with either side of their hero card and attack card faceup.
3. Set Health Dial: Each player sets their health dial to the number that matches the maximum health value on their hero card.
4. Create Supply: Separate all tokens by type and place them in piles to create the supply. Place the map tiles, terrain, enemy figures, consumable cards, and injury cards in the supply—the injury and consumable cards do not need to be shuffled. Return all other cards to the game box, as they are not used during the first quest.


59
5. Create the Starting Map: Follow the app's instructions to set up the first map, placing map tiles, tokens, terrain, and figures.
A unique code is printed on each map tile to make it easy to find the correct tiles. Leave room in the play area to place additional map tiles during the game.

Shop
The shop is a location in the city where heroes buy and sell materials. To visit the shop, a hero selects the shop icon on the city map screen.

















» Each material is available to purchase at the shop in limited quantities.
· The shop's quantity of available materials refreshes after the party travels. » A random assortment of recipes is available to purchase at the shop.
· The available recipes refresh after the party travels.
» There is a rare chance that equipment is available to purchase at the shop. » Heroes can sell materials from their inventory to the shop.

Sight Tokens
Sight tokens are placed on the map and represent points of interest. As heroes approach them, they can expand the map, reveal new details, or trigger traps.









» When a hero moves into or adjacent to a space that contains a sight token, they must activate the sight token immediately.
· A hero must activate the sight token before performing any other actions, resolving any other abilities, or spending more movement points.
· A game effect can cause a hero to move into a space in which a sight token must be activated; activating that sight token interrupts that game effect.
· For example, if a hero shifts two spaces but the first space they move through would activate a sight token, they must activate that sight token before resolving the rest of their shift.
» To activate a sight token, a hero selects and drags from their hero portrait to that sight token in the app. Then, the hero follows the instructions that the app provides.
· Activating a sight token does not use an action.

Single-Player Game
If playing a single-player game, the player chooses and controls two heroes, but all other rules remain the same.


60
» The single player controls each hero separately, following the game rules as if each hero was controlled by a different player.

Skills
Skills provide a hero with a variety of abilities. Each hero has their own unique skills that they unlock throughout the campaign. A hero can view the skills they have unlocked in party menu.

































» Each skill card is double-sided and has a unique ability on each side.
» To resolve an ability on a skill card, the hero reads the text and follows its instructions. · An ability must be on the faceup side of the skill card for it to be used.
» A hero can flip their skill card so its other side is faceup by performing a ready action. · Other game effects may allow a hero to flip their skill card.
» Heroes can place condition and fatigue tokens on skill cards.
» Each skill card has a fatigue limit that indicates the maximum number of fatigue tokens that can be on that card at the same time.

Equipping Skills
Before a quest, when each hero is selecting their weapons and trinket in the hero loadout screen, they can choose to equip any number of their skills.
» The combined cost of a hero's equipped skills cannot exceed the hero's XP.
· Heroes can view their XP in the hero skills screen that is accessible from the party menu.

Speed
Speed is a stat that is presented on a hero's card and on an enemy's activation screen.





61






» When a hero performs a maneuver action, they gain a number of movement points equal to their speed.
· If the hero is impeded when they perform a maneuver action, they gain only one movement point instead. » When an enemy activates, it gains a number of movement points equal to its speed.
· If the enemy is impeded when it activates, it gains only one movement point instead.

Statuses
Enemy statuses are negative effects that are tracked by the app.

» If an effect causes an enemy to suffer a status, the party must select the checkbox that corresponds to that status in that enemy's information screen.
· A checked status indicates that the enemy has that status.

















» An enemy cannot suffer a status that it already has.
· If an effect causes an enemy to suffer a status that it already has, that portion of the effect is ignored.
» Enemy statuses are resolved automatically by the app and are removed by the app at the end of each round. · Percentage calculations for enemy statuses are rounded up.
· Some game effects may cause an enemy status to persist into the next game round.
» An effect that causes an enemy to suffer a status uses the verb form of that status—afflict, daze, doom, enfeeble, expose, or slow.

Afflicted
Afflicted is an enemy status. Attacks can apply this status to an enemy automatically. If another game effect would cause an enemy to suffer the afflicted status, players select the 'Afflicted' checkbox in that enemy's information screen. » During the darkness phase, each afflicted enemy suffers four damage.
· This damage is applied automatically by the app.
» The afflicted status is removed from each enemy at the end of each game round unless another effect allows it to persist.
» Effects that cause an enemy to suffer the afflicted status use word 'afflict.' For example, 'Then afflict that enemy.'

Dazed
Dazed is an enemy status. Attacks can apply this status to an enemy automatically. If another game effect would cause an enemy to suffer the dazed status, players select the 'Dazed' checkbox in that enemy's information screen.
» When a hero attacks a dazed enemy, the secondary abilities on the hero's weapon are 10% more likely to be used. · The effects of secondary abilities are applied automatically.


62
» The dazed status is removed from each enemy at the end of each game round unless another effect allows it to persist.
» Effects that cause an enemy to suffer the dazed status use word 'daze.' For example, 'Then daze that enemy.'

Doomed
Doomed is an enemy status. Attacks can apply this status to an enemy automatically. If another game effect would cause an enemy to become doomed, players select the 'Doomed' checkbox in that enemy's information screen.
» At the end of the round, a doomed enemy's 'Doomed' status is removed, but all of its other statuses remain on the enemy for another round.
» Effects that cause an enemy to suffer the doomed status use word 'doom.' For example, 'Then doom that enemy.'

Enfeebled
Enfeebled is an enemy status. Attacks can apply this status to an enemy automatically. If another game effect would cause an enemy to suffer the enfeebled status, players select the 'Enfeebled' checkbox in that enemy's information screen.
» An enfeebled enemy's attack damage is reduced by 20%.
· This reduction of damage is applied automatically by the app. · Percentage calculations are rounded up.
» The enfeebled status is removed from each enemy at the end of each game round unless another effect allows it to persist.
» Effects that cause an enemy to suffer the enfeebled status use word 'enfeeble.' For example, 'Then enfeeble that enemy.'

Exposed
Exposed is an enemy status. Attacks can apply this status to an enemy automatically. If another game effect would cause an enemy to suffer the exposed status, players select the 'Exposed' checkbox in that enemy's information screen. » An exposed enemy suffers 20% more damage from attacks.
· This increase in damage is applied automatically by the app. · Percentage calculations are rounded up.
» The exposed status is removed from each enemy at the end of each game round unless another effect allows it to persist.
» Effects that cause an enemy to suffer the exposed status use word 'expose.' For example, 'Then expose that enemy.'

Slowed
Slowed is an enemy status. Attacks can apply this status to an enemy automatically. If another game effect would cause an enemy to suffer the slowed status, players select the 'Slowed' checkbox in that enemy's information screen.
» A slowed enemy's speed is reduced to one.
· This reduction in speed is applied automatically by the app and is displayed during that enemy's activation.
» The slowed status is removed from each enemy at the end of each game round unless another effect allows it to persist.
» Effects that cause an enemy to suffer the slowed status use word 'slow.' For example, 'Then slow that enemy.'

Confused
Confused is an enemy status. Attacks can apply this status to an enemy automatically. If another game effect would cause an enemy to suffer the confused status, players can manually select the 'Confused' checkbox in the enemy’s information screen.
» When a confused enemy activates, it performs an alternate activation. · This activation is automatically determined by the app.
· The enemy’s normal activation is cancelled.
» The confused status is removed from each enemy at the end of the round, unless another effect allows it to persist. » Effects that cause an enemy to suffer the confused status use the word 'confuse.' For example, 'Then confuse that enemy.'

Success (   )
Success (   ) is a die result that a hero can spend when rolling dice—typically when resolving an attack, defense, or test.

» During an attack, a hero spends success (   ) results to increase the amount of damage an enemy suffers.


63
· When a hero is attacking an enemy, for each success (   ) a hero inputs into the app, that enemy suffers an amount of damage equal to the damage value on the weapon being used for that attack.
» During a defense, a hero spends success (   ) results to decrease the amount of damage they suffer.
· Success (   ): The hero can spend each success (   ) result to reduce the damage they would suffer by one. » During a test, a hero spends success (   ) results to increase their chances of passing that test.

Surge (  )
Surge (  ) is a die result that a hero can spend after rolling dice—typically during an attack, defense, or test—to resolve a surge ability.

Surge Abilities
A surge ability is any ability that is prefaced by a surge (   ) icon. Many cards have surge abilities, including all hero cards. » A hero can use their surge abilities any time they roll a die.
» To use a surge ability, a hero spends a surge icon from one of their die results and then resolves the ability's effect by reading its text and following the instructions.
» Each surge ability can be used only once per roll (typically an attack, defense, or test).
» A hero can spend multiple surge (   ) results after a roll; however, each surge ability can be used only once per roll (typically an attack, defense, or test).

Terrain
Terrain represents natural elements, such as water, lava, and trees, as well as objects such as treasure chests, shelves, and gates. Terrain is represented either as 3D punchboard or as an underlay.

» By performing an explore action, a hero can interact with any 3D terrain that they are adjacent to.
· To perform the explore action, the hero selects and drags their portrait in the app to the 3D terrain that they wish to interact with. Then, the hero follows the instructions that the app provides.
» A hero can select any 3D terrain in the app to view a prompt that provides information about that terrain. · Selecting 3D terrain in this way is not an action. A hero can select 3D terrain at any time.

Barricades
Unlike other 3D terrain, a barricade has a unique rule that makes it dangerous for both heroes and enemies to position themselves too close to it.















» If a hero attacks an enemy that is adjacent to a barricade, the hero adds one success (   ) to their attack. » If an enemy attacks a hero who is adjacent to a barricade, the enemy adds one damage (   ) to its attack.

Staircases
A staircase is a type of terrain that allows a hero to move upward between two levels of elevation. Each staircase connects a lower level of the map to an upper level of the map. A staircase consists of three steps, each with two spaces.
» The spaces of a staircase are adjacent to other spaces on that staircase that they would share a border with if they were at the same elevation.



64
» The spaces on the bottom and middle steps are between the elevation level of the lower and upper levels that the staircase connects. These spaces are adjacent to any spaces on those upper and lower levels that they would share a border with if they were at the same elevation.





















































» The spaces on the top step are at the same elevation level as the upper level that the staircase connects to. As such, those spaces are subject to all the normal rules of elevation.




65

























» Some maps are constructed with a map tile resting on the top step of a staircase. The spaces resting on the top step are treated as part of that step.
» If a large enemy figure ends its movement so that a portion of its base hangs off a staircase step, a riser is placed under the unsupported part of the figure to prevent it from tilting.

Terrain and Line of Sight
When determining line of sight between two components, if the line is interrupted by a space that contains blocking terrain, line of sight is blocked.



























66

























Blocking terrain blocks line of sight. Blocking terrain includes the following: » Archway
· Only the two pillars of the archway block line of sight. » Bells
» Doors
» Dragon Statue
» Pillars (Short and Tall)
· If a pillar does not occupy a space but is either placed off the map to support a higher map level or is placed on the lines between spaces, that pillar does not block line of sight.
» Shelves » Shrines » Statues » Trees
Non-blocking terrain does not block line of sight. Non-blocking terrain includes the following: » Barricades
» Bridges
» Cauldrons » Chests
» Contraptions » Fires
» Gates
» Ladders (Short and Tall) » Lecterns
» Staircases
» Tables (Large and Small) » Wagons
» Wells

Terrain and Movement
Heroes and enemies cannot move into a space that contains a piece of 3D terrain unless a rule or effect specifically states otherwise, such as the rules for staircases.
» Figures can move diagonally between two spaces that contain 3D terrain.

67































Underlays
Underlays are a type of terrain that is printed on sheets and is placed partially under map tiles. When placing this terrain, it is important that only the spaces shown in the app are exposed.
» Underlays are treated as extensions of the map tiles that are placed on top of them. An underlay space shares a border—and is therefore adjacent to—any abutting space on that map tile.
» Underlays are treated as if they are on the same level as the map tiles that are placed on top of them. » The heroes can select an underlay in the app to view information about it.
» Heroes and enemies can move into spaces of underlays normally as if the underlays were extensions of the map tiles that are placed on top of them.
» Each type of underlay has unique effects for both heroes and enemies.

Embers
Ember underlays affect a figure each time that figure enters one of its spaces.













» If a hero moves into an ember space, they scar one of their cards.

68
» If an enemy moves into an ember space, the enemy becomes afflicted and doomed.

Poison
Poison underlays affect a figure each time that figure enters one of its spaces.













» If a hero moves into a poison space, they Infect one of their cards.
» If an enemy moves into a poison space, that enemy becomes enfeebled.

Spikes
Spike underlays affect a figure each time that figure enters one of its spaces.













» If a hero or enemy moves into a spike space, they become impeded and suffer two damage.

Water
Water underlays affect a figure each time that figure exits one of its spaces.













» When spending movement points to move out of a water space, a hero or enemy must spend one additional movement point.
» If an effect allows a hero to move without spending movement points, that movement is not affected by water spaces.





69
Contraptions
A contraption is a special type of 3D terrain that is not tracked in the app and heroes cannot interact with contraptions. Several of Kehli’s new skills allow her to place contraptions on the map, and those skills define what effects and abilities those contraptions have, in addition to the properties defined here.
» Contraptions are terrain, and cannot share a space with figures, tokens, or other terrain pieces. » Contraptions block movement, but do not block line of sight.
» If an enemy figure would be placed in a space with a contraption, the heroes move the contraption to the nearest empty space of their choice.

Fire
Unlike most other 3D terrain, fire has an additional effect that allows heroes and enemies alike to make their attacks more damaging.
» If a hero adjacent to a fire attacks an enemy, that hero adds 1 success (   ) to their attack.
» If an enemy adjacent to a fire attacks a hero or companion, that enemy adds 1 damage (   ) to its attack.
» Additionally, the number of fires on the map can increase the amount of damage that afflicted enemies suffer during the darkness phase, as indicated by the app.

Burning Terrain
Free-standing fire terrain can be placed during the quest, or fire can be added to other terrain pieces, creating burning terrain. (For example, a barricade with fire attached to it is a “burning barricade.')















» When instructed by the app to add fire to terrain, attach a fire piece to the indicated terrain as shown in the app.
» Burning terrain pieces have alternate interactions available and are considered to be fire for all purposes.

Ladders
Figures can use ladders to move between different levels of elevation.
» When a figure moves, they may use two movement points to move from a space adjacent to a ladder to another space adjacent to a ladder, ignoring elevation.

















70


























» When a figure Shifts, they may spend two spaces of that movement to use a ladder.

Tests
When heroes interact with terrain and explore tokens on the map, they often are instructed to perform a test.

Each test requires a hero to use one of the stats that is displayed on their hero card: might, agility, insight, or will. Each stat can have a positive (+) or negative (–) modifier that is applied to all tests of that stat.
To perform a test, a hero performs the following steps in order: 1. Roll Dice: The hero rolls two black dice.
The hero can convert advantage to success by placing fatigue, as normal.
2. Apply Modifier: The hero applies the modifier on their hero card for that stat to the number of successes they rolled. » If the modifier is positive, they add that modifier to their number of successes.
» If the modifier is negative, they subtract that modifier from their number of successes. » Some game effects can provide further modifiers or alter the number of successes.
3. Provide Input: The hero inputs either inputs the number of successes into the app or selects 'Pass or 'Fail' as appropriate. Then, the app provides the heroes with the outcome of the test.
» Some tests require the hero to input the number of successes in the app.
» The successes for some tests are cumulative and may take multiple attempts to succeed—the heroes can perform these tests multiple times, and the app tracks the total number of successes between attempts.
» Some tests provide a number that indicates how many successes are required to pass the test (e.g., 'Test might 6'). If the hero has successes equal to or greater than the required number, they pass the test and select 'Pass' in the app. Otherwise, they fail the test and select 'Fail' in the app.

Traits
Many cards contain traits such as 'Leadership' or 'Spear' that are presented below their card name. Traits have no inherent effects; however, other game effects may refer to cards that have those traits.

» If an effect is referencing a card with a trait, it is only referencing the faceup side of that card.




71
Trinkets
Trinkets, which are represented by trinket cards, can provide a hero with a variety of passive abilities during a quest.





















» Each trinket card has two sides. One side is the standard version of the trinket, and the other side is the upgraded version of the trinket.
· An upgraded trinket is indicated by an upgrade icon that is presented next to word 'Trinket' at the bottom the card. » A trinket card cannot be flipped during a quest.
» Trinkets provide a hero with passive abilities that are automatically resolved by the app. The trinket card in a hero's play area functions as a reference of their trinket's ability.
· Percentages for trinket abilities are rounded up.
» Heroes gain trinkets through crafting. Crafting recipes for trinkets can be found during quests and awarded for completing feats.
» When a hero crafts a trinket, it is added to the party's inventory for the remainder of the campaign.

Equipping Trinkets
Before starting a quest, a hero selects the trinket they wish to equip in the hero loadout screen. Then, they place the trinket card faceup in their play area so the faceup side matches the trinket they selected in the app.
» Each hero can only have one trinket equipped at a time.

Turn (Hero Turn)
During a hero's turn, they can perform one maneuver action and up to two additional actions of their choice.

» A hero can resolve abilities and spend movement points after they have performed all of their actions. As such, a hero's turn is not completed until they declare that it is.

Umbra Tokens
Umbra Tokens are a special type of token placed on the map by abilities on Chance’s hero card and some of his skill cards.









» The first ability on both sides of Chance’s hero card allows him to have up to one umbra token on the map at a time.



72
· Some of Chance’s skill cards increase the number of tokens he can have on the map. This effect of these skill cards is cumulative.
· Before Chance would place an umbra token with an ability, he may discard one from the map to allow him to place the new token without exceeding the limit allowed by his abilities.
» Umbra tokens may be placed in a space occupied by a figure or other token, but not in spaces occupied by 3D terrain. » Figures may move into or through spaces with an umbra token.
» When an ability allows an umbra token to Shift X, it moves up to the number of spaces specified. · While moving, umbra tokens obey all elevation rules that apply to heroes.
· Tokens cannot be impeded and may move into or through spaces with other figures, but not 3D terrain.

Underlays
Underlays are a type of terrain that is printed on sheets and is placed partially under map tiles. When placing this terrain, it is important that only the spaces shown in the app are exposed.

» Underlays are treated as extensions of the map tiles that are placed on top of them. An underlay space shares a border—and is therefore adjacent to—any abutting space on that map tile.
» Underlays are treated as if they are on the same level as the map tiles that are placed on top of them. » The heroes can select an underlay in the app to view information about it.
» Heroes and enemies can move into spaces of underlays normally as if the underlays were extensions of the map tiles that are placed on top of them.
» Each type of underlay has unique effects for both heroes and enemies.

Embers
Ember underlays affect a figure each time that figure enters one of its spaces.













» If a hero moves into an ember space, they scar one of their cards.
» If an enemy moves into an ember space, the enemy becomes afflicted and doomed.

Poison
Poison underlays affect a figure each time that figure enters one of its spaces.













» If a hero moves into a poison space, they Infect one of their cards.
» If an enemy moves into a poison space, that enemy becomes enfeebled.



73
Spikes
Spike underlays affect a figure each time that figure enters one of its spaces.













» If a hero or enemy moves into a spike space, they become impeded and suffer two damage.

Water
Water underlays affect a figure each time that figure exits one of its spaces.













» When spending movement points to move out of a water space, a hero or enemy must spend one additional movement point.
» If an effect allows a hero to move without spending movement points, that movement is not affected by water spaces.

Upgrades
Equipment is represented by double-sided cards. One side of the card is the standard version of the equipment and one side is the upgraded version.

» Upgraded equipment is indicated by an upgrade icon that is presented next to the card's type.



















74



















» Heroes can upgrade their equipment by visiting the crafthall.
» During setup, each hero places their chosen equipment in their play area with the appropriate side faceup.
· The default side is the standard side. If the equipment has been upgraded, they place it with the upgraded side faceup instead.
» To craft or upgrade equipment, a hero must spend a recipe and the all the materials required by that recipe. · Recipes can be found during quests and can be awarded for completing feats.
· Materials can be found during quests and some can be purchased at the shop using gold.

Virtues
Each hero has two attributes that represent their primary virtues. These are unique, hero-specific attributes that the app uses to track a hero's narrative choices.

» During the story, heroes make choices that may increase their virtues. Virtues have no inherent effects, but the app uses them to determine exclusive outcomes and choices for a hero.
» Increasing both attributes is just as viable and useful to the app as focusing on a single attribute, so players can make their choices based on the story, gameplay, or how they would like their hero to grow.

Weakness & Resistance
When a hero attacks an enemy, the damage of that attack will be modified if that enemy has a Weakness or a Resistance to one or more damage types on the hero's attack card.
» Each enemy has a weakness to one or more damage types, and powerful enemies may have a resistance to one or more damage types.
» On Heroic and Warfare difficulty, each enemy type gains an additional resistance to a specific damage type.

Weaknesses
Each enemy has a weakness to one or more specific damage types. When an enemy suffers damage of a type that it is weak to, the amount of damage the enemy suffers is increased.












75













» Each damage types that an enemy is weak to is displayed as '?' until the weakness is revealed.
· The first time an enemy suffers damage of a type that they are weak to, that weakness is revealed for the duration of the campaign.
» During a hero's attack, for each success a hero spends, the enemy suffers one additional damage for each of the weapon's damage types that the enemy is weak to.
· This is calculated automatically by the app.

Weapon Card
A hero's weapons are represented by weapon cards, which the heroes use to resolve attacks.

» Each weapon card has two sides. One side is the standard version of the weapon, and the other side is the upgraded version of the weapon.
· An upgraded weapon is indicated by an upgrade icon that is presented next to word 'Weapon' at the bottom the card.





















» Each weapon has a damage value that is used during attacks.
· When a hero is attacking an enemy, for each success (   ) a hero inputs into the app, that enemy suffers an amount of damage equal to the damage value on the weapon being used for that attack.
» If a weapon has a range value, an attack made using that weapon is a ranged attack.
· If a hero is using a weapon that has a range value to attack an enemy, that enemy can be up to a number of spaces away from that hero equal that weapon's range value.
· In addition to being within range, the enemy must also be in line of sight for the hero to be able to attack it.
» Each weapon card has an ability. To resolve an ability on a weapon card, the hero reads the ability's text and follows the instructions.



76
Equipping Weapons
Before starting a quest, a hero selects two weapons in the hero loadout screen. A hero equips both of their selected weapon cards by stacking them together and inserting them into a single card sleeve.
» Each weapon card can only be equipped by the hero that is depicted on that card. · Weapons with the 'Rune' trait can be equipped by any hero.
» Each hero's sleeved pair of weapon cards functions as single, double-sided attack card.
· Because each weapon card has a standard side and an upgraded side, it is important that the hero makes sure that the weapons they selected in the hero loadout screen are the weapons that are facing outward when sleeved.

Weapon Parts
Each weapon is made up of three parts. One primary part and two secondary parts.

» A weapon's primary part matches its weapon card and dictates that weapon's stats and abilities.
» A weapon's secondary parts exist only in the app and may provide the weapon with secondary abilities.
· A secondary ability is a passive ability provided by secondary weapon parts. If a hero is using a weapon that has secondary abilities, they are resolved automatically by the app.
· By default, the secondary parts of a weapon have no inherent effect.
» During the game, heroes can gain recipes for secondary weapon parts that they can craft in the crafthall. · Crafting a weapon part requires a recipe and the materials required by that recipe.
» Between quests, a hero can visit the armory to change a weapon's secondary parts, swapping parts with any available in their inventory.
· Each secondary weapon part can be used with a specific array of primary weapon parts. · The app will not allow a hero to mix weapon parts that do not support each other.
· The weapon parts available to the party can be viewed in the party inventory screen.

Weapon Secondary Abilities
A secondary ability is a passive ability provided by secondary weapon parts. If a hero is using a weapon that has secondary abilities, they are automatically resolved by the app.

» A hero can view the secondary abilities on their equipped weapons in the hero information screen.
» Between quests, a hero can visit the armory to change a weapon's secondary parts, swapping parts with any available in their inventory.
· Each secondary weapon part can be used with a specific array of primary weapon parts. » The app will not allow a hero to mix weapon parts that do not support each other.
» The weapon parts available to the party can be viewed in the party inventory screen.

Wounds
If a hero's health ever is reduced to zero, they are wounded. When a hero is wounded, they typically suffer an injury, which can negatively effect them during the game.




















77
When a hero is wounded, they perform the following steps in order:
1. Set Health Dial: The hero sets their health dial to match their maximum health.
» If there is excess damage that was not suffered when the hero was wounded, that damage is ignored.
2. Input Wound: The hero selects their portrait in the app to view their information screen. Then, they select the 'Wound' button.
3. Follow Instructions: The app provides instructions for the hero to follow. » Typically, the app instructs a hero to suffer an injury.
» The most common way that a hero is wounded is by suffering enough damage to reduce their health to zero. However, some game effects can cause a hero to be wounded directly.
