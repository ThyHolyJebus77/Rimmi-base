## Condensed Rules Summary
1. Goal: Work together to destroy the One Ring in Mordor before Sauron corrupts you. This is a cooperative game - you all win or lose as a team!

2. Setup:
   - Place the main board and first location board (Moria) on the table.
   - Each player gets a Hobbit card, marker, and starting hand of cards.
   - Put Sauron's marker on space 12 of the Corruption track (Or 15 for an easier game).
   - One player starts as the Ring-bearer (usually Frodo).

1. Game Progress:
   - The game moves through different locations (Moria, Helm's Deep, etc.), each with its own board and challenges.
   - Players take turns in clockwise order, starting with the Ring-bearer.
   - On each turn, flip Story tiles until you see an Activity symbol.
   - Then you can play up to 2 cards from your hand.
      - Players can play up to 2 cards, with a maximum of one brown and one grey card.
      - Gandalf Cards: These are separate from the player's hand and can be used at any time by spending 5 points of rune tokens.

4. Activities:
   - Cards and tiles let you move markers on Activity tracks.
   - When a marker reaches a space, do what it says (get tokens, draw cards, roll dice, etc.).

5. Events and Threats:
   - Some tiles move the Event marker, triggering effects that impact all players.
   - The Threat die is rolled when certain spaces or events occur, often causing negative effects.

6. Corruption:
   - Your Hobbit marker moves right on the Corruption track when bad things happen.
   - If you reach Sauron, you're out of the game.

7. Special Actions:
   - The Ring-bearer can use the Ring once per location for a powerful effect, but it's risky.
   - Use Gandalf cards for help by spending 5 points worth of rune tokens.

8. Between Locations:
   - After each location, check if everyone has all three types of Life tokens. Missing tokens cause corruption.
   - The Ring-bearer may change at this point.

1. Winning:
   - Reach Mordor (the final location) and destroy the Ring.
   - You win if the Ring-bearer makes it to the end without being corrupted.
   - The game can also end if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, or if the "Ring is Mine!" event occurs in Mordor.
   - If players win, they score points based on their progress and collected runes.

Remember to communicate with your fellow players, plan your moves together, and manage your hand of cards wisely. Good luck on your journey!

## Factions/Civilizations
Hobbits: Each player controls a Hobbit character (Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, or Fatty). While there are no significant gameplay differences, Frodo starts as the Ring-bearer.

## Additional Notes
The game features multiple Conflict boards representing different locations from the Lord of the Rings story, each with unique challenges and events. Players must balance advancing through the story with managing their corruption levels and resources to succeed in their quest.

# Lord of the Rings - Rules
[[Lord of the Rings.pdf]]

#### Setup

Place the **Master board** on the table and Sauron on
space **12** of the **Corruption track**. Place an **Activity
marker** on the _Bag End_ space.

Place the **Moria Conflict board** below the master board.
Place the **Event marker** on the hourglass space to the
left of the title and 1 Activity marker on the first space
of each of the **Activity tracks**.

Shuffle the 6 gold **Gandalf runes** and place them
facedown next to the boards, along with the remaining
runes faceup and the **Heart** , **Sun** , and **Ring Life tokens**
faceup. Shuffle the square **Story tiles** and place them
facedown near the Moria board as the **Story pile**.

Shuffle the **Quest cards** and place them facedown next
to the Master board as the **Quest deck**.

Sort the **Legendary cards** to match their locations on the
Master board, in this order: _Rivendell, Moria, Lothlórien,
Helm’s Deep, Shelob’s Lair,_ and finally _Mordor_. Stack
them faceup above the Master board locations.

Display the 5 **Gandalf cards** faceup, side by side.

Deal out 1 **Hobbit card** facedown to each player,
according to the number of players: **2 player:** Frodo and
Sam; **3 player:** Frodo, Sam, Pippin; **4 player:** Frodo,
Sam, Pippin, Merry; **5 player:** Frodo, Sam, Pippin,
Merry, Fatty. Each player places his Hobbit card faceup
in front of himself, and takes the matching **Hobbit
marker** and places it on space **0** of the Corruption track.
Unused Hobbit cards and markers go back in the box.

Frodo starts as the **Ring-bearer** and takes the **Ring
token**. He begins the game; play proceeds clockwise.

Players should discuss and coordinate all actions. They
may freely talk about the cards they have in hand, but
may not reveal them. They may not exchange cards or
tokens unless a card specifically tells them to.

#### The Master Board

When the Activity marker is on one of the **Safe Havens**
( _Bag End, Rivendell,_ and _Lothlórien_ ), the players must
perform each action listed above the location’s space,
in order from left to right. The Ring-bearer acts as the
active player.

After the actions have been resolved, move the Activity
marker to the next location.

#### Conflicts

The _Moria, Helm’s Deep, Shelob’s Lair,_ and _Mordor_
locations on the Master board have a corresponding
**Conflict board**. When the Activity marker is on one
of these locations, set up its board below the Master
board, replacing any previous Conflict board.

```
Place an Activity marker on the first space of each
Activity track and the Event marker on the first space of
the board’s Event track. All Story tiles are shuffled into
a new facedown stack at the beginning of each Conflict.
```
```
Turn the Legendary cards belonging to the Conflict
board faceup.
```
## Turn Sequence During Conflicts

```
During a Conflict, players take turns beginning with the
Ring-bearer and going clockwise. The player currently
taking his turn is the active player , and takes these
steps in order:
```
#### 1. Reveal Story Tiles

```
Reveal the top Story tile and place it faceup in front
of all players. The icons on the tile are immediately
resolved, then the tile is placed faceup in a discard pile
(players may not look through these tiles).
```
```
Keep revealing Story tiles and carrying out the
instructions until a tile showing one of the Activity
symbols appears (Friendship, Traveling, Hiding, or
Fighting) , or until the Conflict ends.
```
```
When an Activity symbol is revealed, advance the
corresponding Activity marker by one space and perform
the action for that space.
```
```
If that Activity track is not on the board, or if the marker
already occupies the last space of that track, choose
another Activity track and advance the marker on it.
Story tiles that have a symbol not shown on the board
act as wild cards. The active player may advance any of
the Activity markers.
```
#### 2. Play Cards

```
Once a Story tile is revealed that advances a marker on
an Activity track, proceed to this step. You may play
up to 2 Quest or Legendary cards from your hand, a
maximum of one brown and one grey.
```
```
For each Activity symbol shown on one side of the
card (Friendship, Traveling, Hiding, and/or Fighting) ,
advance the appropriate Activity marker onto the next
space and resolve it. If a marker advances multiple
spaces in one move, resolve the effects of all spaces it
passes over. Each card must be resolved before the next
card may be played.
```
```
If a card played shows more than one symbol, the
respective Activity marker moves one space for each
symbol unless the end of the track is reached.
```
```
A resolved card is placed faceup in a discard pile.
```
```
Playing Legendary Story cards or discarding cards to
pay for an effect does not count toward the 2 card limit
during a player’s turn.
Star symbols are wild , and may be played as any
Activity symbol. When a card with more than one
star symbol is played, all stars must be applied to
the same Activity track.
```
```
When a card with 2 star symbols is discarded to pay
for an effect, these may represent any 2 symbols (even
different ones), but each card can only affect one
Activity track played from a player’s hand.
```
```
Cards with a symbol not shown on the Conflict have no
effect in that particular Conflict. Cards with a symbol
for an Activity track with a marker already on the last
space have no effect.
```
```
Refresh Option The active player may choose not to play
any cards during this step. Instead, he can either draw
2 Quest cards, or move his Hobbit marker one space to
the left on the Corruption track.
```
```
When the Quest deck has been exhausted, remove
the used Legendary cards and Gandalf cards from the
discard pile and place them in the box; they are not
used for the rest of the game. Reshuffle the remaining
Quest cards to form a new Quest deck.
```
## The Power of the Ring

```
Once during each Conflict, the Ring-bearer may put on
the Ring , either after the active player reveals a Story
tile or after the active player resolves a tile or card. The
Ring-bearer may put on the Ring even if it isn’t his turn.
```
```
Place the Ring token on the Ring-bearer’s Hobbit
marker. He then rolls the Threat die and bears any
negative consequences; then advances the Activity
marker on any one Activity track by this number of
spaces: 4 minus the number of symbols on the die.
```
```
This number of spaces is not influenced by Hobbit
cards or Legendary Story cards which limit corruption.
```
```
Spaces moved over or landed on in this way are not
carried out. The marker’s advancement may stop
prematurely only if it reaches the end of the track.
```
```
The active player then continues with his turn. The Ring
remains around the Ring-bearer until the end of that
Conflict, but he plays any subsequent turns as normal.
```
## End of a Conflict

```
A Conflict is completed when either the Activity marker
on the main Activity track reaches the last space, or the
last Event space on the Event track has been resolved.
```
```
When the last space on the main Activity track is
reached and all spaces have been resolved, the active
player then finishes his turn.
```
```
At the end of Moria , Helm’s Deep , and Shelob’s Lair ,
the following happens:
```
**1. Descent Into Darkness**

```
Each player must now have one of each of the 3 Life
tokens ( Heart , Sun , and Ring ). For each token missing
from his collection, he must move his Hobbit 1 space
to the right on the Corruption track. Extra Life tokens
have no effect.
```
**2. Determine Who is the Ring-bearer**
The player with the most Ring Life tokens becomes the
Ring-bearer. In a tie, the Ring goes to the tied player
sitting closest to the current Ring-bearer’s left.

```
Then return all Heart, Sun, and Ring tokens to their
piles. The new Ring-bearer draws 2 Quest cards from
the deck and places the Ring next to his Hobbit card.
```

#### Events

As soon as a _Cycle of Time_ Story tile is drawn, the
Event marker progresses to the next Event space on the
current Conflict board, and that Event is resolved.

The symbols have the same effect as when
rolled on a Threat Die. The symbol means that the
active player may move his Hobbit one space toward the
left side of the Corruption track, if possible.

A player may have to reveal the top card of the Quest
deck, then discard one or more cards from his hand that
share a symbol with the revealed card. If a wild (star)
card is revealed, a player can only discard wild (star)
cards from his hand.

_“Each player:”_ all players must follow the instructions
and consequences independently. The active player
starts, with _all_ players following in clockwise order.

If the _“group”_ must act, all of the players must decide
between them who contributes to fulfill the instructions.

#### Corruption and Elimination

The Hobbits can move in either direction on the
Corruption track, but Sauron always moves to the left
or remains in his current space. **If a Hobbit’s marker
enters the same space as Sauron, or moves past him,
that Hobbit is eliminated from the game.**

If at any time a player does not have enough cards or
runes to pay a cost, he must discard everything he has
and is immediately eliminated from the game.

If eliminated, the player ends his turn immediately and
all of his cards and Life tokens are discarded (he keeps
his runes for the final scoring only). The game continues
and he may act as an advisor.

If a player is eliminated after revealing a Story tile,
the tile must still be resolved. If eliminated during an
_“Each player:”_ Event, the Event must still be resolved
by the remaining players.

#### The Journey Continues

```
After players successfully resolve the Moria board,
advance the Activity marker on the Master board to
Lothlórien and distribute the Lothlórien Legendary cards
to the players.
```
```
After Lothlórien , continue to Helm’s Deep, Shelob’s
Lair, and finally Mordor.
```
#### Ending the Game

```
The game concludes when:
The Ring-bearer is eliminated from the game.
```
```
The “Ring is Mine!” Event is resolved in Mordor
(this cannot be avoided once encountered).
The Fellowship destroys the Ring.
```
#### Destroying the RIng

```
To destroy the Ring , the Ring-bearer must reach the end
of the main Activity track on the Mordor Conflict board.
```
```
If the consequences of the last space’s Threat die roll
do not eliminate the Ring-bearer, the Conflict ends and
the Ring token is placed on the Ring depicted on the
board.
```
```
Now none of the players are considered the Ring-bearer,
and the Fellowship can attempt to destroy the Ring.
```
```
The active player then continues his turn, rolling the
Threat die (a separate Threat die roll from reaching the
end of the track) to determine if he destroys the Ring.
```
```
If the active player is not eliminated as a consequence
of the roll, the Ring is successfully destroyed and the
active player receives 1 of the facedown gold runes.
If the active player is eliminated as a consequence of
the roll, then the Threat die is passed clockwise to the
next player, who now becomes the active player and
rolls the Threat die and so on, until either the Ring is
destroyed or all players are eliminated.
```
#### Scoring

```
If the Ring is destroyed, all players (including
eliminated players) score 60 points plus the combined
numbers on the unspent Gandalf Rune tokens collected
as a Fellowship.
```
```
If the Fellowship reaches Mount Doom , but all players
are eliminated before destroying the Ring, they score 60
points, but rune totals are not added in.
```
```
If the Ring-bearer is eliminated before reaching the
final space in Mordor , the game ends immediately, and
the players score equal to the point value of the current
space of the Activity marker on the main Activity track.
Unspent runes do not count.
```
#### Game Variants

```
Introductory Game Sauron starts on space 15 of the
Corruption track.
Expert Game Sauron starts on space 10.
Pass the Ring If the current Ring-bearer is eliminated
from the game for any reason other than meeting
Sauron on the Corruption track, the player to his left
becomes the new Ring-bearer, and the game continues.
```
```
Equal Turns Ignore the rule that the Ring-bearer starts
each Conflict and continue playing clockwise instead.
Use a token to indicate the active player.
```
```
Competitive Game
Keep all runes facedown and do not show their values
to the other players. If the Ring is destroyed, each
player scores 60 points plus a bonus equal to the sum
of all the runes he collected (whether or not he is still in
the game). The highest scoring player is the winner.
```
```
Additionally, if the Ringbearer possesses 3 or more Ring
tokens when his Hobbit meets Sauron on the Corruption
track, he wins and he alone scores the point value of
the current space of the marker on the main Activity
track, while all the other players score zero.
```

#### Activity Tracks

```
Silver Gandalf Rune Take a rune with a
value of 1 and places it faceup in front
of you. Runes with higher values may be
used to replace the corresponding number
of lower value runes.
```
```
Gold Gandalf Rune Randomly take 1 of
the special runes placed facedown at the
start of the game, and place it faceup in
front of you.
```
```
Life Token Take 1 of the corresponding
Life tokens. This token stays in front of
your Hobbit card until the end of the
Conflict.
```
```
Legendary Card Take the depicted
Legendary card. Add it to your hand;
it may be used on the same turn, if
applicable.
```
```
Purity Move your Hobbit 1 space to the
left on the Corruption track, if possible.
```
```
Threat Die Roll the Threat die. If a space
includes an instruction to roll the Threat
die, do not roll the die until you have
finished carrying out all other space
instructions. The Threat die must be rolled
before you can play another card.
```
#### The Threat Die

Whenever the symbol is encountered, the Threat die
must be rolled with the following results:

```
Sauron moves 1 space toward the Hobbits
on the Corruption Track.
The active player moves his Hobbit a
number of spaces equal to the number
of symbols shown toward Sauron on the
Corruption track.
```
```
The active player must discard 2 cards
from his hand.
```
#### Story Tiles

```
After each of these are resolved the active player must
then reveal another Story tile.
```
```
The Ring’s Influence The Ring-bearer
must move his Hobbit marker 1 space
toward Sauron on the Corruption track.
```
```
Sauron’s Will One player must volunteer
to advance his Hobbit 2 spaces toward
Sauron on the Corruption track, otherwise
Sauron moves 1 space toward the Hobbits.
```
```
Cycle of Time Move the Event marker
to the next Event space on the current
Conflict board and resolve the stated
Event.
Out of Options If the Fellowship discards
3 cards between them, there is no effect.
If not, the next Event occurs, as stated
under Cycle of Time.
```
```
Losing Ground If the Fellowship discards
1 card, any 1 Life token, and a single rune
between them, there is no effect. If not,
the next Event occurs, as stated under
Cycle of Time.
```
#### Gandalf Cards

```
At any time during the game, unless otherwise stated,
any one player may call Gandalf for help by discarding
runes with a total value of 5. The active player then
decides which of the Gandalf cards to use and how to
apply it.
```
```
Gandalf cards may be used after revealing a Story tile,
but before resolving it. They are used once, applied
immediately and then discarded.
```
```
Healing Choose a player (even yourself) to move
his Hobbit marker up to 2 spaces to the left on the
Corruption track.
```
```
Persistence Choose a player (even yourself) to draw
4 Quest cards from the deck.
```
```
Guidance You may use this card as if you had just
played or discarded a card with 2 wild (star) symbols.
Foresight Look at the top 3 Story tiles and arrange them
in any order before putting them back on top of the pile.
Magic After moving the Event marker onto the next
Event space, ignore the Event. If this is the final Event
in a Conflict, the Conflict still ends. This cannot prevent
the last Event space in Mordor from causing the game
to be lost.
```
#### Legendary Story Cards

```
Green Legendary cards may be played from a player’s
hand at any time, unless otherwise stated. Story cards
do not count toward the limit of 2 playable cards during
a turn. The player decides how the card is applied.
```
```
Miruvor Allow any player to pass 1 card to
another player.
```
```
Belt of Galadriel Play this card on any
player instructed to make 1 Threat die roll,
before the roll; he does not have to roll.
May be used at Mount Doom but not when
a Hobbit puts on the Ring.
```
```
Mithril Shirt Ignore the results of 1 Threat
die roll (play this card on any player after
he has rolled). May be used at Mount
Doom. When a Hobbit puts on the Ring,
this card does not influence the number of
spaces that the Activity marker advances.
```
```
Athelas If any player is missing 1 or more
Life tokens, the player does not bear the
negative consequences (play this card on
any player at the end of a Conflict or in one
of the corresponding Events in Mordor ).
```
```
Gandalf’s Staff Ignore all of the effects of a
Out of Options or Losing Ground Story tile.
The Fellowship does not need to discard
any of the depicted items, and the Event
marker is not moved to the next space.
Cannot be applied to a Cycle of Time tile.
```
```
Phial of Galadriel Play this card on the
active player when he is about to reveal the
next Story tile. He does not reveal any
more Story tiles, but continues his turn as
usual with the Play Cards step. This may
be played to prevent a player from
revealing any Story tiles during his turn.
Elessar Any player may move his Hobbit
marker 1 space toward the left of the
Corruption track, if possible.
```
```
Lembas Any player may discard as many
cards as he wishes and then draw cards
from the Quest deck until he has a hand of
6 cards.
```
```
Gollum This card is a triple wild (star) card
that may be used when discarding
symbols, or to advance 3 spaces on one
Activity Track. In both cases, the player
who played it has to roll the Threat die
immediately thereafter. If this card is
discarded for any effect other than its 3
star symbols, the Threat die is not rolled.
```
