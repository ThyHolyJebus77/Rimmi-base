# Black Orchestra - Rules
## Setup

Place **Hitler** and the 5 **deputy tiles** on their starting spaces.

Randomly shuffle the **item tiles** and place one facedown
on every black square space on the board.

Select a **difficulty level** and place the red **military
support marker** on the appropriate value (2 for _Easy_ , 3
for _Standard_ , 4 for _Hard_ ). Then place the corresponding
**difficulty tile** over the part of the track listed on the back
of the tile.

Shuffle the **event cards** into their respective stages
and place each stack along the top of the game board,
ordered 1 to 7. Remove 2 cards from each deck from the
game without looking at them.

Place the **conspirator deck** , **interrogation deck** , and **dice**
beside the board.

Each player chooses, or is randomly dealt, 1 **conspirator
board** (2 if playing solo), plus a **pawn** and 2 **marker cubes**
in a matching color. Place one of your cubes on each
of the marked starting levels for **motivation** _(timid)_ and
**suspicion** _(medium)_.

Players place their pawns on the **TRAIN STATION**
space in **BERLIN**.

## 1. Hitler and Deputy Penalties

**If you** **_begin_** **your turn in the same space** as Hitler and/or
any of his 5 deputies, suffer the listed penalty:

**HITLER** Decrease your **motivation** by 1.

**HESS** Choose and discard a card from your dossier.

**GOEBBELS** You cannot use your special ability this turn.

**BORMANN** You cannot take a **Conspire** action this turn.

**HIMMLER** Raise your **suspicion** by 1.

**GOERING** Choose and discard one of your items.

## 2. Take up to 3 Actions

You may take any combination of 3 actions. All actions
except **Conspire** can be taken multiple times.

#### ACTION

You may resolve 1 effect on your conspirator sheet or on
a card in your dossier preceded by the symbol.

A effect does not require an action to resolve and can
be resolved at any time, even on another player’s turn.

#### COLLECT ITEM

Take a revealed **item tile** in your space and add it to your
conspirator sheet, observing item limits.

#### CONSPIRE

**You can only take this action once during your turn.**

Take up to 3 dice, spending 1 action for each die taken.

```
Roll all of those dice and resolve the results in this order:
1 For each , you and all other conspirators in your
space raise suspicion by 1.
2 For each , place that die on the dissent track.
3 Total all the number results: you may perform up to
that number of actions this turn.
```
```
DISSENT TRACK
Once 3 dice are on the dissent track, the active player
immediately chooses and applies either of these effects:
```
- Choose 1 conspirator to increase their motivation by 1.
- Decrease Hitler’s military support by 1 (cannot go
    below its starting level).

```
Return all dice on the track to the supply. Now add any
additional ‘overflow’ results rolled to the now-cleared
track.
```
#### DELIVER ITEM

```
Some board spaces are marked with items that can be
delivered there. Once a facedown item has been removed
from a board space, you can deliver to that space.
```
```
Discard the appropriate item(s) from your conspirator
sheet and gain the listed benefit. If the benefit as listed
as distributed , players may distribute the benefits among
themselves however they choose, regardless of location.
```
#### DOSSIER

```
Draw 1 card from the conspirator deck and add it to your
dossier faceup, observing card limits.
```
```
Cards marked with this symbol are Illegal.
```
#### MOVE

```
You can move from one space to a space connected to it
by a white dotted line.
```
```
You may only enter areas of the map with a stage
number equal to or less than the current stage’s number.
However, once stage 7 begins, some previously available
spaces become off-limits for the rest of the game.
```
```
When you enter a space with modifiers, immediately
apply the listed modifiers and continue your turn.
Applying the effects does not count as an action.
```
```
You can gain the effects of a space multiple times in a
turn, but you must move off the space and then move
back on it to gain the effect again.
```
```
Fortified locations serve as required elements for
some plots. Otherwise, they have no game effect.
```
#### RELEASE

```
If you are at Extreme suspicion, you cannot perform
this action.
```
```
Attempt to use your influence and order another
conspirator to be released from prison. You must be in
the GESTAPO HQ space and not at Extreme suspicion.
```
```
Roll 1 die. On a result of , you are arrested.
```
```
On any other result, raise your suspicion by 1 and choose
one arrested conspirator to release.
```
```
The released conspirator moves to GESTAPO HQ
at High suspicion.
```
#### REVEAL ITEM

```
Flip an unrevealed item tile in your space faceup.
```
#### TRANSFER

```
Give or take 1 card or item from another conspirator in
the same space, observing card and item limits.
```
## 3. Draw an Event card

```
Draw the top card from the lowest numbered (left-most)
event deck available and place it faceup in the current
event space , resolving its effects immediately.
```
```
If you can’t draw an event card when required, the
players lose the game.
```
```
When there are no more cards in a stage, move on to the
next numbered stage.
```
```
The card showing on top of the current event space (the
last event that was resolved) is the current event.
```
```
The current event tells you the number of the current
event stage. A new stage begins after the first card of that
new stage has been drawn, not when the previous stage’s
deck runs out.
Once stage 7 begins, many previously available spaces
are now off-limits for the rest of the game: move Hitler,
deputies, and conspirators to the nearest legal space.
```
```
KEY EVENTS
Each stage’s deck has 1 key event (some may have been
randomly removed during setup).
When a key event is drawn, place it faceup in the current
event space as normal.
When the next event card is drawn, shift the key event
card to the right and place it faceup on the key event
space to the right of the board (it isn’t considered active).
```
```
If a key event is in play and an important event (yellow
top) is drawn, remove it from the game without effect and
draw a new event card to replace it.
```
```
If there is no key event in play and an important event is
drawn, resolve the event as usual.
```
```
Key events are discarded when the next stage begins.
```
```
After resolving an event card, your turn is over.
```
```
If an effect would have you draw multiple event cards
in a turn, completely resolve the first event card before
drawing the next.
```
```
The player to your left is now the active player and begins
their turn.
```
## Berlin

```
All B Berlin spaces (including the TRAIN STATION )
are considered to be stage 1 spaces and adjacent to one
another.
```
```
They all count as Berlin for the purposes of card effects;
however each space is not considered the same space for
transfers, plot stipulations, etc. Conspirators still need to
be in the same space to fulfill those conditions.
You can only enter or leave a Berlin space from a non-
Berlin space by going through the TRAIN STATION.
```

## Hitler and Deputy Movement

When Hitler or a deputy move, **they must end the move
in a different location than they started from** , regardless
of any conspirator(s) in the space they started from.

## Motivation

Your conspirator sheet lists the benefit gained while at
each level of motivation, and you also retain the benefits
of any lower level.

## Dossiers and Items

The area below your board where you place conspirator
cards is your **dossier**. Conspirator cards are never held in
hand or played outside of the dossier.

If you ever exceed your item or dossier limit, immediately
discard down to that limit. You may still get cards
and items, but you must discard down to your limit
immediately afterwards.

**Players can carry** up to 3 items (3, 4 or 5 player game)
or 4 items (1 or 2 player game).

**The maximum number of cards you can have in your
dossier** is 6 (1-2 players), 5 (3-4 players) or 4 (5 players).
However if you are at _timid_ motivation, your dossier limit
is 2 cards.

## Gestapo Raids

When a _Gestapo Raid_ Event card is drawn, each
conspirator performs the following steps in order:

**1 If you are at** **_Extreme_** **suspicion, you are arrested**.
Arrested conspirators discard all _Illegal_ cards in their
dossier. **If all players are in prison at the same time,
the players lose the game.**

**2 For each** **_Illegal_** **card in your dossier, you must choose
to either discard it, or keep it and raise your suspicion
by 1**. Resolve one card at a time in any order you
choose. If you reach _Extreme_ suspicion during this
step, keep any remaining Illegal cards.

**3 The active player removes all dice on the dissent track**.

## Arrest and Prison

When you are arrested, immediately move to the **PRISON**
space and discard all _Illegal_ cards in your dossier.

The prison is not adjacent to any other location and is not
a valid location for any sort of movement or card effect
unless the effect specifically states that you are released.
The only way to get into or out of prison is to be arrested
or released.

**PRISON RESTRICTIONS**
You cannot resolve effects from cards in your dossier or
character sheet, including effects.

You can’t be the target of, and are unaffected by, all card
effects, including event and interrogation cards.

Your special ability is considered blank, even if you are at
a high enough motivation to use it.

You retain all of your items and non- _Illegal_ conspirator
cards in your dossier when arrested, but you cannot
discard, resolve, or transfer them.

###### ARRESTED PLAYER’S TURN

```
If you start your turn in prison, follow this turn sequence
instead of following the usual turn structure:
1 Draw an interrogation card.
```
```
2 Draw an event card.
```
```
INTERROGATION CARDS
When you draw an interrogation card, secretly read it and
choose one of the options. You cannot reveal or discuss
the options with other players at any time.
```
```
Unlike resolving other effects, if you can’t fully apply all the
effect(s) of an option, you must choose a different option.
```
```
You may always choose the Try and Resist option.
When applying the result of the roll, resolve as much of
the effect as you can and disregard the rest of the text.
Once you’ve chosen which option to resolve, read it aloud
and apply its effects, but do not reveal the other options.
You choose the target for all effects. Conspirators in jail
(including you) cannot be the target of any card effect ,
including interrogation cards.
```
```
You are only released from prison when a card effect
specifically says so.
```
```
After resolving the interrogation card, shuffle it back into
the deck unless the card instructs otherwise.
```
## Plots

```
To win the game, you need to successfully attempt one of
the plot cards from the conspirator deck :
```
```
PREPARATIONS
First confirm that you meet all the required elements
listed on the left side of the plot card.
```
```
You must be at committed or reckless motivation to
attempt a plot, and some plots can only be attempted
with reckless motivation.
```
```
If all the required elements are met, you can use the
Act action and resolve the Attempt one plot in
your dossier effect listed on the committed line of your
conspirator sheet.
```
**1. BUILD THE DICE POOL
Your dice pool always starts with 1 die** gained by meeting
the required elements to attempt a plot.

```
The right side of the plot card lists optional elements
that help by either by adding dice to the dice pool ( )
or by removing results. There are 3 types:
```
```
ITEMS You may discard any of the items listed for
their associated benefit. Unless otherwise specified,
each benefit can only be gained once. You can also
discard items carried by other conspirators in your
space (with their permission).
```
```
AFFILIATION If your affiliation ( Abwehr, Civilian, or
Wehrmacht ) matches the affiliation on the plot, you
gain the associated benefit. Unlike items, you cannot
use the affiliations of other conspirators in your space.
```
```
MEETING Optional elements based on other
conspirators in your space that allow you to add one or
more to the dice pool.
```
```
Some conspirator cards and abilities can also add
benefits to the dice pool.
```
**2. DETERMINE DIFFICULTY**
Determine the final difficulty of the plot attempt by
noting the current level of **Hitler’s military support** as well
as the active player’s **suspicion**. Check the current **event**
and all **cards in dossier** s to find any other modifiers.
Announce the number of needed to succeed as well
as the number of that would result in failure.
You may now choose to _remove_ any amount of dice from
the dice pool.
Finally, roll all dice in the final dice pool simultaneously.
**3. SUCCESS OR FAILURE?
Check For Suspicious Activity:** If the number of
_equals or exceeds_ the amount of dice shown below your
current suspicion, the plot attempt immediately fails.

```
All other dice results are ignored, even if it would result
in a successful plot attempt. Discard the attempted
plot card and move Hitler to the CHANCELLERY.
All conspirators lower their motivation by 1, and the
conspirator who attempted the plot is arrested.
```
```
Was The Attempt Successful? If the number of
is lower than the dice shown on your conspirator sheet
under your current suspicion, your plot was not detected.
```
```
Count the number of and compare it to Hitler’s
military support. If the number rolled was lower than
Hitler’s military support, the plot has failed. However, the
plot was not detected and you were able to escape. Do
not discard the attempted plot card and continue your
turn as normal.
```
## Victory!

```
You win the game if you assassinate Hitler by attempting
a plot and rolling a total number of on the dice equal
to or exceeding the current level of Hitler’s military
support – while rolling under the allowed by the
suspicion of the conspirator attempting the plot.
```
## Defeat...

The players lose the game if:
```
- AIl players are in prison.
- The _Documents Located_ event card is drawn.
- You can’t draw an event card when you are required to.

###### TRUSTED LIEUTENANTS

```
Deputies can be killed with plot cards in the same way
Hitler can. The difficulty for deputies is always 2.
To win, you must not only eliminate Hitler, you must
eliminate at least 2 of his deputies as well.
```
```
SENSE OF URGENCY
During setup, discard an additional card from each event
deck.

on the plot card help by either by adding dice to the dice
pool ( ) or by removing results. Conspirator cards
and abilities can also add benefits to the dice pool.

```
ITEMS You may discard any of the items listed for
their associated benefit. You can also discard items
carried by other conspirators in your space (with their
permission).
```
```
AFFILIATION If your affiliation matches the affiliation
on the plot, you gain the associated benefit. You cannot
use the affiliations of other conspirators in your space.
MEETING Optional elements based on other
conspirators in your space that allow you to add one
or more to the dice pool.
```
**2. DETERMINE DIFFICULTY**
Determine the final difficulty of the plot attempt by
noting the current level of **Hitler’s military support** and
your **suspicion**.

```
Check the current event and all cards in dossier s to find
any other modifiers.
Announce the number of needed to succeed as well as
the number of that would result in failure.
```
```
You may now choose to remove any amount of dice from
the dice pool. Finally, roll all dice in the final dice pool
simultaneously.
```
**3. SUCCESS OR FAILURE?
Check For Suspicious Activity:** If the number of
_equals or exceeds_ the amount of dice shown below your
current suspicion, the plot attempt immediately fails.

```
All other dice results are ignored, even if it would result
in a successful plot attempt. Discard the attempted
plot card and move Hitler to the CHANCELLERY.
All conspirators lower their motivation by 1, and the
conspirator who attempted the plot is arrested.
```
```
Was The Attempt Successful? If the number of
is lower than the dice shown on your conspirator sheet
under your current suspicion, your plot was not detected.
```
```
Count the number of and compare it to Hitler’s
military support. If the number rolled was lower than
Hitler’s military support, the plot has failed. However, the
plot was not detected and you were able to escape. Do
not discard the attempted plot card and continue your
turn as normal.
```
```
You win the game if the number of equals or exceeds
Hitler’s military support.
