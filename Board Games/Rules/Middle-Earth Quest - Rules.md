## Condensed Rules Summary

1. Setup: Choose one player to be Sauron, the others are heroes. Place game pieces on the board as shown in the setup diagram.

2. Game Flow: The game alternates between Sauron's turn and each hero's turn.

3. Sauron's Turn:
   - Place influence tokens on the board
   - Play plot cards to hinder heroes
   - Move monsters and minions
   - Draw cards

4. Hero's Turn:
   - Move to a new location
   - Fight monsters or face challenges
   - Complete quests
   - Gain favor (resource) and items

5. Combat: When heroes fight monsters or minions, both sides play cards from their hand. Compare attack and defense values to determine damage.

6. Story Track: As the game progresses, markers move along the Story Track. The first side to reach the end gains an advantage.

7. Winning: The game ends when a side reaches the end of the Story Track or fulfills their secret mission. In the final battle, if the heroes defeat the Ringwraiths, they win. If not, Sauron wins.

Remember, Sauron tries to spread evil influence, while the heroes work together to stop him and complete quests. Good luck!

---

## Factions/Civilizations
- Sauron: Controls monsters and minions, spreads influence, and plays plot cards to hinder heroes.
- Heroes: Each hero has unique abilities, starting locations, and personal quests. They work together to oppose Sauron but have individual goals.

## Additional Information
The game features a Story Track that represents the progress of good and evil forces. The side that reaches the end first gains an advantage in the final confrontation. The game's narrative can change based on event cards and completed quests, providing high replayability.

# Middle-Earth Quest - Rules

## Setup

One player is **Sauron** and the rest are the **Heroes**. Each hero
player selects a **Hero sheet** and places their figure on its
starting location. Take the 5 **Hero decks** and one **Skill deck**
(star icon). Place the Skill deck facedown next to the board.
Each hero shuffles their corresponding Hero deck and places
it facedown next to the **Life Pool** edge of his hero sheet. Each
hero randomly places one of his **Starting Quest** cards before
him and follows any _Setup_ instructions. Unused cards go back
in the box. Each hero takes his **Advanced Quest** card.

Place all **Favor** and **Character** tokens and all **Influence** tokens
on their respective board areas. Shuffle the **Event** decks by
numbered stage, and place them facedown next to the board.
Shuffle the **Encounter** decks by region, and place them
facedown on their areas on the board.

Place the 4 **story markers** (green for the heroes; yellow, black,
and red for Sauron) on the _start_ space of the **Story Track**.
The _current stage_ is always the rightmost stage of the track
containing at least one story marker.

Place the _Black Serpent_ and _Mouth of Sauron_ figures on their
starting locations, and the other 3 minions off the board.

Randomly select one of 3 **Starting Plot** cards; place it on the **1**
space of the **Active Plot Track** and the matching plot marker on
the affected location, then follow the card’s instructions.

Shuffle the **Shadow** , **Corruption** , **Peril** , and **Advanced Plot**
decks and place them facedown on the board. Place the
**Monster Reference cards** faceup in a pile, and shuffle each of
the 3 **Monster Combat** decks and place them facedown next to
the board. Randomize each of the 5 types of colored **monster
tokens** , and place them in piles with the artwork side down.
Place the **2** and **3** plot markers next to the **Plot deck** and all
other tokens to the side of the board.

Shuffle the **Sauron** and **Hero Mission** decks. Each side draws
a card from the top of his respective deck, reads it and places
it facedown near them. Players can look at their _own_ Mission
card at any time. Unused Mission cards go back in the box.

The Sauron player takes a **Sauron turn** , then moving clockwise,
each hero player takes a **hero turn**.

## Sauron turn

## 1. Hero Rally

**Each hero discards all Influence tokens** from his current location
to the Influence area (except if he is in a _Shadow Stronghold)._

## 2. Story

_Skip this step on the first turn of the game._ **Advance the hero
story marker 2 spaces up the Story Track.** Sauron’s 3 story
markers are each advanced according to his active Plot cards.

If this is the first time a story marker has entered Stage II or
III of the Story Track, Sauron may place new **minions**.

If a marker reaches the **Finale** space, or if all 3 of Sauron’s
markers reach **The Shadow Falls** space, the game **Finale** begins.

## 3. Plot

_Skip this step on the first turn of the game._ **Sauron may either:**

```
a. Play a single Plot card from his hand: Fulfill its require-
ments, place it on an empty space of the Active Plot
Track, and place its plot marker in the affected location.
The number in the top left of a Plot or Shadow card is
the minimum amount of influence that must be in the
Shadow Pool in order to play the card.
```
```
b. Discard an active Plot card, or do nothing.
```
## 4. Event

**1. Draw and Resolve Event**
Sauron draws 3 cards from the current stage’s Event deck and
resolves one of them. Discard the other cards faceup.

```
Heroes are dominant : resolve the card with the lowest priority.
Sauron is dominant : resolve the card with the highest priority.
If neither side is dominant (and during the first Sauron turn of
the game) , instead draw one card and resolve it.
```
**2. Place Characters and Favor**
For each **favor** listed on the Event card, take a favor token from
the **Favor and Character** area and place it in the location.

```
For each character listed, take the character token from
the Favor and Character area and place it in the location.
A designated character token already on another location
remains there.
```
**3. Keep in Play or Discard**
If the card has the **event marker icon** (green flag) in its upper
right, place it on the **Current Event Card** space, discarding any
card there. Place the event marker in the designated location
(the marker is discarded when the card is discarded).

```
If the card has no event marker icon, it is discarded.
```
## 5. Action

```
Sauron may take 2 actions (or 3 actions in a 4 player game).
```
```
Each time you take an action, choose one of the 3 action types
designated by the Action Track area by placing one of your action
tokens on the leftmost empty space of the appropriate Action
Track, then resolving the action based upon the action type.
As long as 3 or fewer action tokens are on the game board,
they remain on the spaces they were placed. When you place
your fourth action token on the Action Track area, immediately
remove your 3 prior tokens.
```
```
Action: Place Influence
Receive a number of influence tokens equal to the number on
the Action Track space you just covered.
You may immediately place up to 2 tokens of this influence in
the Shadow Pool and the rest on a Shadow Stronghold or in
extension of your Strongholds (a contiguous path must be traced
through locations containing influence back to a Stronghold).
```
```
Tokens may never be placed in Haven locations.
```
```
Each location in extension of a Shadow Stronghold cannot
contain more influence than the highest connected
Stronghold’s influence strength (the number of influence
tokens on the Stronghold; the red number is the maximum).
Excess influence must immediately be removed, to a minimum
of 1. Remove all but 1 token from locations if they are
disconnected from their connection to a Stronghold.
```
```
The amount of influence Sauron may have in the Pool is equal
to 4 times the current game stage.
```
```
Action: Draw Shadow and Plot Cards
Draw a number of Shadow and Plot cards each equal to the
number on the Action Track space you just covered.
```
```
Place the Shadow cards into your hand, but keep only one
of the drawn Plot cards, placing the others facedown at the
bottom of the Plot deck (in the order you choose).
```
```
Action: Command Monsters and Minions
Receive a number of commands equal to the number on the
Action Track space you just covered. Each monster token
and minion may only receive one command per Command
Monsters and Minions action.
```
```
For each command, you may perform one of the following:
```
```
Move Monster or Minion: Choose a monster token or minion on
a board location and move it to an adjacent location, ignoring
movement icons. Monster tokens may only be moved onto
locations that contain at least one influence token; minions
may move onto any location.
Minions are allowed to move into Haven locations, but you cannot
attack a hero in a Haven location unless the hero allows it.
Place Monster Token: Choose one of the 5 monster token
piles, draw a random token, secretly look at it and then place
it facedown on any location matching the token’s color that
contains at least one influence.
Only one monster token may be placed with each Command
Monsters and Minions action (regardless of the number of
commands it provides).
Monster tokens may not be placed on locations that contain
heroes (they may be moved there). More than one monster
token (or minion) can occupy the same location.
```
```
Heal Minion: Choose a minion on any location and remove
up to 4 damage tokens from its Minion space on the board. A
minion on the same location as a hero may not be healed.
```
## 6. Hero Draw

```
Each hero player draws cards from his life pool up to his hero’s
fortitude. There is no card hand limit.
```
## Hero turn

## 1. Rest

```
If there are no monster tokens or minions in your location and
you are not in a Shadow Stronghold, you may rest. Shuffle all
cards from your rest pool into your life pool and then advance
the leftmost Sauron story marker one space on the Story Track
(you may choose which marker if there is a tie).
```
```
You may also discard one of your Corruption cards by
discarding the number of favor tokens shown in the lower right
corner of the card. If in a Haven, you may also heal (even if a
minion is present). Shuffle all cards from your damage pool into
your life pool.
```
## 2. Ambush

```
Sauron must choose and attack with one monster or minion
in the hero’s location. If the hero is in a Haven, combat only
takes place if the hero allows it. If your hero is defeated, your
turn immediately ends.
```
## 3. Travel

```
Your hero may travel to a connected location on the board,
fight enemies, resolve perilous locations, and explore. Your
hero may repeat the sequence below as many times as your
hand of Hero cards allows.
```
```
a. Move
You may move to an adjacent location by discarding the
required Hero card(s) from your hand.
```
```
Discard one card from your hand with an icon matching the
movement icon on the connecting path. If you cannot, or
choose not to, you may instead discard a number of cards
equal to the number on the movement icon. Discarded Hero
cards are placed faceup in a discard pile on the Rest Pool
edge of your hero sheet.
```
```
If you have a Boat Item card, you can travel across water
(blue) paths by discarding any one Hero card from your hand,
regardless of the movement icon.
```
```
An “ any card ” icon means you must simply discard any one
Hero card from your hand to cross the path.
```
```
b. Combat or Peril
If you have moved to a new location that is perilous and/or
contains one or more monster tokens or minions, Sauron must
resolve one of the following (if able):
```
```
Monster or Minion Attack: If there is a monster token or
minion in your new location, Sauron may flip over a monster
token of his choice, or choose a minion, in the location.
Your hero must now engage in combat with the selected
monster or minion. If you do not defeat this monster or minion
in combat, your hero turn immediately ends.
```
```
If the chosen monster token is blank ( ie. , there is no
illustration of a monster), it is discarded, and you proceed to
the Explore part of this Travel step.
```
```
Peril: If your location is perilous , Sauron may draw 3 cards
from the Peril deck and choose one for your location/region
to resolve. Then all drawn cards are discarded faceup to a
discard pile.
Sauron may not choose a Peril card that does not affect your
current location or region. If none of the cards affect your
location or region, the cards are discarded without effect.
```
```
c. Explore
You may explore your current location by doing any or all of the
following in any order:
Retrieve Favor: Retrieve any number of favor tokens on the
current location and place them on your hero sheet.
Consult with Characters: Receive favor from or use the ability
of each Character on the current location, but not both. The
character is then returned to the Favor and Character area of
the board.
```
```
Choose a Dark Path: If you have 3 or less Corruption cards,
you may choose to gain 1 favor and gain 1 Corruption card.
You may only choose a dark path once during each of your turns.
```
```
Complete a Quest: Complete any Quests for which you have
fulfilled the requirement (there is no limit to the number of
Quests that can be completed here).
Discard a Plot: Discard any of Sauron’s active Plot cards that
affect the current location (if any) by following the Plot card’s
discard requirements (usually by spending favor).
```
```
Trade with Heroes: All heroes in the current location may freely
trade favor, Item cards, and Quests with each other (excluding
Starting and Advanced Quests).
```
```
A hero who wishes to explore the location he started his turn
on may skip the Move and the Combat or Peril parts of his first
Travel step and then explore in his current location (then he
may choose to take additional Travel steps, as normal).
```
## 4. Encounter

```
After you have finished your Travel step, if you are not in a
perilous location, you must draw 3 Encounter cards from the
Encounter deck matching the location’s color.
```
```
If you are on a Haven , you must instead draw 3 cards from the
Haven Encounter deck (3 white towers).
```
```
You then resolve the card with the lowest priority number that
also affects your location. The other 2 cards are discarded
faceup to a discard pile.
If none of the Encounter cards affect your current location or
region, they are all discarded, and your hero turn is over.
```
```
If the term Quest appears in italics at the top of the Encounter
card’s text box, place the card faceup in your play area.
```
```
If an Encounter deck runs out of cards, its discard pile is
shuffled to create a new deck.
```

## otHer ruleS

**Dominance**
The **heroes** count the number of spaces from their story marker
to the **Finale** space. **Sauron** uses the _lower_ of the following
numbers: the number of spaces from his closest story marker
to the **Finale** space, or the _cumulative_ number of spaces
needed for all his story markers to advance to **The Shadow
Falls** space of the Story Track.

The side with the _lower_ number is **dominant**. On a tie, there is
no dominant side.

**Level Tokens**
Level tokens mark a hero’s increased experience in one of his
four attributes (fortitude, strength, agility, and wisdom). They
are placed over the appropriate attribute on the hero sheet.

**Each hero may increase each of his attributes a maximum of
twice per game.**

**Skill Cards and Training**
A hero who receives **training** draws the top 2 cards of the **Skill
deck** , chooses one to place into his hand, and discards the
other faceup in a discard pile.

A Skill card added to a hero’s hand is part of his deck for the
rest of the game and treated as a Hero card in all respects.

**Quests**
Unless otherwise specified, **Quests** are completed during
the _Explore_ part of the hero’s Travel step. A Quest is always
assigned to a specific hero and may only be completed by
the hero displaying it in his play area. Completed Quests are
removed from the game and are no longer used.

**Perilous Locations**
These are defined as all permanently Perilous Locations (sword
symbol) and any location with more Influence than the current
hero’s Wisdom.

**Cards and Components**
When any card deck or the monster token pile is depleted,
reshuffle the discards into a new deck/pile. If favor, influence,
or damage tokens run out, use suitable replacements. All other
components are limited to those provided.

## CoMBat

Each combat always involves 2 **combatants** : a single **hero**
against a single **monster** or **minion**.

Combat never occurs in **Haven** locations, unless the hero
allows the combat to take place.

If multiple cards are resolved at the same time, the hero
player’s combat card is always resolved first.

## Combat Steps

Follow this sequence in order until the combat ends:

**1. Sauron Setup**
Sauron takes the appropriate **Monster Reference card** (if a
monster is in the combat) and matching **Monster Combat
deck** ( **Zealot** , **Ravager** , or **Behemoth** ) as listed on the Monster
Reference card or on the appropriate Minion board space.
**2. Preparation**
Sauron draws a number of cards equal to his combatant’s
**fortitude** from the appropriate Monster Combat deck. The
hero player then announces how much of his **agility** he will be
spending, and draws that number of cards from his life pool.

**Each unspent agility gives the hero +1 strength** until the end
of the combat.

**3. Rounds of Combat**
Each round, both players play a **Combat card** facedown from
their hand; the cards are simultaneously revealed, abilities
resolved, and both combatants are dealt damage. Repeat until
one combatant is **defeated** or both combatants are **exhausted**.

```
Each combat round consists of the following parts:
a. Choose Cards: Each combatant chooses and plays facedown
one card from his hand. An exhausted combatant may not
play additional cards, and skips this part.
```
```
b. Reveal Cards: Cards are simultaneously turned faceup. Each
player then places his card faceup on his combat stack.
If one of the players is exhausted , only his opponent reveals a
card. The exhausted player has 0 attack, 0 defense, no card
ability, and his combat type is neither melee nor ranged.
```
```
c. Calculate Strength: Both players add up the cumulative
strength cost of all cards in their combat stack. If this
exceeds the combatant’s strength, that combatant
immediately becomes exhausted and his card is canceled.
If both combatants become exhausted , neither combatant is
defeated; proceed to step 4.
```
```
d. Previous Round Abilities: If the card text of any card
played in the previous combat denotes “ Next Round ,” then
those abilities are resolved at this time (unless otherwise
specified), first by the hero and then by Sauron.
If one of the combatants became exhausted this round, his
previous round ability is canceled.
```
```
e. Current Round Abilities: All abilities from cards that were
played during this round are now resolved, first by the hero
and then by Sauron.
f. Deal Damage: Each combatant is simultaneously dealt
damage equal to his opponent’s total attack value minus his
own defense value.
If a combatant is defeated , proceed to step 4. Otherwise,
another combat round begins.
```
**4. Resolution**
After resolving all rounds of combat, perform these steps:

```
a. Discard Cards: The hero places his combat stack (with cards
in order) faceup on top of his rest pool. Sauron shuffles his
combat stack into the appropriate Monster Combat deck.
b. Discard Monster Token: If a monster token was involved,
discard it faceup next to the pile of unused tokens (whether
or not the monster was defeated). Undefeated minions
remain on their current location after combat.
```
```
c. Undefeated Monster or Minion: If the monster or minion
was not defeated, Sauron may immediately place an
amount of influence equal to his combatant’s wisdom in
extension of Shadow Strongholds. If this happens during a
hero’s Travel step, the hero’s turn immediately ends.
```
## Combat Keywords

```
Cancel: All card text is ignored, and the owner’s final attack
and defense value become 0 and may not be modified above 0.
A canceled card’s strength cost is not reduced. 2 cards that
cancel each other are both blank with 0 attack and defense.
```
```
Deal [X] Damage: Direct damage is dealt when the ability is
resolved, although combatants cannot be defeated until the
Deal Damage part of the round.
```
```
Modifying Attack or Defense: Modify the card’s final attack or
defense values for the Deal Damage step of a combat round.
```
```
If Opponent’s Printed (Attack or Defense) Is [X]: The attack or
defense values of the opponent’s cards are always derived from
the other card’s printed (not modified) value.
```
```
Reduce to 0: If attack or defense is reduced to 0, this value
cannot be increased above 0 (ignore any modifiers).
Types: Each card is either Ranged (blue) or Melee (red).
```
## Exhausted Combatants

```
A combatant who plays a Combat card that causes the
cumulative strength of the cards in his combat stack to exceed
his strength becomes exhausted.
```
```
When a player becomes exhausted during step c. Calculate
Strength , the Combat card he just played is canceled (the
attack and defense is reduced to 0 and any ability is ignored).
```
```
When one combatant is exhausted, his opponent continues to
resolve combat rounds until either a combatant is defeated,
or both combatants have become exhausted. Combat then
proceeds to step 4. Resolution.
```
```
Before the start of any combat round, if a combatant does not
have any—or does not wish to play any—combat cards in his
hand, he declares himself exhausted. If both combatants wish
to declare themselves exhausted in the same round, the hero
player must always do so first (and then Sauron may choose
whether he still wishes to do so).
```
```
An exhausted combatant remains exhausted for the duration
of the combat.
```
## Dealing Damage and Being Defeated

```
Monsters & Minions
For each damage a monster is dealt during combat, one
damage token is placed on its Monster Reference card. If
the number of tokens equals or exceeds the monster’s health
during step f. Deal Damage , the monster is defeated.
For each damage a minion is dealt, one damage token is
placed on its corresponding Minion space on the game board.
Damage tokens are not removed from a minion at the end of
combat and remain until the minion is healed or defeated.
```
```
If the number of tokens equals or exceeds the minion’s health,
it is defeated ; all damage tokens are removed from its Minion
space and its figure is removed from the game board.
```
```
Defeated minions do not return to the game, except for
the Ringwraiths who return to Minas Morgul at the start of
Sauron’s next Action step.
```
```
Dealing Damage to Heroes
A hero must discard one card from the top of his life pool
(without looking at it) or discard one card of his choice from
his hand, for each damage he is dealt. Discarded cards are
placed (one at a time) facedown into the hero’s damage pool.
```
```
If a hero has 0 cards in his life pool and 0 cards in his hand,
he is immediately defeated.
```
```
Defeated Heroes
A defeated hero performs the following steps:
```
**1. Advance Sauron’s Story:** The leftmost Sauron story marker
    is advanced one space up the Story Track. If multiple
    tokens are tied, the hero may decide which to move.
**2. Lose Favor or Item card:** The hero must choose whether to
    discard one favor token from his hero sheet or one of his
    Item cards. If a hero has neither, skip this step.
**3. Move to Haven:** The hero figure is moved to the closest
    Haven (by number of locations). If multiple Havens are
    equally close, Sauron decides which of the tied Havens.
**4. Recover:** The hero shuffles all cards from his rest pool and
    damage pool into his life pool.
**5. End Turn:** The hero’s turn immediately and play proceeds to
    the next player.

## tHe Finale

```
Once the Finale begins, follow these steps instead of normal turns:
```
**1. Check for Immediate Victory**
The _dominant_ side reveals its **Mission card**. If the criteria are
fulfilled, the dominant side immediately wins the game.

```
If neither side is dominant, both sides reveal their Mission
cards. If only one of the sides is able to fulfill the criteria on
its Mission card, then that side immediately wins the game.
If neither side has won the game, proceed to the next step.
```
**2. Advance Story Markers**
If Sauron fulfills his Mission card requirement, he advances
each of his story markers one space on the Story Track. If
the heroes fulfill their Mission card, they advance their story
marker one space on the Story Track. A story marker located
on the Finale space does not advance.
**3. Prepare**
Sauron removes all prior damage from the Ringwraiths’ Minion
space on the board. Each hero then shuffles all cards from
his hand, rest pool, and damage pool into his life pool, then
draws a number of cards from the top of his life pool equal to
his **fortitude**.
**4. Adjust Difficulty**
If one team is dominant, the Ringwraiths’ attributes are
modified as follows:
    **Sauron Dominant:** The Ringwraiths gain a number of both
    health and fortitude equal to the number of spaces the hero
    story marker is away from the Finale space.
    **Heroes Dominant:** The Ringwraiths’ health and fortitude
    is reduced by the _lower_ of the following 2 numbers: the
    number of spaces the closest Sauron story marker is from
    the Finale space; and the cumulative number of spaces
    needed for Sauron’s remaining story marker(s) to advance
    into _The Shadow Falls_ space.
**5. Choose Champion**
The heroes choose one hero player to fight the Ringwraith.
**6. Combat**
The chosen hero fights the Ringwraiths as normal.
**7. Determine Winner**
If the Ringwraiths are defeated, the heroes win the game.
If the Ringwraiths are not defeated, Sauron wins the game.

## two player GaMe

```
The hero player receives 2 turns for every Sauron turn. After
the hero finishes his first Encounter step, resolve a special
Hero Rally step and a Hero Draw step. The hero then receives
a second turn starting with his Rest step.
At the end of his second Encounter step, Sauron begins his
turn as normal (starting with the Hero Rally step). Sauron may
play one Shadow card during each of the hero’s 2 turns.
```
## optional ruleS

```
Advanced Dominance A side is dominant if it would require
fewer Story steps for it to reach the Finale. Calculate by
simulating a number of Story steps until a side has reached
the Finale with Sauron’s active Plot cards remaining in play.
```
```
High Stakes Stage III If the Heroes are dominant during stage
III, Sauron may decide which of his 3 markers is advanced
each time he defeats a hero. If Sauron is dominant during
stage III, the heroes advance their story marker one space
Story Track each time they defeat a minion.
```

## Sauron turn

**1. Hero Rally**
Discard all influence tokens from each hero’s location
(except if in a _Shadow Stronghold)._
**2. Story**

Advance the hero story marker 2 spaces up the Story Track
and Sauron’s story markers according to his active Plot
cards. _Skip this step on the first game turn._

If a marker reaches the **Finale** , or if all 3 of Sauron’s
markers reach **The Shadow Falls** , the game **Finale** begins.

**3. Plot**
Sauron may play a single Plot card from his hand to the
Active Plot Track or discard an active Plot card. _Skip this
step on the first game turn._

The number in the top left of the card is the _minimum
amount of influence_ that must be in the Shadow Pool.

**4. Event**
Sauron draws 3 cards from the current stage’s Event deck
and resolves one of them.

**Heroes are dominant** : resolve the card with the _lowest_
priority number. **Sauron is dominant** : resolve the card with
the _highest_ number. Neither side is dominant _(and during
the first game turn)_ , draw **one** card and resolve it.

Place any **favors** or **characters** listed on the designated
locations.

Cards with the **event marker icon** (green flag) are placed on
the **Current Event Card** space, discarding any card there,
and the event marker is placed on the designated location.

**5. Action**
Sauron may take 2 actions _(or 3 actions in a 4 player game_ )
by placing action tokens on the leftmost empty spaces of the
appropriate Action Tracks, then resolving the action.

When placing the fourth action token on the Action Track,
immediately remove the 3 prior tokens.

```
Place Influence equal to the number on the Action Track
space: up to 2 tokens in the Shadow Pool and the rest in
extension of Shadow Strongholds.
Draw Shadow and Plot Cards each equal to the number on
the Action Track space. Shadow cards go into your hand.
Keep only one of the drawn Plot cards, and place the rest
facedown at the bottom of the Plot deck in any order.
```
```
Receive Commands equal to the number on the Action
Track space. Each monster token and minion may only
receive one command per action. For each command:
```
```
Move Monster or Minion to an adjacent location. Monster
tokens may only be moved onto locations that contain at
least one influence token. Minions may move into Havens.
```
```
Draw a Monster Token from a monster token pile and
