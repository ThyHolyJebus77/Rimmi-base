## Factions/Civilizations
- Marquise de Cat: Industrial faction focused on building and resource exploitation
- Eyrie Dynasties: Rigid, powerful faction with an escalating decree system
- Woodland Alliance: Insurgent faction that spreads sympathy and revolts
- Vagabond: Adventurer faction that explores ruins and completes quests
- (Expansion) Riverfolk Company: Merchant faction that sells services to other players
- (Expansion) Lizard Cult: Religious faction that converts lost souls into gardens

## Additional Notes
Root has a steep learning curve due to its asymmetric nature, but offers deep strategic gameplay. The game is highly interactive and can be quite confrontational. Expansions add more factions and gameplay options.
