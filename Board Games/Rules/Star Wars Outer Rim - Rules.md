4. Reputation Management: Your standing with different factions can open up or close off opportunities. Sometimes it's beneficial to have negative reputation with certain factions.

5. Multi-use Cards: Many cards in the game serve multiple purposes. For example, crew members provide skills and special abilities.

6. Risk vs. Reward: Many decisions in the game involve weighing potential benefits against possible dangers. Don't be afraid to take calculated risks.

7. Narrative Elements: The game incorporates story elements through encounter cards and job resolutions. These add flavour and unpredictability to the gameplay.

8. Catch-up Mechanism: Players who are behind can often find ways to gain fame quickly, keeping the game competitive until the end.

9. Variable Game Length: While the standard game ends at 10 fame, players can adjust this for shorter or longer games.

10. Solo Play: The game includes rules for solo play against an AI opponent, allowing for single-player experiences.

# Star Wars Outer Rim - Rules
## SETUP

Use map tiles to build the map as shown in the rules.

Sort the patrol tokens by level (the white dots on the back).
Place each level 1 token faceup on the navpoint space (yellow
circle) adjacent to the endcap space with a matching faction
icon. Create 4 facedown stacks of the remaining tokens, one
for each faction, by arranging them in numerical order by level
(level 4 on the bottom and level 2 on the top). Place each stack of
tokens on the endcap space with a matching faction icon.

Mix together all the contact tokens facedown. Then place 1
facedown on each contact space on the map, ensuring that the
color and class (number of pips) on the space match the token.

Separate the credit, damage, and goal tokens into piles.

Each player rolls 6 dice. The player who rolled the most and
is the first player (on a tie, reroll). Starting with that player
and going clockwise around the table, each player chooses a
character and takes these components:

```
1 character card with Personal Goal side faceup.
1 matching character standee.
1 player board with a plastic fame marker on the 0 space
of the fame track.
4 reputation tokens (1 of each faction) on the reputation
tracks of the player board, each covering that faction’s icon.
1 starter ship sheet, flipped to the side of choice
(G9 Rigger or G-1A Starfighter)
1 reference card
Credit tokens: starting with the first player and going
clockwise, players receive 4,000 credits, 6,000 credits, 8,
credits, and 10,000 credits.
```
Players simultaneously follow the setup instructions at the
bottom of their character card. Each player takes the databank
card specified. If the card is labeled Cargo, place it above your
ship sheet in the Cargo slot. Otherwise, place the card below
your player board in one of the Job or Bounty slots.

Each player places their character standee on the map on the
starting planet listed on the databank card they drew.

If the setup instructions provide reputation, move the listed
faction’s reputation token up or down to the specified space
(either the or ).

Separate the market cards into 6 different decks by card back,
shuffle each deck, and place them facedown in a row below the
map. Then reveal the top card of each deck and place it faceup
on the top of its deck.

Separate the encounter cards into 7 different decks by card
back, shuffle each deck, and place them facedown next to the
map, near their corresponding planets.

Place the databank deck (in order) within reach of all players.

Place the unused ship sheets in a supply of unused ships.

When an encounter, market, or AI card is discarded, place it
facedown on the bottom of its deck. When a databank card is
discarded, return it to the deck in the proper place.

```
When a component is removed from the game, return it to the
box; it will not be used for the rest of the game.
```
```
Databank cards
The databank is a deck of numbered cards that is never
shuffled. Keep it in numeric order with the #1 cards on the top
and the #92 cards on the bottom. When you discard a databank
card, return it to the proper place.
If there are multiple cards with the same number (shown on the
card back as multiple dots under the number), draw a random
card of that number from the deck.
```
### GAME SEQUENCE

```
Starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player
takes a turn made up of 3 steps played in order.
```
### PLANNING STEP

```
Choose and resolve 1 of these options:
Move your character on the map.
Recover all damage from your character and ship. If you are
defeated, you must choose to recover damage.
Gain 2,000 credits.
```
```
You can resolve 1 ability preceded by the word Planning instead
of moving, gaining credits, or recovering damage.
```
### ACTION STEP

```
You may resolve any number of the 4 actions, but you can only
perform each action once per action step:
```
```
Trade: Exchange cards with another player in your space.
Market: If on a planet, buy a card from a market deck.
Deliver: Drop off cargo and bounty cards on their indicated
planet to gain rewards.
Resolve action abilities: Resolve any number of card abilities
preceded by the word Action. Each ability can be resolved
only once per action step.
```
### ENCOUNTER STEP

```
Choose one of these options:
Encounter a patrol: Choose to fight a ship combat against a
patrol token in your space. If you have negative reputation
with the patrol, you must encounter it and cannot perform
other types of encounters.
Encounter your space: Draw an encounter card matching
your space.
Encounter a contact: Reveal and encounter a contact token
on your planet. This will let you resolve a specific databank
card that often provides crew.
Resolve an encounter ability: If a card ability is preceded by
the word Encounter, resolve the ability on the card.
```
### MOVEMENT

```
Move your character on the map a number of spaces up to your
ship’s hyperdrive value.
There are 3 types of spaces: planet spaces, navpoint spaces,
and the Maelstrom space. Spaces are adjacent if they are
connected by a path.
```
```
If you move into the Maelstrom space, you must stop moving
(end your planning step and proceed to your action step).
```
```
If you move into a space with a patrol token, you must stop
moving unless you have positive reputation with its faction.
The Maelstrom and patrols interrupt your movement only when
you move into their space.
```
### ACTIONS

### TRADE

```
To make a trade action, choose another player in your space
and exchange bounties, cargo, crew, gear, jobs, and mods. Any
number of cards can trade hands, and the trade does not need
to be equal as long as both players agree to it.
```
```
If you are on the same space as multiple players, you can trade
with any of them, but the other players can only trade with you.
```
```
You can exchange credits with other players at any time
during your turn, from anywhere on the map, and even in the
middle of an action.
```
```
Any trade that cannot be completely and immediately fulfilled
is non-binding.
```
### MARKET

```
There are 6 market decks from which you can buy cards:
bounty , cargo , gear and mod , job , luxury ,
and ship.
```
```
You can only perform a market action if you are on a planet. You
may choose a market deck and discard the top card of that deck
(place it facedown on the bottom of the deck), then reveal the
top card of that deck and place it on top of the deck.
```
```
Whether or not you discard a card from a market deck, you may
choose to buy 1 card from the top of any market deck.
```
```
To buy a card, spend the amount of credits listed in the card’s
top right corner. Then place the card under your ship sheet or
player board in a slot that matches the card’s type. Each slot
can hold 1 card. If you do not have an empty slot of that type,
you may discard one of your cards to make room.
```
```
Patrols
After you buy a card, reveal the top card of that market deck
and place it on top of the deck.
```
```
If the revealed card has a patrol movement icon, you must
move that patrol. The faction indicates which patrol you move,
and the distance indicates how many spaces it moves toward
you. If there are multiple paths that lead toward you, choose the
path the patrol follows; but if the patrol can possibly move to
your space, it must move along the shortest path.
```
```
Patrols can move into and through the Maelstrom space and
can end their movement in any space (even a planet or the
same space as another patrol).
```
```
Bartering
When buying a card, you may discard any of your cargo, gear,
or mods to reduce the cost by the discarded cards’ cost (you do
not receive change).
```
```
When buying a ship, you always barter your existing ship and
use its cost (upper left corner of the ship sheet) as a discount
toward the ship you are purchasing.
You cannot gain credits back when bartering, you can only
reduce the cost to a minimum of 0 credits.
```
```
Buying ships
Cards in the market deck are usually new ships. When buying
a ship, retrieve its ship sheet from the supply of unused ships
and return your current ship sheet to the supply.
```
```
Place the new ship with its Ship Goal side faceup. Remove all
damage from your ship, and place all cards such as cargo, crew,
and mods in the appropriate slots of your new ship.
```
### DELIVER

```
Bounty and cargo cards, gained from market decks, need to be
brought to a specific planet to gain the reward.
```
```
To deliver cargo, you need to be on the Destination planet listed
and perform a deliver action to gain the listed reward. Then
discard the cargo card.
```
```
If you are delivering cargo with the ILLEGAL trait, you must roll a
die before they can deliver it. On a hit result, you deliver the
cargo and gain its reward. On any other result, you must resolve
card #1 from the databank instead of delivering the cargo.
If you have multiple cards to deliver to your current space, you
can deliver them all during the same deliver action (resolve
them in the order of your choice).
```
### ENCOUNTERS

### ENCOUNTER A PATROL

```
When you encounter a patrol, fight a ship combat against it.
If you lose the combat, move the patrol 1 space in any direction.
If you win, you lose 1 reputation with that patrol’s faction, then
gain the reward listed on the patrol token and remove the token
from the game. Then spawn 1 patrol of that faction.
To spawn a patrol, draw the top patrol token from that faction’s
stack and place it faceup in the space adjacent to that stack.
```
```
Level 4 patrols are invulnerable (– for combat value). They will
always deal enough damage to defeat the player’s ship, and
they always win combat (do not roll dice for the combat).
```
### ENCOUNTER YOUR SPACE

```
When you encounter your space, draw the top encounter
card from the deck matching your space. The front of each
encounter card has up to 3 different sections. Resolve the
section that matches your space and your current situation by
reading it aloud, and then discard the card.
```
```
When an effect on a card instructs you to gain a bounty, cargo,
crew, gear, job, or mod, instead of discarding the card, place it
in a matching slot of your player board or ship shee, tucking the
card under your board or sheet to cover up the other sections
on the encounter card.
If an encounter effect is labeled secret, read the card to yourself
(not aloud), and keep it hidden. You can resolve the secret’s
ability in the future by following the instructions. Keep your
secrets facedown on the table when you are not looking at
them. They do not take up slots on your ship sheet or player
board.
Some planets have faction icons on them. Encounter cards
on these planets commonly allow you to gain reputation with
that faction or reward you for having positive reputation with
that faction. Also, the back of the encounter cards provide an
overview of the most common rewards that appear on them.
```
### ENCOUNTER A CONTACT

```
Each planet has 2 contact tokens placed next to it at the start
of the game; these are considered to be on the planet. To
encounter a contact, choose 1 contact token on your planet
and flip it faceup.
```
```
Then, retrieve the databank card listed on the contact, read the
top section and resolve its ability.
```

The card may become a crew card. If you
gain the crew, tuck the card under your ship sheet in one of your
crew slots, so that only the crew portion of the card is visible.

If the ability did not allow you to keep the card, return it to the
deck.

Abilities may discard the contact from the map. If the ability
does not discard it, the token remains faceup in its space.
Any player can encounter this contact as normal during their
encounter step, and can look at a faceup contact tokens’s
corresponding databank card at any time.

Some contacts have faction icons ( ) or the droid icon
, which may be referenced by other abilities. Each token also has
a class (gray, green, or yellow) used by bounties.

Some abilities allow you to secretly look at a contact token.
Slide the token off the map and look at its face, being careful
not to show it to any other player. Then return the token
facedown to its planet. You cannot look at the contact’s
database card at this time. You can tell other players about the
information on the token (or lie about it), but you cannot show it
to any other player

### REPUTATION

There are 4 factions. Your reputation with each faction is
marked on your player board with a reputation token. Each can
be in one of 3 spaces on its reputation track:

```
Positive Reputation : The faction sees you as a valuable
ally. Effects from encounter cards and patrols may reward
you for this.
```
```
Neutral Reputation : The faction neither hates you nor
trusts you. You will not gain benefits or penalties.
```
```
Negative Reputation : The faction sees you as an enemy
and a threat. Effects from encounter cards and patrols may
punish you for this.
```
When you gain a reputation with a faction, move its token 1
space up toward the positive space.

When you lose a reputation with a faction, move its token 1
space down toward the negative space.

If you have positive reputation with a faction, any additional
reputation gained has no effect. If you have negative reputation
with a faction, any additional reputation lost has no effect.

### SKILL TESTS

As a player, you have all skills shown at the bottom of your
character card plus any shown on your crew.

You can always perform a skill test, even if you do not have the
specified skill. Roll 2 dice: you need to roll at least one of the
necessary results in order to pass. The results needed depend
on whether you have that skill:

```
Unskilled (you don’t have the skill):
You need at least 1 crit to pass.
Skilled (you have the skill once):
You need at least 1 crit or hit to pass.
Highly Skilled (you have the skill more than once):
You need at least 1 crit , hit , or focus to pass.
```
The effect of passing or failing a test is defined on the card.
If a test only has a pass effect or only has a fail effect, the
outcome of the missing effect is that nothing happens.

### COMBAT

```
Players cannot attack each other unless a card specifically
allows a player to fight another player.
```
```
There are 2 types of combat:
Ground combat: Use your character’s ground combat and
health.
Ship combat: Use your ship’s combat and hull.
```
```
When fighting a patrol, the combat is always a ship combat.
When fighting combat against another player (when allowed by
a card), fight a ground combat if you are on a planet, or a ship
combat if not on a planet.
```
```
The attacker (the player taking their turn) rolls attack dice equal
to their combat value and totals the amount of damage rolled.
Each hit is 1 damage, and each crit is 2 damage.
Focus results deal no damage, but may be used by card
abilities.
```
```
After the attacker totals their rolled damage, the defender
performs the same process. Then, each player suffers damage
equal to the amount of damage rolled by their opponent.
When a character suffers damage, place that number of damage
tokens on that character card. When a ship suffers damage,
place that number of damage tokens on that ship sheet.
```
```
The combat ends after both sides suffer their damage. If either
player has an effect that requires a winner to be declared, the
winner is the player that rolled the most damage. On a tie, the
attacker wins.
```
```
Patrols
When you are fighting a combat against a patrol or card, the
player seated to your left rolls dice and makes decisions for that
defender. Patrols and card enemies do not suffer damage, but
have effects based on whether they win or lose the combat.
```
```
There is always 1 patrol of each faction on the map, and any
number of patrols can exist in the same space.
```
### DEFEATED

```
When your character suffers damage equal to your health,
or your ship suffers damage equal to your hull, you become
defeated.
```
```
Tip your standee over in your current space. Then lose 3,
credits and discard all of your secrets. Finish the current step
of your turn, but skip any actions or steps you have not started
resolving.
During your next planning step, you must choose the option to
recover all damage instead of moving, gaining credits, or using a
Planning ability. Stand your character back up on the map—you
are no longer defeated.
```
```
If an ability allows you to recover damage before the planning
step, and this causes you to no longer have enough damage to
be defeated, stand your character back up.
```
### PERSONAL GOALS

```
When you complete your character’s personal goal, gain 1 fame
, then flip your character card over. The goal is now replaced
by a new ability you can use.
```
```
If a goal requires you to perform a certain task a number of
times, track this by placing a goal token on your character card
each time you complete the task. When you flip the card over,
discard all goal tokens on it.
```
```
All ships bought during the game have ship goals on them,
which function just like personal goals. By completing the goal
on a ship, you can gain fame and flip the sheet over to gain a
new ability (and a legendary name).
```
### JOBS

```
Some characters start with a job card, and more can be gained
from the market deck.
```
```
Above each job’s name is a list of the skills that will be tested
when attempting it. A skill in italic means that failing this test
will likely result in failing the job (you can still attempt the test
even if you don’t have the skill)..
```
```
To attempt a job, you must be in the destination listed on the
card at the start of your encounter step. As your encounter for
the turn, you may follow the instructions on the job card.
```
```
If you are instructed to resolve a specific databank card, that
card will list a series of steps you must perform to complete the
job. Read the card aloud, starting with step #1 and stopping
if you are required to perform a test or fight a combat. After
resolving a step on the card, continue to the next consecutive
step unless instructed to do otherwise.
```
```
If you are defeated, the job fails. When a job fails, your turn
ends (do not resolve any more steps on the card). Return the
databank card to the deck, but keep the job card—you can
attempt it on a future turn.
```
```
When you complete a job, return the databank card to the deck
and gain the reward specified on the job, then either discard the
job card or remove it from the game as instructed.
```
```
If the job requires you to fight a combat and you’re defeated,
the job fails. If you are not defeated, continue resolving the job.
The databank card may specify other instructions.
```
### BOUNTIES

```
Some characters start with a bounty card, and more can be
gained from the market deck.
```
```
To gain rewards from a bounty, find the contact specified on the
card, then fight it.
```
```
Each contact token has a class on its back (a number of colored
pips), also shown on its bounty card. Use this information to
help you find your target.
```
```
You normally draw and resolve a contact’s database card when
you encounter a contact. However, if the contact token matches
one of your bounty cards, you can choose to fight it instead.
```
```
The contact’s combat value is listed on the bounty card, as well
either a ship or ground combat icon (fight this type of combat).
The player seated to your left rolls dice for the contact.
```
```
If you win the combat, either eliminate the contact (remove
the token from the game) and gain the elimination reward, or
capture it (place the token on the bounty card).
```
```
You can deliver the captured contact token to a specific planet
to gain the capture reward. After you deliver the captured
token, remove the token from the game.
```
```
If you win the combat and are defeated in the same combat,
you eliminate or capture the contact before you are defeated.
```
```
After you gain the reward from a bounty, remove the card from
the game. If you lose the combat, keep the bounty card; the
contact token remains on the planet.
```
### BOUNTIES ON CREW

```
If you have a bounty for your own crew card, you can fight
a combat against that crew as your encounter during your
encounter step. The crew uses the combat value on your bounty
card as normal.
```
```
If you win, return the crew card to the databank and either
capture or eliminate its contact token.
```
```
If you lose, return the crew card to the databank and place its
contact token in the nearest empty contact space.
```
```
When you are fighting a combat against one of your own crew,
you cannot use that crew’s abilities or skills.
```
```
If you have a bounty for another player’s crew card, you can
fight a combat against that crew as your encounter during your
encounter step, but only if you are in that player’s space.
```
```
At the start of combat, that player chooses whether they wish to
protect the crew.
```
```
If they protect the crew, fight a combat against that player
instead: a ground combat if you are on a planet; and a ship
combat if you are at a navpoint space or the Maelstrom.
```
```
If they do not protect the crew, fight the combat against the
crew. The player to your left rolls dice for the crew, using the
combat type and value on your bounty card.
```
```
Regardless of whether they protect the crew or not, if you
win the combat, discard the crew card and either capture or
eliminate its contact token. If you lose, they keep the crew and
there is no additional effect.
```
### WINNING THE GAME

```
Each time you gain fame, advance your fame marker by the
amount gained.
The first player to acquire 10 fame wins. The game ends as
soon as a player acquires enough fame to win.
```
```
On a tie, the tiedplayer with the most credits wins the game. On
a further tie, the tied player seated farthest (clockwise) from the
player who started the game wins.
```
```
If an abilities affect the most famous player and multiple players
are tied for the most fame, they are all considered the most
famous player.
```
### OPTIONS

```
Extended game
A player wins by acquiring 12 fame instead of 10.
```
```
Random map
Before setup, if all players agree, perform these steps instead of
using the map in the rules:
```
1. Randomise (with eyes closed) all 6 map tiles in a facedown
    stack.
2. Flip over the top tile, and attach it to the Rebel and
    Syndicate patrol endcap.
3. One at a time, flip over a map tile and connect it to the
    previously drawn tile. Connect the Hutt and Imperial endcap
    to the last tile placed.


### GAME SEQUENCE

### PLANNING STEP

Choose and resolve 1 of these options:

```
Move your character on the map.
```
```
Recover all damage from your character and ship. If
you are defeated, you must choose to recover damage.
```
```
Gain 2,000 credits.
```
You can resolve 1 ability preceded by the word Planning
instead of these options.

### ACTION STEP

You may resolve any number of the 4 actions, but only
each action once per action step:

```
Trade: Exchange cards with a player in your space.
```
```
Market: On a planet, buy from a market deck.
```
```
Deliver: Drop off cargo and bounty cards on their
indicated planet to gain rewards.
```
```
Resolve action abilities.
```
### ENCOUNTER STEP

Choose one of these options:

```
Encounter a patrol: Fight a ship combat against a
patrol token in your space. If you have negative
reputation with the patrol, you must encounter it and
cannot perform other types of encounters.
```
```
Encounter your space: Draw an encounter card.
```
```
Encounter a contact: Reveal and encounter a contact
token on your planet.
```
```
Resolve an encounter ability.
```
### MOVEMENT

Move your character a number of spaces up to your
ship’s hyperdrive value.

If you move into the Maelstrom, you must stop.

If you move into a space with a patrol token, you must
stop moving unless you have positive reputation with
its faction.

### ACTIONS

### TRADE

Choose another player in your space and exchange
bounties, cargo, crew, gear, jobs, and mods.

You can exchange credits with players at any time.

### MARKET

```
There are 6 market decks from which you can buy cards:
bounty , cargo , gear and mod , job , luxury
, and ship.
```
```
You can only perform a market action if you are on a
planet.
```
```
You may discard the top card of a deck, then reveal a
new top card. Then you may buy 1 card from the top of
any market deck.
```
```
You may discard any of your cargo, gear, or mods to
reduce the cost by the discarded cards’ cost.
```
```
Spend the amount of credits then place the card in a
matching slot.
```
```
Then, reveal the top card of that market deck and place
it on top of the deck. If it has a patrol movement icon,
move that patrol toward you. Patrols can move through
the Maelstrom space and can end their movement in
any space.
```
```
When buying a ship, you always barter your existing ship.
```
### DELIVER

```
To deliver, you need to be on the Destination planet listed
and perform a deliver action to gain the reward.
```
```
If you are delivering cargo with the ILLEGAL trait, roll a die
before delivering: on a hit , you deliver the cargo and
gain its reward.
On any other result, resolve databank card #1 instead
of delivering.
```
### ENCOUNTERS

### ENCOUNTER A PATROL

```
Fight a ship combat. If you lose, move the patrol 1 space
in any direction. If you win, lose 1 reputation with that
patrol’s faction, then gain the reward listed on the patrol
token and remove the token from the game. Then spawn
1 patrol of that faction.
```
```
Level 4 patrols are invulnerable. They will always deal
enough damage to defeat your ship, and always win
combat (do not roll dice).
```
### ENCOUNTER YOUR SPACE

```
Draw an encounter card from the deck matching your
space and resolve the section that matches your space
and your current situation.
```
### ENCOUNTER A CONTACT

```
Choose 1 contact token on your planet and flip it faceup.
Then retrieve the listed databank card, read the top
section and resolve its ability.
```
### SKILL TESTS

```
Roll 2 dice:
Unskilled (you don’t have the skill):
You need at least 1 crit to pass.
Skilled (you have the skill once):
You need at least 1 crit or hit to pass.
Highly Skilled (you have the skill more than once):
You need at least 1 crit , hit , or focus to pass.
```
### COMBAT

```
Ground combat: Use your character’s ground combat
and health.
Ship combat: Use your ship’s combat and hull.
When fighting a patrol, the combat is always a ship
combat. When fighting combat against another player
(when allowed by a card), fight a ground combat if you
are on a planet, or a ship combat if not on a planet.
The attacker rolls attack dice equal to their combat value
and totals the damage. Each hit is 1 damage, and
each crit is 2 damage. Focus deal no damage, but
may be used by card abilities.
```
```
The defender then performs the same process. Then,
each player suffers damage equal to the amount of
damage rolled by their opponent.
The combat ends after both sides suffer their damage.
If either player has an effect that requires a winner to be
declared, the winner is the player that rolled the most
damage. On a tie, the attacker wins.
```
### DEFEATED

```
When your character suffers damage equal to your
health, or your ship suffers damage equal to your hull,
you are defeated.
```
```
Tip your standee over in your current space. Then lose
3,000 credits and discard all of your secrets. Finish the
current step of your turn, but skip any actions or steps
you have not started resolving.
```
```
During your next planning step, you must choose the
option to recover all damage. Stand your character back
up on the map.
```
### PERSONAL GOALS

```
When you complete your character’s personal goal, gain
1 fame , then flip your character card over.
```
### WINNING THE GAME

```
The first player to 10 fame wins.
```

### SINGLE-PLAYER GAME

Setup
Set up all components for the AI as if they were a player.
After choosing your character, choose a character to
play against. It must be a character that starts the game
with databank card #91 or #92, and it chooses the G
Rigger as its starting ship.

You are the first player. You gain 4,000 credits and the
AI gains 6,000 credits. Follow the setup instructions on
the AI’s character card. Then place a goal token on the
destination listed on their cargo or job. Shuffle the AI
cards into a facedown deck, and place it near the AI’s
character card.

Playing the game
During the game, resolve your turn as normal. At the end
of each of your turns, the AI takes a turn: draw the top
card of the AI deck and resolve it, starting at the top and
proceeding downward.

If instructed to do the first that applies, resolve the top
bullet in that section, if possible. If this bullet would have
no effect or cannot be resolved, resolve the next bullet
instead and so forth.

If instructed to do all that apply, resolve each bullet in
that section from top to bottom. Skip any bullets that
would have no effect or cannot be resolved.

After resolving the card, discard it. Then resolve your
turn as normal.

The first player to 10 fame wins the game.

AI player’s cards and credits
Keep track of the AI’s fame, credits, and cards as if it
were a real player. The AI does not use abilities on cards,
except for abilities that increase the values of their ship
or character. They do not complete personal goals or
ship goals.

AI goals
The AI uses goal tokens to mark planets it can
deliver cargo to or complete jobs on. These are
used to determine where the AI will move on its
turn.

The AI’s first goal token is placed during setup on the
destination planet of the starting cargo or job. Additional
goal tokens are placed by AI cards.

Moving
The AI always moves toward the nearest goal token on
the map. If their space contains a goal token, they do
not move.

If there are multiple paths available, they move in the
direction that leaves them the fewest number of spaces
from their goal as possible. They do not choose a longer
path to avoid patrols.

```
If there are multiple paths of equal length, the AI prefers:
```
```
1) the path that has no patrol to stop their movement
and
```
```
2) if no patrol would interrupt their movement, the space
that is a planet. If both are planets, decide randomly.
The AI player can move through the Maelstrom as if it
were a navpoint space.
If the AI would end their movement on a navpoint
space after moving a number of spaces equal to their
hyperdrive value, they will move 1 or 2 fewer spaces if
doing so allows them to end their movement on a planet
instead.
```
```
If the AI could end their movement on a planet by moving
1 fewer space and could also end their movement on a
planet by moving 2 fewer spaces, they will move 1 fewer
space.
```
```
Buying
The AI can only buy when it is on a planet.
```
```
When buying, the AI resolves these steps:
```
1. Before buying, the AI discards the faceup card of the
specified deck if any of these apply:
- The card cannot be bought on the current planet.
- The AI does not have enough credits to buy it. They
    discard the top card regardless of how many credits
    they have, even if they do not have enough credits to
    afford any card in the deck.
- The AI does not have any empty slots matching it.
    They discard the top card regardless of whether that
    deck has any cards that can be placed in different
    slots.
- The AI is buying from the market deck and the
    card doesn’t cost more than the AI’s current ship.
2. The AI buys the top card of that deck and places it
in an open slot. The AI will not buy a card if they do not
have an empty slot matching the card.
They will buy an asset it cannot use, but will will never
buy a ship unless it costs more than their current ship.
The AI player always barters using its ship, but never
barters with assets.

```
If the AI buys the Used Ship for Sale card, it will choose
to buy the most expensive ship it can afford (if there are
several, choose one randomly).
```
3. After buying a card, reveal the top card of that market
deck and resolve patrol movement icons on the revealed
card, moving the patrol toward the AI.

```
The AI will always move the patrol toward their space
along the shortest path possible.
```
```
Jobs and cargo
To complete a job, the AI resolves the reward section
of the job card, but does not draw a databank card and
does not perform any tests.
```
```
AI cards may allow the AI to deliver cargo when at the
cargo’s destination. Resolve the reward section of the
cargo and then discard the card. Multiple cargo with the
same destination can be delivered at the same time.
```
```
When the AI delivers illegal cargo, do not roll a die. AI
cards may have the AI suffer damage when they deliver
illegal cargo.
```
```
Gaining crew
Follow all normal rules for crew, but the AI does not fully
resolve the contact token’s databank cards. Instead,
draw the databank card and if there is a crew asset on
the card, place the crew in an empty crew slot on the
AI ship.
If the AI does not have any empty crew slots, it randomly
discards 1 of its crew to make room for the new crew.
If the databank card does not have crew on it, discard
the card.
```
```
AI cards always instruct you to reveal facedown contact
tokens. If there are no facedown contact tokens on the
planet, resolve the lowest class (fewest pips) faceup
contact token on the planet. If there are 2 facedown or 2
faceup contact tokens of the same class on the planet,
resolve the leftmost token.
```
```
The AI does not protect crew from bounties.
```
```
AI decisions
If one of your card abilities forces the AI to make a
decision, the AI always chooses not to participate
when possible. If the AI is forced to make a mandatory
decision, randomly determine the outcome.
```
```
Clarifications
The AI must obey all rules that apply to normal players
unless specified otherwise.
```
```
If the AI is defeated during their turn, they do not resolve
any subsequent bullets on their AI card; instead they
finish resolving the bullet on the AI card that they were
resolving when they were defeated, and then their turn
ends.
```
```
Expert mode
You can increase the challenge by having the AI start
with some fame.
```
```
You can play the extended game with the AI (by playing
to 12 fame, but this may make the game easier.
```

### UNFINISHED BUSINESS EXPANSION

### SETUP

Add the expansion cards to the character, encounter (replace
Takodana card #10 from the base game with card #10 from this
expansion), market, and databank card decks.

When building the map, use the Core Worlds endcaps instead
of the base game ones. Shuffle the Core Worlds encounter deck
and place it near one of the endcaps. When setting up patrols,
the Rebel and Syndicate patrols start on the same navpoint on
the Spinward Core endcap, and the Hutt and Imperial patrols
start on the same navpoint on the Trailing Core endcap. When
new patrols are spawned, they spawn on those same spaces,
respectively.

When placing contact tokens on planets, randomize the orange
contact tokens and place 1 facedown on each planet (not on
contact spaces). Do not place them on Core Worlds spaces.

Give each player one of the new reference cards.

Databank cards
The new databank cards are added to the deck in numeric
order. Pips on the back indicate how many copies there are of
each card. However, this expansion adds cards that make some
of those pips inaccurate.

Every job now has 2 resolution cards in the databank, even
though some of these databank cards only have 1 pip on
them. When a job card instructs a player to resolve a specific
databank card, they find the 2 cards, shuffle them, and draw 1
at random.

There are now 4 starting cargo cards (card #91) and 4 starting
job cards (card #92).

### CORE WORLDS

Players may visit the Core Worlds and cross through them to
reach the opposite end of the galaxy by entering one of the 2
Core Worlds spaces: the Spinward Core or the Trailing Core.

Each of these spaces is a planet space for all game purposes.
Players can move to these spaces, perform market actions on
them, and encounter them.

Both Core Worlds spaces share an encounter deck. During a
player’s turn, if they choose to encounter their space while on
a Core Worlds space, they draw the top card of the Core Worlds
encounter deck and resolve it. Before you draw a Core Worlds
encounter, you must announce if you intend to cross to the
other side of the galaxy. If you do, resolve the Across the Core
section of the encounter card. If you do not (or do not announce
that you intend to cross), resolve the Core Worlds section.

The Across the Core section details the requirements that need
to be fulfilled for a player to move directly to the Core Worlds
space on the other side of the galaxy,

When you are to “move to the other Core Worlds space,” move
your standee to the Core Worlds space on the opposite end of
the map. There is an icon on each Core Worlds space to remind
players of this.

```
A player who moves from one Core Worlds space to the other via
an Across the Core encounter has not moved through any other
spaces during this movement.
```
```
When determining the nearest player, space, or component,
players do not count through the Core Worlds.
When resolving patrol movement icons, patrols cannot cross
through the Core Worlds and they cannot move from one Core
Worlds space to the other.
```
### CONTACT TOKENS

```
All rules that apply to contact tokens also apply to orange
contact tokens. If a player encounters a contact token that
matches their own or another player’s character card, they
discard the token immediately without resolving its databank
card or fighting the contact for a bounty. Then, they resolve a
different encounter of their choice (such as encountering their
space or a different contact token).
```
```
A player may gain a bounty card that matches a player’s
character card. Because contact tokens that match characters
in play are discarded, they will not be able to complete that
bounty by locating its contact token as normal.
```
```
Instead, the player with the bounty can choose, as their
encounter for their turn, to fight that character if they are in
the same space. In a planet space, they fight a ground combat;
otherwise they fight a ship combat. If the player with the bounty
wins, they complete the bounty. Otherwise, they keep the
bounty and can attempt to complete it on a future turn.
```
```
When a player completes a bounty for another player’s
character, they ignore all rewards and other effects listed on the
bounty card. Instead, they perform these steps:
```
1. Gain 5,000.
2. Gain 1 fame.
3. If the defending player has negative reputation with one
    or more factions, the player completing the bounty chooses
    one of those factions to gain 1 reputation with.
4. If the defending player has positive reputation with one or
    more factions, the player completing the bounty chooses one
    of those factions to lose 1 reputation with.

```
After completing the bounty, remove it from the game.
```
```
Unlike a bounty for a contact, a player does not have the option
to capture another player’s character.
```
```
A player cannot complete a bounty for their own character, but
they may gain their character’s bounty card to prevent other
players from attempting to complete it.
```
### MULTI-PLAYER JOBS

```
Some jobs require 2 players to work together to complete them.
A player with one of these jobs must have another player in
their space while at the specified destination to attempt the job.
During the job, if a decision must be made, the current player
makes that decision. If any player involved in the job is defeated
during the job, the job fails.
```
### OPPOSED JOBS

```
Some jobs allow a player to attempt to take credits or assets
from another player. These jobs each list a skill as (opposed),
which means that both players test this skill during the job. The
best result for the player with the job is for them to pass their
test and their opponent to fail their test.
```
### MARKET ACTION DISCARDS

```
During the Discard a Card step of a market action, after the
current player discards a card, they may choose to discard a
second card from the same market deck.
```
```
They do not resolve any patrol movement icons or reveal
contact icons on the newly revealed card, as normal.
```
### REVEAL CONTACT ICONS

```
Some market cards have a reveal contact icon. The current
player resolves this icon when the card is flipped faceup after a
player buys or gains a card from the market.
```
```
When one of these icons is resolved, if the number of players in
the game is included in the range of numbers displayed by the
icon, the current player must choose 1 facedown contact on
their planet and turn it faceup, if able. They do not encounter
that contact, though they may do so during their encounter step
as normal.
```
```
If a player flips a contact that matches any player’s character,
they remove that contact from the game and flip another token.
```
```
If a player is not on a planet when they resolve a reveal contact
icon, that icon has no effect.
```
### ROTATING ASSETS

```
Some market cards have assets at both ends of the card. Each
of these cards has an arrow in the upper left corner of one of the
assets indicating that this is the starting asset for the card.
```
```
When a player buys or gains one of these cards from the
market, they pay the cost of the starting asset and place the
card in a slot so that the starting asset is visible and the other
asset is tucked under their ship sheet or player board.
```
```
Abilities on the top or bottom of the card may instruct the player
to rotate this card. To do so, they turn the card 180º so that the
other asset on the card is right side up. The card remains in the
slot that it was in.
```
```
If a player gains a rotating asset from another player through
a trade or other game effect, that card maintains the same
orientation. If a rotated asset is discarded, it is returned to the
appropriate deck in the same orientation as cards in that deck.
```
### OPTIONAL RULES

### FAVORS

```
A player can request favors from their opponents, even if they
are not in the same space. These requests can be made at any
time except after dice are rolled for a combat or skill test. Each
player can only receive 1 favor per turn.
```
```
Advice: Choose a skill to gain for your next skill test during the
current turn. The chosen skill must be on the character or a
crew of the player who is granting the favor.
Combat Strategy: Roll one additional die in a combat involving
your character or ship.
Endorsement: Choose a faction that the player who is granting
the favor has positive reputation with. You are treated as
having positive reputation with the chosen faction until the end
of the turn.
```
```
Shortcut: Gain +1 hyperdrive until the end of the turn.
If any player agrees to grant a favor, the requesting player gains
that favor’s effect. If multiple players offer to grant the favor, the
requesting player chooses which offer to accept.
```
```
Debt tokens represent a promise of a future favor to another
player. If using the favors rule, each player takes the debt token
that matches the color of their player board during setup. Like
credits, debt tokens can be traded at any time. A player can
even trade debt tokens they have from other players.
```
```
A player can gain a favor of their choice from another player
by returning that player’s debt token to them. The player who
received the debt token must grant the favor.
```
```
A player can offer compensation to other players in exchange
for being granted a favor. Compensation can include debt
tokens and credits. A player can also offer to give assets to
or trade assets with another player in their space. They can
even offer future promises, but any agreement that cannot be
immediately fulfilled is nonbinding.
```
```
Players cannot request favors from themselves. Players can give
other players credits not to provide a favor to another player,
but such agreements are non-binding.
```
### AMBITIONS

```
Before setup, players agree on a fame requirement: the amount
of fame needed to win the game. Use a requirement of 8 instead
of 10 unless you desire a longer game.
During setup, players do not gain starting credits. Place,
faceup on the table, random ambition sheets equal to the
number of players plus 1. Then, starting with the last player
and proceeding in reverse turn order, each player chooses 1
ambition sheet and places it beside their player board. When all
players have chosen a sheet, return the last sheet to the box.
Then, each player follows the setup instructions on their
ambition sheet. These benefits are in addition to each
character’s setup instructions. Sheets that provide market
cards indicate in which market deck that card can be found.
After searching a deck for a card, shuffle that deck.
```
```
Ambition goals
Each ambition sheet lists several goals that a player must
complete to win the game. Each is preceded by one of the
following, which indicates when that goal can be completed:
```
- Dash (–): Can be completed at any time.
- Number: Must be completed in numeric order.
- Infinity Symbol (∞): Ongoing goals that are only complete
    while their criteria are met. They can be completed at any
    time but are no longer complete if the criteria for the goal are
    no longer met.
- Fame Symbol ( ): This final goal can only be completed
    after you have an amount of fame greater than or equal to
    the fame requirement and have completed all other goals.
Some goals provide a player with an encounter ability, which
specifies how the goal is completed, and these may also
specify a destination. You must be at the specified destination
to resolve the encounter ability for that goal. If the encounter
instructs you to resolve a databank card, that card is resolved in
the same way as a databank card for a job. If you are defeated
while resolving that card, the encounter fails and you must try
again on a future turn.

```
When you complete a goal, place a goal token on your ambition
sheet in the progress tracker space for that goal. If you no
longer meet the criteria for a ∞ goal, remove the goal token
from that goal’s progress tracker space.
When you have completed all of your ambition goals and met
the fame requirement, you win the game.
```

### SINGLE-PLAYER RULES

When using this expansion for a single-player game, the
following rules apply:

Setup: Remove Disable Comms Network,Honest Robbery, Sail
Barge Sabotage, and Snatch and Grab from the jobs market
deck. Remove card 11 from the Ring of Kafrene/Takodana
encounter deck.

Preparing the AI deck: Each character has its own unique AI
card. During setup, choose a character to play against and
prepare its AI deck according to which databank card it begins
the game with:

#90: Follow the setup instructions under Bounter Hunter AI
Opponents on the right.

#91 or #92: Shuffle the character’s AI card into the base
game AI cards numbered 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9 in the lower-right
corner.

Core Worlds: The AI player cannot move through the Core
Worlds.

Discarding from the market: Before buying a card from the
market, the AI player can discard up to 2 cards according to the
single-player AI buying rules.

Cargo with a patrol destination: The AI player does not buy
cargo with a patrol as its destination.

Rotating cargo: When the AI player delivers a cargo that
rotates, they rotate that card and move its goal token to the new
destination.

Reveal contact icons: When the AI player resolves a reveal
contact icon after buying a card from the market, they flip the
facedown contact token on their planet with the lowest class
(fewest pips on its back) faceup. If there is more than 1 eligible
token of the same class, choose one at random.

Contacts for player characters: If an AI player reveals a contact
token that matches a player’s character, discard that token and
repeat the instruction that caused the token to be revealed.

Favors: The favors optional rule cannot be used.

Ambitions: If playing with ambitions, the AI player does not use
an ambition sheet. Instead, they begin the game with 6,
and must earn 2 additional fame to win the game. To choose
your ambition sheet, draw 2 and choose 1 to use.

### BOUNTY HUNTER AI OPPONENTS

### SETUP

Follow standard setup for a single-player game with these
changes:

- Choose a character that starts the game with databank card
    #90 for the AI player.
- Shuffle the chosen character’s AI card into the bounty hunter
    AI deck (cards 1 through 5). Return all other AI cards to the
    game box.
- The AI player chooses the G-1A Starfighter as its starting ship.

### PLAYING THE GAME

The bounty hunter AI deck functions the same as the base
game AI deck.

To resolve the AI player’s turn, draw the top card of the AI deck
and resolve it, starting at the top and proceeding downward.

### HUNTING BOUNTIES

```
All bounty hunter AI cards instruct the AI player to move toward
or encounter a bounty target: a character, crew, or contact that
matches one of the AI player’s bounties. If the AI player has
a bounty that does not match any character, crew, or faceup
contact token on the map, the nearest facedown contact token
that matches that bounty’s class (white, green, yellow, or
orange) is considered to match that bounty.
```
```
When the AI has multiple bounty targets, it uses this priority:
```
1. Character
2. Crew
3. Faceup contact of the lowest class (fewest pips)
4. Facedown contact of the lowest class (fewest pips)
If there are multiple bounty targets of the same priority, the
AI player chooses the nearest one. If 2 bounty targets with the
same priority are the same distance away, the AI player chooses
one of them at random.

### ENCOUNTERS

```
Each encounter results in the AI player resolving either an
unopposed bounty or an opposed bounty
```
```
There are 3 types of encounters for the bounty hunter AI player,
which it resolves as follows:
```
```
Contact Tokens: The AI player can encounter facedown and
faceup contact tokens. When encountering a facedown contact
token, they flip that token faceup. If the contact matches one of
their bounties, they resolve an unopposed bounty. Otherwise,
the encounter ends.
Crew Cards: If there is a crew in the AI player’s space that
matches one of their bounties, they can encounter that crew. If
that crew belongs to another player, that player can choose to
protect their crew. If they choose to protect their crew, the AI
player resolves an opposed bounty. Otherwise, it resolves an
unopposed bounty.
Character Cards: If the AI player is in the same space as a
player whose character matches one of the AI player’s bounties,
they can encounter that character by resolving an opposed
bounty.
```
```
To resolve an unopposed bounty:
```
1. Remove the contact or crew being encountered from the
    game.
2. The AI player gains the elimination reward on the bounty
    card that matches the encountered contact or crew and
    resolves its After you gain a reward from this card text.
3. The AI player suffers damage on its character equal to the
    on the bounty card or on its ship equal to the on the
    bounty card.

```
To resolve an opposed bounty:
The AI player fights a combat against the player whose
character or crew matches the AI player’s bounty. If both
players are in a planet space, they fight a ground combat.
Otherwise, they fight a ship combat.
```
```
Follow the steps for combat as normal. The AI player is the
attacker and all of its abilities are ignored except those that add
to its combat value, health, or hull.
```
```
If the defender wins the combat, the AI player discards the
bounty card for the character or crew it had encountered.
```
```
If the AI player wins the combat, they resolve the following
according to the type of encounter:
```
```
Crew: The crew card is removed from the game. The AI player
gains the elimination reward on the bounty card matching that
crew and resolves its After you gain a reward from this card text.
```
```
Character: The AI player gains 5,000 and 1 fame regardless
of the reward on the bounty card.
Remove the bounty card from the game. Then, the AI player
gains or loses reputation as follows:
```
- If the defending player had negative reputation with one
    or more factions, the AI player gains 1 reputation with one of
    those factions of your choice, but you must choose a faction
    with which the AI player does not have positive reputation if
    possible.
- If the defending player had a positive reputation with one
    or more factions, the AI player loses 1 reputation with one of
    those factions of your choice.

### BOUNTY HUNTER AI CLARIFICATIONS

```
The AI player cannot buy the Wanted job card or the Information
Broker card from the bounty market deck. When instructed to
buy from the bounty market deck, the AI player discards any of
those cards if they are the top card of the bounty market deck.
```
```
When the AI player resolves a reveal contact icon after buying a
card, the AI player reveals a contact that matches the class of
one of its bounties, if able.
```
```
If an AI ability reveals a contact that matches a character in
play, discard that contact and repeat the effect that revealed
that contact, if able.
```
```
AI players cannot protect their crew.
```
```
When the AI player is instructed to discard the top card of the
market deck and gain credits, it is not buying that cargo
card, so the AI does not resolve any icons on the next card
revealed.
```
### USING MULTIPLE AI OPPONENTS

```
To play a single-player game with multiple AI opponents,
perform setup for both a bounty hunter character (starts with
databank card #90) and a non-bounty hunter character (starts
with databank card #91 or #92) and randomly determine a
turn order for those players (you still begin the game as the first
player). The first AI player in turn order starts the game with
6,000 and the other starts with 8,000.
To play the game, resolve each AI opponent’s turn separately,
drawing AI cards from the appropriate deck (the bounty hunter
AI deck for the bounty hunter character and the base game AI
deck for the other character). Keep track of each AI player’s
credits and assets separately. Both AI players are competing
with you and with each other to be the first to reach the target
fame number.
```
```
After each of your turns, draw and resolve 1 AI card from each
AI player’s deck in turn order. Then, play passes back to you.
```
### EXPANSION CLARIFICATIONS

```
Broken Arm,Encrypted Message,Priority Delivery, and
Structural Damage: When you gain one of these cards, if you
do not have an empty slot of the appropriate type, you must
discard another card to create an empty slot.
Cad Bane: When you gain 1 additional fame from an ability, Cad
Bane’s ability does not reduce that fame. If an ability reads you
have X additional fame, that fame is not affected by Cad’s ability.
If an effect reduces the rewards of a bounty, job, or cargo to
0, this does not affect the credits Cad gains from his ability.
```
```
Dengar: If Dengar has the IQA-11 Blaster Rifle gear card,
Dengar’s ability to reduce damage is applied first, and if the
damage taken is still greater than 2, the total is reduced to 2 by
the blaster rifle’s ability.
```
```
Empty contact spaces: Planets without an orange contact token
on them (including Core Worlds spaces) are empty contact
spaces for purposes of game effects that refer to such spaces.
```
```
Health remaining: A character’s health remaining is that
character’s health minus the number of damage on that
character.
Hondo Ohnaka: Goal tokens placed on Hondo’s assets remain
on those cards even if Hondo flips to the front side of his
character card.
```
```
Lando Calrissian: When resolving Lando’s encounter card, you
may reroll your die using the Lando crew’s ability. If you roll a
blank during this encounter and Lando is your only crew, you
must discard Lando.
```
```
Reputation: While a player is treated as having a reputation
different from their actual reputation, that player ignores any
reputation gained or lost with that faction.
```
