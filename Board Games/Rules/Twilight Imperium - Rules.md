## Quick Start Rules Guide
### Rules
#### Goal
Be the first to score 10 Victory Points (VP) by completing objectives and controlling the galaxy!

#### Setup:
1. Choose alien races: Each player selects a faction and takes all associated components.
2. Build galaxy: Use hexagonal system tiles to create the game board according to player count.
3. Place starting units: Put your initial ships and ground forces on your home system.
4. Distribute starting technologies, planet cards, and other faction-specific components.
5. Shuffle objective decks and reveal initial public objectives.

#### Game Round:
Each round consists of 4 phases:

1. Strategy Phase:
   - In player order, each person chooses a Strategy Card.
   - These cards determine turn order and provide special actions.

2. Action Phase:
   - Players take turns performing actions until everyone passes.
   - Main actions:
     a) Tactical Action: Activate a system to move ships, initiate combat, invade planets, or produce units.
     b) Strategic Action: Use your chosen Strategy Card's primary ability.
     c) Component Action: Use an action ability on one of your cards.

   Detailed breakdown of a Tactical Action:
   1. Activate a system by placing a Command Token from your tactic pool.
   2. Move ships into the activated system, obeying movement rules.
   3. Space Combat (if opposing ships present): Roll dice to attack, assign hits, repeat until one side is eliminated or retreats.
   4. Invasion (if planets present): Use Bombardment, commit ground forces, resolve Ground Combat.
   5. Production: Build new units using your Space Dock, limited by resources and production capacity.

3. Status Phase:
   - Score Objectives: Claim VP if you've met requirements of public or secret objectives.
   - Reveal new Public Objective
   - Draw Action Cards
   - Remove Command Tokens from the board
   - Gain and redistribute Command Tokens
   - Ready Cards (flip exhausted cards face-up)
   - Repair Units
   - Return Strategy Cards

4. Agenda Phase (triggered when Mecatol Rex is claimed):
   - Reveal and vote on two agendas that affect the game state
   - Use Influence from planets to cast votes

#### Key Concepts:

1. Command Tokens: Used to activate systems, increase fleet size, and perform strategic actions.

#### First Round Walkthrough:
1. Strategy Phase: Choose Strategy Cards in player order.
2. Action Phase: 
   - Typical first actions: Move ships to nearby systems, claim planets, build units.
   - Use your Strategy Card.
3. Status Phase: Likely no scoring yet, but gain new Command Tokens and ready cards.

# Twilight Imperium - Rules

## SETUP

A randomly chosen player is speaker and takes the speaker token.

Each player chooses a faction and takes their green-backed home
system tile; faction promissory note, 2 faction technology cards,
17 control tokens, 16 command tokens, and faction-specific
tokens. Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding
command sheet, plastic units, 25 technology cards, and 4
promissory notes. Combine your technology cards into one deck
and your promissory notes into one deck.

Each player takes the planet cards corresponding to the planets
in their home system and places them faceup in their play area.

Place the Mecatol Rex system tile in the center of the table; the
galaxy will consist of 3 rings around this tile, with each player’s
home systems in a set position in the third ring.

Separate the system tiles into a red-backed and blue-backed
piles. Shuffle each pile facedown, then deal the following number
of facedown system tiles to each player according to player count:

3 player: 6 blue and 2 red tiles. 5 player: 4 blue and 2 red tiles.

4 player: 5 blue and 3 red tiles. 6 player: 3 blue and 2 red tiles.

For a 5 player game, before placing system tiles, the speaker
draws 1 additional random red-backed system tile and places it
faceup in any space adjacent to Mecatol Rex.

Players place their home systems in the approximate positions
shown in the appropriate game setup diagram. Then, starting with
the speaker and going clockwise, each player places 1 system
tile faceup in the first ring around Mecatol Rex. After the last
player has placed their first tile, they place a second tile. Then,
the order of tile placement reverses and goes counterclockwise,
until it reaches the speaker again, who places 2 tiles. Then, tile
placement reverses again and proceeds clockwise. This process
repeats until players have placed all of their tiles.

Each ring around Mecatol Rex must be fully built before any tile
can be placed in the next ring. Anomaly system tiles cannot be
placed next to one another unless there is no other option. System
tiles that contain the same type of wormhole cannot be placed
next to one another unless there is no other option. After placing
all of the dealt system tiles, players attach their home systems.

In a 5 player game, 3 players receive trade goods based on their
positions (see the game setup diagram).

Place the custodians token on Mecatol Rex.

Shuffle the action card, agenda, stage I objective, stage II
objective, and secret objective decks separately.

Create separate piles for trade good tokens, fighter tokens, and
infantry tokens.

Place each of the 8 strategy cards faceup on the table within
reach of the speaker.

Each player takes the starting technologies and starting units
listed on the back of their faction sheet. Place your technology
cards faceup near your faction sheet and starting units in your
home system. Place 3 command tokens in your tactic pool, 3 in
your fleet pool, and 2 in your strategy pool.

Each player draws 2 secret objectives and chooses one to keep
(shuffle the other back into the deck without revealing it).

Place the victory point (VP) track near the board. As a group,
players decide whether to play with the 10 or 14 space side of the
VP track faceup. Each player places one of their control tokens on
the 0 space of the track.

```
The speaker deals 5 facedown stage I objectives and places them
in a row above the VP track. Then, the speaker deals 5 facedown
stage II objectives and places them in a row below the VP track.
```
```
The speaker then reveals the first 2 stage I objectives.
```
```
When you gain a command token, place it in either the tactic
pool, the fleet pool, or the strategy pool on your command sheet.
```
```
Units are ships, ground forces, or structures. Your own supply of
unused units and unused command tokens is your reinforcements.
```
```
Planets are cultural, hazardous, or industrial. To spend a planet’s
resources or influence, exhausts that planet’s planet card. You
can exhaust a planet that has more resources than you need, but
the excess resources are lost.
```
## GAME ROUND

## 1. STRATEGY PHASE

```
Starting with the speaker and in clockwise order, each player
chooses 1 strategy card (and any trade good tokens on it) from the
common area and places it faceup in their play area.
With 3-4 players, each player chooses a second card during a
second round of selection.
```
```
The speaker then places 1 trade goods token from the supply on
each unchosen strategy card.
```
## 2. ACTION PHASE

```
In the initiative order determined by the number on their strategy
cards (starting with the lowest number), players consecutively
take turns to perform a single action. If you have 2 cards, the
lowest number applies.
```
```
If you cannot or do not wish to take an action, you must pass and
your turn is skipped for the rest of the phase. You can still resolve
transactions, start-of-turn abilities, and the secondary abilities
of other players’ strategy cards. You cannot pass until you have
performed 1 strategic action. With 3-4 players, you cannot pass
until you have exhausted both your strategy cards.
```
```
Continue taking turns until all players have passed, then proceed
to the status phase.
```
## STRATEGIC ACTION

```
Read and resolve the primary ability on your strategy card.
```
```
Then the other players, in clockwise order from the active player,
may resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card. The active
player cannot resolve the secondary ability of their own card.
```
```
Once resolved, the active player exhausts their strategy card by
flipping it facedown.
```
## TACTICAL ACTION

###### 1. ACTIVATION

```
You must activate a system that does not contain one of your
command tokens (it may contain other players’ command tokens).
Place a command token from your tactic pool in that system; it
is now the active system for the rest of this tactical action. You
cannot activate a system if you have no command tokens in your
tactics pool.
```
2. MOVEMENT
You may move any number of ships from any number of systems
that do not contain one of your command tokens into the active
system.

```
Ships move through adjacent systems up to their MOVE value.
Systems are adjacent if any of their tile sides touch, or if they have
matching wormholes.
```
```
A ship must end its movement in the active system. A ship cannot
pass through a system that contains another player’s ships, and
you cannot move units out of a system that contains one of your
command tokens.
```
```
Ships that have CAPACITY can transport a number of ground
forces and fighters up that value. Your ships may also pick up
and transport ground forces and fighters from systems they pass
through that do not contain any of your command tokens.
```
```
The number of fighters and ground forces you have in the space
area of a system cannot exceed the combined CAPACITY of that
player’s ships in that system. Excess units are destroyed at the
end of combat.
```
```
Systems that contain identical wormholes are adjacent to one
another for all purposes.
```
```
A ship cannot move through or into an asteroid field or supernova.
```
```
A ship cannot move through, but may move into a nebula. A
defender’s ship in a nebula applies +1 to the result of each of its
combat rolls. A ship moving out of a nebula has a MOVE of 1.
A ship that moves through or out of a gravity rift applies +1 to its
MOVE and then rolls 1 die: on a 1-3, the ship is removed from the
board and returned to its reinforcements.
```
```
After movement is complete, all players can use the space cannon
abilities of their units in the active system.
```
3. SPACE COMBAT
If 2 players have ships in the active system, they must resolve space
combat. If you are the only one with ships there, skip this step.
4. INVASION
You may use your bombardment abilities, commit units to land on
planets, and resolve ground combat against other players’ units.
5. PRODUCTION
You may resolve the production ability of each of your units in the
active system to produce any of the units on your faction sheet, by
spending resources equal to those units’ total cost.
Take the newly produced unit from your reinforcements and place
it in the active system. Ships are placed in the space area and
ground forces are placed on the planet.
You cannot produce more units than the combined PRODUCTION
values of your units in the active system. If a unit’s cost is
accompanied by 2 icons, you receive 2 units for the indicated cost
(and each individual unit counts against the production limit).

```
If you have no units of the type you wish to produce, you may
remove one of your units of that type from a system that does
not contain one of your command tokens and return it to your
reinforcements.
```
```
If you produce a fighter or infantry unit, but have none in your
reinforcements, you can use fighter or infantry tokens from the
supply instead; these must be accompanied by at least 1 plastic
figure of that type that matches their color.
```
```
If your units with the production ability are in a system that
contains another player’s ships, your units are blockaded and
cannot produce ships. They may still produce ground forces.
```
```
If the blockaded player has captured any of the blockading
player’s units, those units are returned to the latter’s
reinforcements.
```
## COMPONENT ACTION

```
Resolve an action on a game component preceeded by the word
Action.
A component action cannot be performed if its ability cannot be
completely resolved. If a component action is canceled, it does
not use that player’s action.
```
## 3. STATUS PHASE

###### 1. SCORE OBJECTIVES

```
In initiative order, each player may score up to 1 public objective
and 1 secret objective if they fulfill its requirements.
```
2. REVEAL PUBLIC OBJECTIVE
The speaker flips an unrevealed public objective card faceup.
Stage II objectives cannot be revealed until all Stage I objectives
are revealed. The game ends if there are no unrevealed public
objectives at the start of this step.
3. DRAW ACTION CARDS
In initiative order, each player draws 1 action card.
4. REMOVE COMMAND TOKENS
Each player removes all of their command tokens from the board,
returning each token to their reinforcements.
5. GAIN AND REDISTRIBUTE COMMAND TOKENS
Each player gains 2 command tokens from their reinforcements.
Then, each player can redistribute all their command tokens
among their strategy, tactic, and fleet pools. Place command
tokens in your fleet pool with the ship silhouette faceup; the
number of tokens there is the maximum number of ships,
excluding fighters, that you can have in each system.
6. READY CARDS
Each player readies (turns faceup) all of their exhausted cards,
including strategy cards.
7. REPAIR UNITS
Each player repairs all of their units that have the sustain damage
ability by turning them upright.
8. RETURN STRATEGY CARDS
Each player returns their strategy card to the common area. Then,
if a player has removed the custodians token from Mecatol Rex,
the round continues to the agenda phase. Otherwise, a new game
round begins with the strategy phase.

## 4. AGENDA PHASE

```
After the custodians token is removed from Mecatol Rex, add the
agenda phase to each round.
```
1. FIRST AGENDA
1. REVEAL AGENDA: The speaker draws 1 agenda card from the
    top of the agenda deck and reads it aloud to all players.
2. VOTE: Each player, starting with the player to the left of the
    speaker and going clockwise, can cast votes for an outcome of
    the current agenda. You may choose to abstain. When it is your
    turn, you may exhaust any number of your planets: each planet
    contributes a number of votes equal to its INFLUENCE.
Announce the outcome you are voting for aloud. You can only
    vote on 1 outcome per agenda. Each player may negotiate up
    to 1 transaction with each other player while resolving the vote
    for each agenda.
FOR OR AGAINST: Vote FOR or AGAINST the agenda.
ELECT PLAYER: Vote for any player, including yourself.
ELECT PLANET: Vote for any planet; it must be controlled by a
    player unless the agenda specifies otherwise.
3. RESOLVE OUTCOME: Count votes and resolve the outcome that
    received the most votes.
When resolving a directive, resolve the outcome that received
    the most votes and discard the agenda card immediately.
When resolving a law, if a FOR outcome received the most
    votes, or if the law requires an election, the law’s effect
    becomes a permanent part of the game.


Resolve the outcome and place the agenda card in the common
play area unless the effect specifies otherwise. If an AGAINST
outcome received the most votes, resolve the text effect of the
outcome and discard the agenda immediately.

If multiple outcomes receive the same number of votes, the
speaker decides which of the tied outcomes is resolved.

2. SECOND AGENDA
Repeat the first agenda step for a second agenda.
3. READY PLANETS

Each player readies each of their exhausted planet cards. Then, a
new game round begins starting with the strategy phase.

## TACTICAL ACTION: SPACE COMBAT

During combat, the active player is the attacker and the other
player is the defender.

1. ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE
Each player’s units can use their anti-fighter barrage abilities.
2. ANNOUNCE RETREAT

Either player may choose to announce a retreat. The units will
retreat at the end of the combat round.

3. MAKE COMBAT ROLLS
Each player rolls 1 die for each ship they have in the active
system. For each result equal to or higher than the COMBAT of
that unit, a hit is scored.

If a unit’s COMBAT contains 2 or more burst icons, the player rolls
that number of dice instead.

4. ASSIGN HITS
Each player must choose and destroy 1 of their ships for each hit
their opponent produced. Remove destroyed ships from the board
and places them in your reinforcements.
5. RETREAT
If a player announced a retreat during the first step of the combat
round, they retreat. The player takes all of their ships from the
combat and places them in an adjacent system. This system
cannot contain ships that belong to another player and must
contain either a planet the retreating player controls or at least
one of their units; otherwise, the player cannot retreat.

If the system does not contain one of that player’s command
tokens, the player must place 1 token from their reinforcements in
that system when they retreat.

END OF SPACE COMBAT
If both players have units remaining in the combat at the end of
the retreat step, resolve another round of combat starting with the
announce retreat step.

After all units on one or both sides of the combat have been
destroyed or have retreated, play proceeds to the invasion step.

A player has won a space combat if they are the only player with
ships remaining in the active system when the combat has ended.

## TACTICAL ACTION: INVASION

###### 1. BOMBARDMENT

If any planets in the active system contain another player’s ground
forces, the active player may use the bombardment abilities of
any of their units in that system.

2. COMMIT GROUND FORCES
The active player decides which ground forces they wish to land
on planets. Take any of your ground forces that are with your ships
in the space area of the active system and place them on the
planet you wish to invade.

###### 3. SPACE CANNON DEFENSE

```
If another player has a PDS on any of the planets the active player
has committed ground forces to, that player may be able to use
its space cannon ability to destroy some of those forces before
they land.
```
4. GROUND COMBAT
If multiple players have ground forces on the same planet, they
resolve a ground combat. Combats on multiple planets are
resolved in the order of the active player’s choice.
Each round of ground combat consist of 2 steps, following the
same rules as the space combat steps of the same name:
1. Make combat rolls: Each player rolls 1 die for each ground
    force they have on the planet.
2. Assign hits: Each player in the combat must choose and
    destroy 1 of their own ground forces for each hit their opponent
    produced.

```
After assigning hits, if multiple players have units remaining on
the planet, resolve another round of ground combat starting with
the make combat rolls step. After all units on one or both sides of
the combat have been destroyed, proceed to the next step.
```
5. ESTABLISH CONTROL
The active player gains control of each invaded planet that
still contains at least one of their ground forces. Take its
corresponding planet card and place it in your play area
exhausted. If the planet contains structures that belong to another
player, those structures are destroyed.

## ACTION CARDS

```
Each player may have a maximum of 7 action cards in hand; if
you ever have more, you must choose and discard cards down to
this limit. Action cards should be kept hidden from other players.
Multiple action cards with the same name cannot be played
during a single timing window to affect the same units or effect.
```
```
A canceled action card has no effect and is discarded.
```
## TRADE GOODS & COMMODITIES

```
Trade goods are a universal currency used to produce
units or bribe other empires. You may spend a trade
good as either 1 resource or 1 influence.
Commodities are products that are plentiful within your
empire. They become trade goods when given to another
player.
```
```
Players may replenish commodities by using the abilities of the
Trade strategy card. Take commodity tokens from the supply until
you have a number of tokens equal to the COMMODITIES value on
your faction sheet. You cannot have more commodities than that
printed value.
Both trade goods and commodities are represented by opposite
sides of the same token. When you give another player a
commodity, that player flips the token to its trade good side.
```
## TRANSACTIONS & DEALS

```
If a player has a unit, or controls a planet, in a system that is
adjacent to a system that contains a unit or planet that another
player controls, those players are neighbors.
```
```
During your turn, you may negotiate a transaction with one or
more neighbors, even during a combat. The negotiating players
may exchange any number of trade goods and commodities.
The active player may negotiate only once with each of their
neighbors per turn. After a transaction has been finalized, no
other transactions may occur between those players that turn.
```
```
Transactions that go beyond a simple exchange of goods are
called deals. An effect that can be resolved immediately is a
binding deal: a player must honor their end of the bargain. An
effect that cannot be resolved immediately is a non-binding deal:
a player is not required to honor their end of the bargain and may
fulfill or ignore the deal as they choose.
```
```
A player can offer a promissory note to another player as part of
a transaction. You may allow the receiving player to view the card
being offered if you wish. You cannot resolve your own promissory
notes, but you can resolve other players’ notes you receive from
a transaction.
```
```
You cannot trade more than 1 promissory note during a single
transaction.
```
```
When you resolve a promissory note, reveal the card and resolve
its text effect. They are usually returned to their original owner and
may again be offered by that player as part of a transaction.
```
```
You can also exchange promissory notes you have received from
other players (no permission from the original owner is required).
```
## TECHNOLOGY

```
Each player has a deck of technology cards they may look through
at any time, as well as a number of faction technology cards.
Place your starting technologies and any technology you research
faceup in your play area.
```
```
A technology’s color is either green (biotic), red (warfare), blue
(propulsion), or yellow (cybernetic). When a technology is faceup
in your play area, you own that technology: it remains in play for
the rest of the game and you can use its abilities.
```
```
When you gain a unit upgrades technology, place its card over the
corresponding unit on your faction sheet. White arrows next to an
attribute’s value indicate that the attribute will improve when its
unit is upgraded. When a unit is upgraded, all the player’s units
of that type, both on the board and in their reinforcements, now
have the attributes shown on the unit upgrade technology.
```
```
RESEARCHING TECHNOLOGY
Players gain new technology by researching it, usually by using
the Technology strategy card. You must satisfy the prerequisites
of the technology you wish to research. Prerequisites are on the
lower-left side of each technology card and contain one or more
symbols that correspond to the 4 technology colors.
To satisfy a technology’s prerequisites, a player must own a
matching technology for each prerequisite symbol on the card
that they wish to research.
```
```
If you control a planet that has a technology specialty symbol, you
may exhaust that planet when researching technology to ignore a
prerequisite that matches that technology specialty.
```
```
While researching technology, you may exhaust planets for their
technology specialty or for their resources, but not for both.
```
## UNIT ABILITIES

###### PLANETARY SHIELD

```
The planet where this unit is located is not an eligible target for
other units’ bombardment abilities.
```
```
SUSTAIN DAMAGE
This unit can become damaged to cancel 1 hit. A damaged unit
is turned on its side but otherwise functions normally. A damaged
unit cannot use this ability until it is repaired during the status
phase or by another effect.
```
```
PRODUCTION
This unit can produce new units. Its PRODUCTION value is the
maximum number of units it can produce.
```
###### OFFENSIVE ABILITIES

```
Offensive abilities require you to roll dice to determine whether or
not another player’s units are hit, and are followed by a number
that determines the minimum die result required to produce a hit.
```
```
Hits produced by abilities are assigned immediately. When a hit
is produced against a player’s units, that player chooses and
destroys one of their units.
ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE: A player uses this ability during the anti-
fighter barrage step of the first round of space combat. These hits
can only be assigned to fighters.
```
```
BOMBARDMENT: A player uses this ability during the
bombardment step of an invasion. These hits can only be
assigned by the bombarded player to ground forces on the planet
being bombarded. If there are multiple planets in the system, the
active player must choose which of their units in the system are
bombarding which planets before rolling dice.
```
```
SPACE CANNON: You can use this ability at these times:
```
- After the movement step of a tactical action, all players can
    use the space cannon abilities of their units that are in the
    active system. The player whose units the ability was used
    against must assign these hits to ships in that system.
- During the space cannon defense step of an invasion, the
    player who controls the planet being invaded can use the
    space cannon abilities of their units on that planet. The
    invading player must assign these hits to their ground forces
    that are invading the planet.

## THE GALACTIC COUNCIL

```
Players may freely move units into the Mecatol Rex system, but
cannot land ground forces on the planet while the custodians
token is present.
```
```
To remove this token, the active player must spend 6 influence
immediately before landing ground forces on the planet. They
cannot land ground forces if they cannot spend the influence.
If you remove the custodians token, place it in your play area and
gain 1 VP. From now on the agenda phase is added as the last
phase of each game round (including this round).
```
## WINNING THE GAME

```
The first player to gain 10 VPs wins the game (or 14 VPs if
players are using the 14 space side of the victory track).
```
```
You gain VPs by completing objectives. Each objective specifies
when a player can score it. Each player can only score 1 public
and 1 secret objective during each status phase and each step of
the action phase.
```
```
Gain the number of VPs on the card by advancing your VP token
on the VP track, then place a control token from your supply on
the card to show that you have scored it and cannot score it again.
Place a scored secret objective faceup in front of you before
placing a control token on it.
```
```
You cannot score a public objective if you do not control all the
planets in your home system.
```
```
You cannot have more than 3 total scored and unscored secret
objectives. If you draw a secret objective and have more than 3,
return 1 unscored secret objective to the deck and shuffle it.
```
```
If an ability refers to the player with the most or fewest VPs, and
there is a tie, the effect applies to all of the tied players.
```
```
Imperium Rex: When the speaker would reveal an objective but
cannot, the game immediately ends and the player with the most
VPs wins the game. On a tie, the player among the tied players
who is earliest in initiative order wins the game.
```

## GAME ROUND

## 1. STRATEGY PHASE

Starting with the speaker and in clockwise order, each player
chooses 1 strategy card (and any trade good tokens on it).

3-4 players: each player chooses a second card during a second
round of selection.

The speaker then places 1 trade goods token from the supply
on each unchosen strategy card.

## 2. ACTION PHASE

In the initiative order determined by the number on their
strategy cards (starting with the lowest), players consecutively
take turns to perform a single action.

If you cannot or do not wish to take an action, you must
pass. You can still resolve transactions, start-of-turn abilities,
and the secondary abilities of other players’ strategy cards. You
cannot pass until you have performed 1 strategic action.

3-4 players: you cannot pass until you have exhausted both your
strategy cards.

## STRATEGIC ACTION

Read and resolve the primary ability on your strategy card.

Then the other players, in clockwise order, may resolve the
secondary ability of that strategy card. Once resolved, the active
player exhausts their strategy card by flipping it.

## TACTICAL ACTION

###### 1. ACTIVATION

You must activate a system that does not contain one of your
command tokens. Place a command token from your tactic pool
in that system; it is now the active system for the rest of this
tactical action.

2. MOVEMENT
You may move any number of ships from any number of systems
that do not contain one of your command tokens into the active
system, through adjacent systems up to their MOVE.

A ship cannot pass through a system that contains another
player’s ships, and you cannot move units out of a system that
contains one of your command tokens.

Ships that have CAPACITY can transport a number of ground
forces and fighters up that value. Your ships may also pick up
and transport ground forces and fighters from systems they
pass through that do not contain any of your command tokens.

The number of fighters and ground forces you have in a
system’s space area cannot exceed the combined CAPACITY of
that player’s ships in that system. Excess units are destroyed at
the end of combat.

Systems with identical wormholes are adjacent to one another.
A ship cannot move through or into an asteroid field or
supernova. A ship cannot move through, but may move into a
nebula. A defender’s ship in a nebula applies +1 to the result
of each of its combat rolls. A ship moving out of a nebula has
a MOVE of 1. A ship that moves through or out of a gravity rift
applies +1 to its MOVE and then rolls 1 die: 1-3, the ship is
removed from the board and returned to its reinforcements.

After movement is complete, all players can use the space
cannon abilities of their units in the active system.

###### 3. SPACE COMBAT

```
If 2 players have ships in the active system, resolve space combat.
```
4. INVASION
You may use bombardment abilities, commit units to land on
planets, and resolve ground combat against other players’ units.
5. PRODUCTION
You may resolve the production ability of each of your units in
the active system to produce any of the units on your faction
sheet, by spending resources equal to those units’ total cost.
You cannot produce more units than the combined
PRODUCTION values of your units in the active system.
If your units are in a system with another player’s ships, yours
are blockaded and cannot produce ships.

## COMPONENT ACTION

```
Resolve an action on a component preceeded by ‘Action’.
```
## 3. STATUS PHASE

###### 1. SCORE OBJECTIVES

```
In initiative order, each player may score up to 1 public
objective and 1 secret objective if they fulfill its requirements.
```
2. REVEAL PUBLIC OBJECTIVE
The game ends if there are no unrevealed public objectives.
The speaker flips an unrevealed public objective card faceup.
3. DRAW ACTION CARDS
In initiative order, each player draws 1 action card.
4. REMOVE COMMAND TOKENS
Players remove all of their command tokens from the board.
5. GAIN AND REDISTRIBUTE COMMAND TOKENS
Each player gains 2 command tokens from their reinforcements.
Then each player can redistribute all their command tokens.
6. READY CARDS
Each player readies (turns faceup) all of their exhausted cards.
7. REPAIR UNITS
Each player turns upright all of their units that have the sustain
damage ability by turning them upright.
8. RETURN STRATEGY CARDS
Each player returns their strategy card to the common area.

## 4. AGENDA PHASE

```
After the custodians token is removed from Mecatol Rex, add
the agenda phase to each round.
```
1. FIRST AGENDA
1. REVEAL AGENDA: The speaker draws 1 agenda card from the
    top of the agenda deck and reads it aloud to all players.
2. VOTE: Each player, starting with the player to the left of the
    speaker and going clockwise, can cast votes for an outcome.
    You may abstain. When it is your turn, exhaust any number of
    your planets: each contributes votes equal to its INFLUENCE.
    Each player may negotiate up to 1 transaction with each
    other player while resolving the vote for each agenda.
3. RESOLVE OUTCOME: Count votes and resolve the outcome
    that received the most votes.
2. SECOND AGENDA
Repeat the first agenda step for a second agenda.
3. READY PLANETS

Starting with the speaker and in clockwise order, each player
chooses 1 strategy card (and any trade good tokens on it).
```
```
3-4 players: each player chooses a second card during a second
round of selection.
```
```
The speaker then places 1 trade goods token from the supply
on each unchosen strategy card.
```
## 2. ACTION PHASE

```
In the initiative order determined by the number on their
strategy cards (starting with the lowest), players consecutively

## UNIT ABILITIES

## ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE

This unit may be able to destroy an opponent’s fighters at the
start of a space battle. During the anti-fighter barrage step of
the first round of space combat, perform these steps:

1. Each player makes an anti-fighter barrage roll for each
    of their units in the combat with this ability. One hit is
    produced for each result that equals or exceeds the unit’s
    ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE value (X is the minimum needed to
    hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled).

Game effects that affect combat rolls do not affect anti-
fighter barrage rolls. This ability can still be used if no
fighters are present; hits may trigger specific abilities.

2. Each player must choose and destroy 1 of their fighters in
    the active system for each hit. Excess hits have no effect.

## BOMBARDMENT

This unit may be able to destroy another player’s ground forces
during an invasion. During the bombardment step, perform
these steps:

1. The active player chooses which planet each of their
    units with this ability will bombard. They then make a
    bombardment roll for each of them. One hit is produced
    for each result that equals or exceeds the unit’s
    BOMBARDMENT value (X is the minimum needed to hit, and
    Y is the number of dice rolled; if there is no Y, roll 1 die).

Game effects that affect combat rolls do not affect
bombardment rolls. You may bombard multiple planets in
a system, but declare which planet a unit is bombarding
before making a bombardment roll.

Planets that contain a unit with the planetary shield ability
cannot be bombarded. The L1Z1X’s harrow ability does not
affect the L1Z1X player’s own ground forces.

2. The player who controls the planet that is being bombarded
    chooses and destroys one of their ground forces on that
    planet for each hit. Excess hits have no effect.

## PLANETARY SHIELD

Units cannot use the bombardment ability against a planet
that contains a unit with planetary shield ability.

This ability does not prevent a planet from being affected by
the X-89 bacterial weapon technology. It does prevent an
L1Z1X player from using their harrow ability.

If a war sun is in a system with any number of other players’
units with this ability, those units are treated as if they do not
have this ability. Such units cannot use the magen defense grid
technology. A war sun can use its bombardment ability against
planets that contain units with the planetary shield ability.

## PRODUCTION

During the production step of a tactical action, you can resolve
the production ability of each of your units that are in the
active system to produce units.

A unit’s PRODUCTION value is the maximum number of units
the unit can produce. If you have multiple producing units in
the system, you can produce a number of unit’s up to their
combined total PRODUCTION.

```
When producing fighters or infantry, each individual unit
counts toward the producing unit’s production limit. You can
produce 1 fighter or infantry instead of 2, but must still pay the
entire cost.
```
## SPACE CANNON

```
During a tactical action, at the end of the movement step and
beginning with the active player and proceeding clockwise,
each player may use the space cannon ability of each of their
units in the active system.
This ability can be used even if no ships were moved during the
move ships step.
```
1. Make a space cannon roll for each of your units in the active
    system with the space cannon ability. One hit is produced
    for each result that equals or exceeds the unit’s SPACE
    CANNON value (X is the minimum needed to hit, and Y is
    the number of dice rolled; if there is no Y, roll 1 die).

```
If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can
use the space cannon ability of their PDS units that are
in systems adjacent to the active system. Hits are still
assigned to units in the active system.
```
```
Game effects that affect combat rolls do not affect space
cannon rolls.
```
2. If the active player was firing, they choose a player who has
    ships in the active system. Players other than the active
    player must target the active player’s units.

```
The targeted player must choose and destroy one of their
ships in the active system for each hit.
```
#### SPACE CANNON DEFENSE

```
During the invasion step of a tactical action, after ground
forces have been committed to land on planets, players other
than the active player can resolve the space cannon ability of
their units on those planets.
```
1. Each player makes a space cannon roll for each of their
    units on the invaded planet with the space cannon ability.
    One hit is produced for each result that equals or exceeds
    the unit’s SPACE CANNON value (X is the minimum needed
    to hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled; if there is no Y, roll
    1 die).
Game effects that affect combat rolls do not affect space
    cannon rolls. Game effects that allow the use of space
    cannon abilities against ships in adjacent systems have no
    effect during space cannon defense.
2. The active player must choose and destroy one of their
    ground forces on the planet for each hit. Hits can only be
    assigned to units that are on the same planet as the units
    using this ability.

## SUSTAIN DAMAGE

```
Immediately before a player assigns hits to their units from any
source, they can use the sustain damage ability of any of their
units in the active system.
```
```
For each such ability that you use, 1 hit produced by another
player’s units is canceled. Then, each unit using this ability is
placed on its side to indicate that it is damaged.
```
```
A damaged unit functions the same as an undamaged unit,
except it cannot use the sustain damage ability until it is
repaired during the status phase or by another effect.
```
```
A unit can only use this ability if it is eligible to be hit, and this
ability cannot be used to cancel an effect that directly destroys
a unit.
```
## UNIT ABILITIES

## ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE

```
This unit may be able to destroy an opponent’s fighters at the
start of a space battle. During the anti-fighter barrage step of
the first round of space combat, perform these steps:
```
1. Each player makes an anti-fighter barrage roll for each
    of their units in the combat with this ability. One hit is
    produced for each result that equals or exceeds the unit’s
    ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE value (X is the minimum needed to
    hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled).
Game effects that affect combat rolls do not affect anti-
    fighter barrage rolls. This ability can still be used if no
    fighters are present; hits may trigger specific abilities.
2. Each player must choose and destroy 1 of their fighters in
    the active system for each hit. Excess hits have no effect.

## BOMBARDMENT

```
This unit may be able to destroy another player’s ground forces
during an invasion. During the bombardment step, perform
these steps:
```
1. The active player chooses which planet each of their
    units with this ability will bombard. They then make a
    bombardment roll for each of them. One hit is produced
    for each result that equals or exceeds the unit’s
    BOMBARDMENT value (X is the minimum needed to hit, and
    Y is the number of dice rolled; if there is no Y, roll 1 die).
Game effects that affect combat rolls do not affect
    bombardment rolls. You may bombard multiple planets in
    a system, but declare which planet a unit is bombarding
    before making a bombardment roll.

```
Planets that contain a unit with the planetary shield ability
cannot be bombarded. The L1Z1X’s harrow ability does not
affect the L1Z1X player’s own ground forces.
```
2. The player who controls the planet that is being bombarded
    chooses and destroys one of their ground forces on that
    planet for each hit. Excess hits have no effect.

## PLANETARY SHIELD

```
Units cannot use the bombardment ability against a planet
that contains a unit with planetary shield ability.
```
```
This ability does not prevent a planet from being affected by
the X-89 bacterial weapon technology. It does prevent an
L1Z1X player from using their harrow ability.
```
```
If a war sun is in a system with any number of other players’
units with this ability, those units are treated as if they do not
have this ability. Such units cannot use the magen defense grid
technology. A war sun can use its bombardment ability against
planets that contain units with the planetary shield ability.
```
## PRODUCTION

```
During the production step of a tactical action, you can resolve
the production ability of each of your units that are in the
active system to produce units.
```
```
A unit’s PRODUCTION value is the maximum number of units
the unit can produce. If you have multiple producing units in
the system, you can produce a number of unit’s up to their
combined total PRODUCTION.
```
```
When producing fighters or infantry, each individual unit
counts toward the producing unit’s production limit. You can
produce 1 fighter or infantry instead of 2, but must still pay the
entire cost.
```
## SPACE CANNON

```
During a tactical action, at the end of the movement step and
beginning with the active player and proceeding clockwise,
each player may use the space cannon ability of each of their
units in the active system.
This ability can be used even if no ships were moved during the
move ships step.
```
1. Make a space cannon roll for each of your units in the active
    system with the space cannon ability. One hit is produced
    for each result that equals or exceeds the unit’s SPACE
    CANNON value (X is the minimum needed to hit, and Y is
    the number of dice rolled; if there is no Y, roll 1 die).

```
If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can
use the space cannon ability of their PDS units that are
in systems adjacent to the active system. Hits are still
assigned to units in the active system.
```
```
Game effects that affect combat rolls do not affect space
cannon rolls.
```
2. If the active player was firing, they choose a player who has
    ships in the active system. Players other than the active
    player must target the active player’s units.

```
The targeted player must choose and destroy one of their
ships in the active system for each hit.
```
#### SPACE CANNON DEFENSE

```
During the invasion step of a tactical action, after ground
forces have been committed to land on planets, players other
than the active player can resolve the space cannon ability of
their units on those planets.
```
1. Each player makes a space cannon roll for each of their
    units on the invaded planet with the space cannon ability.
    One hit is produced for each result that equals or exceeds
    the unit’s SPACE CANNON value (X is the minimum needed
    to hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled; if there is no Y, roll
    1 die).
Game effects that affect combat rolls do not affect space
    cannon rolls. Game effects that allow the use of space
    cannon abilities against ships in adjacent systems have no
    effect during space cannon defense.
2. The active player must choose and destroy one of their
    ground forces on the planet for each hit. Hits can only be
    assigned to units that are on the same planet as the units
    using this ability.

## SUSTAIN DAMAGE

```
Immediately before a player assigns hits to their units from any
source, they can use the sustain damage ability of any of their
units in the active system.
```
```
For each such ability that you use, 1 hit produced by another
player’s units is canceled. Then, each unit using this ability is
placed on its side to indicate that it is damaged.
```
```
A damaged unit functions the same as an undamaged unit,
except it cannot use the sustain damage ability until it is
repaired during the status phase or by another effect.
```
```
A unit can only use this ability if it is eligible to be hit, and this
ability cannot be used to cancel an effect that directly destroys
a unit.
```

## PROPHECY OF KINGS

## SETUP

VPs are easier to score when using this expansion: if you wish to
play a longer game, use the 14 VP side of the victory track.

Remove these agenda cards from the base game: Core
Mining, Demilitarized Zone, Holy Planet of Ixth, Representative
Government, Research Team: Biotic, Research Team: Cybernetic,
Research Team: Propulsion, Research Team: Warfare, Senate
Sanctuary, Shard of the Throne, Terraforming Initiative, The Crown
of Emphidia, The Crown of Thalnos.

Add the 4 mech units, 8 new technology cards, and 1 new
promissory note that match each base-game color to the other
components of that type.

Add the remaining cards to their respective decks, and shuffle
the red-backed and blue-backed system tiles into their respective
piles of base-game system tiles.

Replace the Diplomacy and Construction strategy cards from the
base game with their revised versions.

Add the 7 new faction sheets to the stack of sheets from the base
game.

In addition to their faction components from the base game, each
player takes their faction’s mech unit card and their 3 leader
cards.

These factions take additional components:

The Ghosts of Creuss: 1 creuss gamma wormhole token.
The Vuil’raith Cabal: 3 dimensional tear tokens.
The Nekro Virus: 3 dimensional tear tokens.
The Titans of Ul: 5 Ul sleeper tokens.
The Embers of Muaat: 1 Muaat supernova tile.

Each faction’s components now include 4 mech units, 8 new
technology cards, 1 new promissory note, and 1 leader sheet.

Each player slides the edge of their leader sheet under their
faction sheet. Then, from top to bottom slot, they place their
agent, commander, and hero leader cards and their mech unit
card on the leader sheet. All leaders are placed showing the side
that has the slot icon in the upper-right corner.

When creating the game board, place the wormhole nexus in the
common area so the side that shows only the gamma wormhole
is faceup. Then, place the 3 gamma wormhole tokens next to the
wormhole nexus.

If playing with 5, 7, or 8 players, see the rulebook for specifics
about creating the game board for that number of players. See
also the customizable game board setup options.

Place 1 frontier token on each non-home system that has no
planets. Return the remaining frontier tokens to the box. Place all
attachment tokens near the board.

Shuffle the relic deck and each exploration deck separately and
place them in the common area.

If an ability instructs you to purge a component, remove it from
the game and return it to the box. If a planet card is purged, also
purge all cards attached to that planet card and remove the
corresponding attachment tokens from the board.

## LEADERS

```
Each faction has 3 leaders with unique abilities. There are 3 types
of leaders:
AGENT: Each agent ability exhausts that leader. Agents are
readied along with all other exhausted cards during the ready
cards step.
```
```
COMMANDER: Each commander has a passive ability. This
ability can be shared with another faction by trading the Alliance
promissory card.
```
```
HERO: Each hero has a very powerful, once per game ability.
```
```
Agent abilities are available from the beginning of the game, but
commander and hero abilities begin the game locked. When the
goal on a leader card is fulfilled, flip the card: the ability side is
now unlocked and available for use.
```
## MECH UNITS

```
Mechs are specialized ground forces produced like other units
and available from the beginning of the game. They can be
transported and can participate in ground combat.
```
```
Deploy abilities provide an alternative way to place units on the
board. These abilities can only be resolved to place a unit that is in
a player’s reinforcements, and each deploy ability can be resolved
only once per timing window.
```
## CAPTURE

```
Some abilities instruct you to capture a unit. While a unit is
captured, it is placed on the capturing player’s faction sheet until
it is returned.
```
```
If at least one of a player’s units with the production ability is
being blockaded, they cannot capture units from the player who
is blockading them.
```
```
NON-FIGHTER SHIPS AND MECHS
If a player captures a non-fighter ship or mech, they place it on
their faction sheet. When such a unit is returned, it is placed in the
reinforcements of the player who it was captured from. A captured
non-fighter ship or mech can be returned:
```
- If the player who captured the unit agrees to return it as part of
    a transaction.
- If an ability allows a player to return a captured ship, typically
    as a cost for an effect.
- If the player whose unit was captured blockades a space dock
    of the player who captured the unit.

```
FIGHTERS AND GROUND FORCES
If a player captures a fighter or ground force, it is placed in its
reinforcements instead of on the capturing player’s faction sheet.
```
```
Then, the capturing player places a fighter or ground force token
from the supply on their faction sheet instead. Captured fighters
and ground forces do not belong to any player color, so they
cannot be returned as part of a transaction and they are not
returned because of a blockade. They remain on the capturing
player’s faction sheet until an ability returns them, when they are
placed in the supply.
```
## LEGENDARY PLANETS

```
When you take control of a legendary planet, place its legendary
planet ability card in your play area. Each has a unique ability that
can be used at the end of your turn.
```
```
If a player gains control of an exhausted legendary planet ability
card, it remains exhausted.
```
## EXPLORATION

```
When you take control of a planet that is not already controlled
by another player, you explore that planet. Draw a card from
the top of the exploration deck that matches that planet’s type
and resolve the effect. Then discard the card, unless it is a relic
fragment or has an attach ability.
Planets that do not have a type cannot be explored.
```
```
Players with the Dark Energy Tap technology can explore
frontier tokens. Discard the token and draw a card from
the top of the frontier exploration deck.
```
```
If you gain control of multiple planets at the same time, choose the
order in which you explore those planets, drawing and resolving
each planet’s exploration card before exploring the next planet.
```
```
ATTACHED CARDS
When you draw an exploration card that includes the attach
header, attach it to the explored planet’s card by sliding it
underneath. Then, place the matching attachment token on that
planet on the board. That planet is modified by the exploration
card’s values and ability, and the attached card remains attached
if another player takes control of that planet.
```
```
RELIC FRAGMENTS AND RELICS
When you draw an exploration card that contains relic fragment
in the title, place it faceup in your play area. 3 relic fragments of
the same type can be purged to gain a relic: draw a card from the
top of the relic deck and place it faceup in your play area. Relic
fragments can be exchanged as part of a transaction.
```
## WORMHOLE NEXUS & HYPERLANES

```
The wormhole nexus is a region of the galaxy where several
wormholes converge. The tile’s inactive side displays a gamma
wormhole, and the active side displays 3 wormholes. The nexus is
treated as part of the board, and it begins the game inactive (so it
is only adjacent to tiles that have a gamma wormhole).
```
```
The first time a player moves or places a unit into the wormhole
nexus or gains control of its planet (Mallice), the nexus becomes
active: flip it to its active side. The active nexus is adjacent to tiles
that have an alpha, beta, or gamma wormhole.
When playing with 5 or 7 players, the galaxy is set up with
hyperlane tiles. Each contiguous line created by one or more
hyperlane tiles is a hyperlane. System tiles connected by a
hyperlane are adjacent for all purposes.
```
```
Hyperlane tiles improve balance in the starting positions for each
player, so players do not receive extra trade goods for having a
particular starting position.
```
```
Hyperlane tiles are not systems. They cannot have units on them
and they cannot be targets for effects or abilities.
```

Victory
Game ends when a player reaches 10VP.
