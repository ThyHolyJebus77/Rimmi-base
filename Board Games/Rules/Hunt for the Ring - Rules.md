# Hunt for the Ring - Rules
## PART 1: THREE IS COMPANY

One player is the Ring-bearer player. The other player or players
are the Ringwraith players, and control the Nazgûl. Ringwraith
players should divide the Nazgûl between them.

**ADJACENT**

Any 2 spaces on the board (dots or locations) are adjacent if
they are directly joined by a path or road, and thus within 1
space of movement from each other.

**CONNECTED**
Any 2 spaces on the board (dots or locations) are connected if
they are adjacent to one another or are separated only by dots.
A location is also connected to itself.

**WITHIN REACH**
A location is within reach if it is adjacent to Frodo’s last location,
or, if it is connected to Frodo’s last location by a number of dots
equal to, or less than, the number of dots marked on the journey
log after the last location.

## SETUP

Set aside these components: the Part 2 corruption tiles (grey);
the 2 decks of journey cards; the deck of Part 2 ally cards
(orange back); Gandalf’s reference card, figure, and deed
tokens; the Lord of the Nazgûl’s reference card, figure, and
action die; and Strider’s company card. Use the Part 1 side of
the board.

Ring-bearer player
Place the Ring-bearer’s screen in front of you with the Part 1
board image vertical. Fold a blank sheet of paper to size, insert it
into the journey log, and place that at the bottom of the screen,
Part 1 side faceup.

Place 3 fellowship tokens on the large dark green space on the
journey log to form the fellowship pool.

```
Randomly draw 1 Frodo’s starting location token
and secretly look at it (return the rest to the box).
Place it on Frodo’s portrait on the journey log.
```
Place the company cards Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee
and Peregrin Took in front of you, ability faceup. Set aside the
Meriadoc Brandybuck card.

Shuffle the ally cards for Part 1 (green back), then draw 3 cards
to form your starting hand.

Place the turn marker on the leftmost daylight box on the turn
track, ring side facing up. Place the corruption marker on the
0 space of the corruption track. Place the Frodo figure on the 0
space of the movement track.

Randomly draw 5 information tokens and secretly look at
them. Choose 1 token and give it to the Ringwraiths. Keep the
remaining 4 tokens behind your screen, on the spaces on the
light green background on the journey log. Return the remaining
tokens unseen to the box.

Ringwraith player(s)

Divide the Nazgûl figures and the corresponding Ringwraith
cards among the Ringwraith players. Those controlling 2 or
more Nazgûl must arrange their cards in the order they want
them to act during the game.

Place the Black Riders reference card in view of all players, with
the information token received from the Ring-bearer player on
the card, unlocking the first ability.

```
Place the Ringwraith log tokens close to all Ringwraith players.
```
```
Shuffle the sorcery cards. Each Ringwraith player draws 1 card
to form his starting hand (only 1 card per player, regardless
of the number of Nazgûl controlled). During the game, each
Ringwraith player holds a separate hand of sorcery cards.
```
```
Place the standard beige Part 1 corruption tiles in an opaque
container or a stack to form the hunt pool. Keep the 2 red
special corruption tiles separate.
```
```
Give the lead player token to 1 Ringwraith player chosen at
random. Starting with the lead player, all Ringwraith players
place their Nazgûl figures on the board, each on a different
Nazgûl starting location.
The lead player takes the 6 Ringwraith action dice (the action
dice pool) and rolls them. The Ring-bearer player takes 1
fellowship token from the fellowship pool for each shadow result
rolled, and places the token(s) on Frodo’s company card.
```
## GAME DAYS

```
The game is divided into days, each of which represents 1 day of
travel and is divided into 3 turns tracked by the turn marker: 2
daylight turns and 1 nightfall turn. At the end of each day there
is a Refresh step, then a new day begins.
```
```
During each turn, the Ring-bearer player goes first. Then,
the Ringwraith players take their turns in order, starting with
the lead player and going clockwise around the table. Those
controlling more than 1 Nazgûl take a turn for every Nazgûl
under their control, in the order chosen at setup.
Multiple Ringwraith players may talk and cooperate, but they
cannot show their cards or exchange secret information.
```
## DAY SEQUENCE (PART 1)

###### DAYLIGHT TURN 1

```
[Frodo’s Company card’s first ability may apply here].
```
1. Ring-bearer player’s turn: Frodo must move.
    [Meriadoc’s Company card’s first ability may apply here].
2. Ringwraiths’ turn: 1 turn for each Nazgûl.
3. Nazgûl encounter (if Frodo was successfully hunted).
4. Advance the turn marker.

```
DAYLIGHT TURN 2
Repeat steps 1–4 above.
```
```
NIGHTFALL TURN
```
1. Ring-bearer player’s turn: Frodo may move or rest.
    [Samwise’s and Meriadoc’s Company cards’ first abilities
    may apply here].
2. Ringwraiths’ turn: 1 turn for each Nazgûl.
3. Nazgûl encounter (if Frodo was successfully hunted).
4. Reset the turn marker to turn 1.

```
REFRESH STEP
```
1. The Ring-bearer player draws 1 ally card.
    [Peregrin’s Company card’s first ability may apply here].
2. If there is more than 1 Ringwraith player, the current lead
    player gives the lead player token to the Ringwraith player to
    their left.
3. The lead player (only) draws 1 sorcery card and rolls all the
    action dice.
4. The Ring-bearer player gets 1 fellowship token from
    the fellowship pool (and places it on Frodo’s company card)
    for each shadow result rolled.

## RING-BEARER’S TURN

```
Each turn, the Ring-bearer player can take each of the following
actions once, in any order:
a. Move Frodo (or rest).
b. Play 1 ally card.
c. Spend 1 fellowship token to draw an ally card.
During the daylight turns, Frodo must move. During a nightfall
turn, Frodo may either move or rest.
Company cards grant the Ring-bearer player additional abilities.
The top part shows a constant ability; the bottom part shows an
ability which can be used once, after which the card is flipped
and neither of its abilities are available anymore.
```
## MOVE FRODO

```
The Ring-bearer player looks at Frodo’s current position
(marked on the journey log), then records either a dot or a
location number in pencil in the next empty space. Then
advance the Frodo figure 1 space on the movement track.
```
```
Entering a numbered location indicates that Frodo has reached
a specific place. The last numbered entry on the journey log
is Frodo’s last location. The Ring-bearer player can mark a
location as Frodo’s new move if the location is connected to
Frodo’s last location, and if the location is within reach. It can
be one he has moved to before (even his last location).
Entering a dot indicates that Frodo is in the wild, between his
last location and the next one: his last location is still considered
the numbered location recorded last on the log.
```
```
The Ring-bearer player can always mark a dot as Frodo’s new
move regardless of the last location, and of how many dots in a
row are already marked on the log.
```
```
If a company card or an ally card allows Frodo to move, such a
move can be in addition to a normal move, and can be executed
at nightfall without corruption or flipping the turn marker. For
each such move, advance the figure on the movement track and
record the move in the log, as usual.
```
```
When moving, Frodo is unaffected by the position of any Nazgûl
figures.
```
## THE NIGHTFALL TURN

```
If Frodo moves at nightfall, Frodo gains 1 corruption: advance
the marker 1 space on the corruption track. Then the Ring-
bearer player records his move normally.
```
```
Flip the turn marker to show the eye side, to remind
the Ringwraith players that they will have a free hunt
instead of a search this nightfall turn.
```
```
Flip the Turn marker back to the ring side at the end of the
nightfall turn.
```
```
If Frodo rests at nightfall, nothing is recorded on the journey log;
the Frodo figure is not advanced, corruption does not increase,
and the turn marker remains on the ring side.
```
## PLAY 1 ALLY CARD

```
The Ring-bearer player may have a maximum of 5 ally cards in
hand at any time; when this hand limit is exceeded, they must
immediately discard down to 5 cards of their choice.
During their turn, the Ring-bearer player can play from their
hand a maximum of 1 ally card, before and/or after they have
resolved Frodo’s move or rest action for the turn.
```
```
A condition in bold text must be true in order to play the card.
When 2 effects are shown on a card, the Ring-bearer player
must choose one of the effects. Ally card effects are mandatory
and must be applied as fully as possible.
```
```
Place played ally cards in a discard pile. Do not reshuffle the
cards when the deck is exhausted.
```
```
Any number of cards marked out of turn can be played only
during the individual turns of the Nazgûl, and the Ring-bearer
player may wait until the Ringwraith player declares a specific
effect before deciding whether to cancel it.
```
```
Some ally cards allow the Ring-bearer player to put
ally tokens in play. They must be placed on
locations not containing a Nazgûl or another ally
token. As an effect of some ally cards, they can
move directly to any other connected location, if that location
does not contain a Nazgûl or another ally token. Ally tokens can
move through dots containing Nazgûl.
```
```
A Nazgûl cannot enter, or move through, a location containing
an ally token. Sorcery cards allowing a search or a hunt cannot
target a location with an ally token (perception is unaffected).
There can be a maximum of 8 ally tokens in play at once. The
Ring-bearer player may remove ally tokens anywhere on the
board when a card allows him to place an ally and no token is
available.
```
```
Ally tokens removed by a Nazgûl spending a sword die result
are placed back among the available tokens.
```
```
The Ring-bearer player may place a company log
token to mark a space targeted by an ally card effect
requiring identification.
```
## SPEND 1 FELLOWSHIP TOKEN

```
During their turn, the Ring-bearer player may return
up to 1 fellowship token from Frodo’s company card
to the fellowship pool to draw 1 ally card.
```
```
Additional fellowship tokens can be spent in conjunction with
the play of a company or ally cards to achieve a card effect. This
does not count against the limit of 1 per turn.
```
```
Additional tokens may be received as an effect of an ally card
and Frodo’s company card ability.
The Ring-bearer player may never have more fellowship tokens
in play than those in the fellowship pool. Unspent fellowship
tokens are kept from day to day.
```
## RINGWRAITHS’ TURN

```
The Ringwraith players take actions in clockwise order,
activating the 4 Nazgûl, one after the other, starting with the
lead player. The active Nazgûl may both move and take 1 action
(in any order).
```
```
The action may either require spending an action die, or it can
be a free action. Normally, the only free action is a search, if the
active Nazgûl is in a location.
```
```
However, during a nightfall turn, when the turn marker is flipped
to its eye side, the active Nazgûl performs a hunt if in a location
instead of a search.
```
## MOVE NAZGÛL

```
A Nazgûl figure moves to an adjacent space (dot or location).
Moving is never mandatory. If the movement is entirely
performed on a road, a Nazgûl may move up to 3 spaces. During
a nightfall turn only, a Nazgûl may move up to 2 spaces along a
path, or a combination of path and road.
```
```
A Nazgûl can never move into or through an exit location or any
location containing an ally token.
```
```
Nazgûl figures do not block or hinder the movement of other
Nazgûl, and more than one can occupy the same space (use the
corresponding Nazgûl tokens if necessary).
```

## SPEND AN ACTION DIE

The Ringwraith player may spend a die result from the action
dice pool to take an action. This may be spent before or after
moving the active Nazgûl, instead of a free action (a search or,
during nightfall, a hunt). Spent dice are not available again until
the next Refresh step.

```
Spend a ring result to:
```
- Perform a perception in the area where
    the active Nazgûl is located; or
- Perform a perception in the section
    where the active Nazgûl is located.

```
Spend a sword result to:
```
- Perform a hunt in the location
    occupied by the active Nazgûl; or
- Remove an ally token from a location
    adjacent to the active Nazgûl.

```
Spend a sorcery die result to:
```
- Draw 1 sorcery card; or
- Play 1 sorcery card.

```
Spend a shadow die result as if it were a ring,
sword, or sorcery result (player’s choice).
```
When a Nazgûl is in a dark location, the Ringwraith player may
spend any action die result as if it were a sorcery result.

## SEARCH

A search can be performed as a free action before or after you
move an active Nazgûl, if the Nazgûl is in a location and you
choose not to spend an action die. A sorcery card may also allow
a search.

Ask the Ring-bearer player if the location currently occupied by
the active Nazgûl is featured on the journey log at least once.

The Ring-bearer player checks the location on the log, then
must answer truthfully with a yes or no.

```
If the answer is yes, the search is successful: place
a track token on the searched location, eye side up.
```
The Ring-bearer player is not required to reveal if the searched
location is Frodo’s last location or not.

If the answer is no, the search failed.

A search cannot be performed on any of Frodo’s starting
locations, and you cannot search in a location that already
has a track token on it (a hunt is allowed however).

## PERCEPTION

A perception can be performed by the active Ringwraith
player by spending a ring die result. A sorcery card may also
allow a perception.

The board is divided into sections (marked with a roman
numeral), each divided into areas (marked with a letter).

Choose if the perception is aimed at the area or the section
where the active Nazgûl is located. Then ask the Ring-bearer
player whether Frodo’s last location is inside the targeted area
or section.

The Ring-bearer player checks the location on the log, then
must answer truthfully with a yes or no.

```
If the answer is yes, place a Ringwraith log token
on the area or section.
```
## HUNT

```
A hunt can be performed by the active Ringwraith player in
a location (including one of Frodo’s starting locations) by
spending a sword die result.
```
```
If Frodo chose to move by night, thus flipping the turn marker
to the eye side, a Nazgûl can perform a hunt as a free action,
instead of a search, without spending an action die. A sorcery
card may also allow a hunt.
```
```
The Ringwraith player asks the Ring-bearer player if the
location currently occupied by the active Nazgûl is featured on
the journey log at least once. The Ring-bearer player checks
the location on the log, then must answer truthfully with a yes
or no.
```
```
If the answer is yes, the hunt is successful: place a track
token on the hunted location, sword side up.
```
```
If the location is also Frodo’s last location, the Ring-bearer
player must declare Frodo is here. When all Ringwraith players
are done taking their actions, a Nazgûl encounter ensues.
If the answer is no, the hunt failed.
```
## TOKENS

```
Track tokens are placed on the board with the appropriate side
up to mark a location where a search or a hunt was successful.
A location with a track token cannot be chosen to perform a
search, but such a location can be chosen to perform a hunt.
```
```
Track tokens do not hinder movement and remain on the board
until the end of Part 1. Frodo can always enter a location that
appeared previously on the journey log, even if it now contains
a track token.
```
```
Ringwraith log tokens may be used by the Ringwaith players as
reminders, in any way they see fit.
```
## SORCERY CARDS

```
Ringwraith players cannot show their hand of sorcery cards to
each other, and any communication concerning them must be
audible to the Ring-bearer player.
```
```
Each Ringwraith player can have a maximum of 5 sorcery cards
in hand, regardless of the number of Nazgûl under the player’s
control.
If this hand limit is exceeded, the Ringwraith player must
immediately discard down to 5 cards of their choice.
A condition in bold text must be true in order to play the card.
When 2 effects are shown on a card, the Ringwraith player must
choose one of the effects. Sorcery card effects are mandatory
and must be applied to their fullest extent possible. Effects
indicated as Part 2 are ignored during Part 1.
```
```
Place played sorcery cards in a discard pile. When the deck is
exhausted, shuffle the discards to form a new deck.
```
## INFORMATION TOKENS

```
When a Ringwraith player performs a search or a hunt
in an ally location, the Ring-bearer player checks to see
if its number appears on the information tokens drawn
during setup and hidden behind the screen.
```
```
If so, in addition to communicating the normal search or hunt
result and whether it was successful or not, they must reveal
the token and place it on the next available space on the Black
Riders reference card, immediately unlocking a new ability.
```
```
Mostly, Black Riders abilities grant to the Ringwraith players
additional uses for their action dice. The active Nazgûl can use
one of these abilities instead of the normal use of an action die
(and instead of a free search or hunt).
```
```
1 token Spend 1 action die result of your choice to move
1 additional space.
```
```
2 tokens Spend 2 action die results of your choice to perform
a hunt or a perception.
3 tokens Spend 1 sword result to move 1 additional space
and then perform a search.
4 tokens Spend 1 ring result to move 2 additional spaces.
5 tokens Start Part 2 with the Lord of the Nazgûl already
in play.
These abilities are cumulative.
If the Ring-bearer player marks on the log the number of
an ally location on one of the information tokens still in his
possession, that token cannot be collected anymore by the
Ringwraith player. The Ring-bearer player secretly flips the
information token to show its back, as a reminder it is not
considered to be in play anymore and the Ringwraith players
will not be able to find information in that location for the rest
of the game.
```
## ENCOUNTERING THE NAZGÛL

```
To resolve a Nazgûl encounter, perform these steps:
```
**1. DRAW CORRUPTION TILES**
    The Ring-bearer player must draw 1 corruption tile
    for each Nazgûl involved in the encounter. All
    Nazgûl in the hunted location or adjacent to it (both
    in a dot or a location) are involved.
**2. USE COMPANY CARDS**
When all tiles have been drawn, the Ring-bearer player
may flip up to 1 company card to use its ability to cancel a
corruption tile. The chosen tile is returned to the hunt pool
without effect. The special red corruption tiles cannot be
cancelled in this way.
**3. TAKE CORRUPTION**
Frodo’s corruption increases for each tile left, if any:
- If a tile is numbered, Frodo receives corruption points equal
    to its value, then the tile is removed from the game.
- If 1 eye tile is drawn, Frodo receives 1 corruption point, plus
    as many corruption points as the number of eye tiles already
    next to the corruption track, if any; then place the eye tile
    next to the corruption track.
- If more than 1 eye tile is drawn, apply the tiles one by one:
    Frodo gains corruption for the first eye tile, then it is placed
    next to the corruption track; then, apply the corruption gain
    for the second eye tile, and the tile is placed next to the
    corruption track, and so on.
**4. AFTERMATH**
If corruption is less than 12, the Ring-bearer player performs an
escape, and play resumes normally with their next turn.

```
If corruption is 12 or more, the Ring-bearer player loses the
game.
Corruption tiles drawn during an encounter, and not cancelled,
are out of play.
```
## ESCAPE

```
The Ring-bearer player must secretly choose between moving
Frodo to a new numbered location; or not moving Frodo at all.
```
```
If Frodo moves, the Ring-bearer player moves Frodo to a
location (that is not an exit location) within reach as if he had 2
bonus dots.
```
```
So, he moves to a connected location up to a distance of 2, plus
the number of dots marked on his journey log.
```
```
Enter the number of the chosen location in the next empty box
on the journey log, to the right of the last recorded move.
If Frodo does not move, the Ring-bearer player marks with a
slash the next empty space on the journey log, to the right of the
last recorded move. Frodo stays where he was on the previous
move.
```
```
In both cases, advance Frodo’s figure by 1 on the movement
track (whether he moved 1 or more spaces, or at all).
```
## END OF PART 1

```
Part 1 ends when one of the following situations applies:
```
## FRODO REACHES HIS DESTINATION

```
If Frodo reaches an exit location in 16 or less moves he must
immediately declare it. Frodo is safe and Part 1 is over.
```
## FRODO MUST BE RESCUED

```
As soon as the marker on the movement track reaches 16
(either because of a movement, or due to an escape) and Frodo
did not reach an exit location, Part 1 is immediately over (the
Ringwraith players do not get to play their turns).
```
```
Then the Ring-bearer player must count the number of moves
that Frodo would need to reach the closest exit location, and
draw an equal number of corruption tiles, raising Frodo’s
corruption level accordingly. For each numerical or eye tile,
increase Frodo’s corruption normally. The Ring-bearer player
may flip 1 company card to cancel 1 corruption tile, just as
during a Nazgûl encounter.
```
## FRODO IS CORRUPTED

```
If Frodo’s corruption level reaches 12 at any time (including
during a rescue), the Ringwraith players win instantly (without
playing Part 2).
```
## STORING THE GAME AFTER PART 1

```
If you wish to play Part 2 in a separate gaming session, store the
following materials in the Letter from Gandalf envelope:
```
- unspent fellowship tokens;
- company cards not flipped;
- the Ring-bearer player’s hand of ally cards;
- all the sorcery cards in the hands of the Ringwraith players
    (return the remaining sorcery cards to the box, keeping the
    draw deck separate from the discard pile);
- information tokens found by the Ringwraiths;
- discarded corruption tiles;
- special corruption tiles that were put in play;
- any eye tiles the Ring–bearer player has (including
    the Fear of the Barrow-wights sorcery card, if played).
Return all the remaining components to the box. Finally,
record on Frodo’s journey log the amount of corruption he
accumulated by the end of Part 1.


## PART 2: FLIGHT TO THE FORD

If Frodo was not defeated at the end of Part 1, the game
continues with Part 2.

These components are not required: the deck of Part 1 Ally
cards (green back); the information tokens (except those
collected by the Ringwraith players); Frodo’s starting location
tokens; any discarded corruption tiles; and any company cards
that were flipped in Part 1 (keep Frodo’s card, even if flipped).

## SETUP

If necessary, open the Letter from Gandalf envelope and
distribute the components (sorcery cards that were left in the
hands of the Ringwraith players at the end of Part 1 should be
taken out of the envelope by a Ringwraith player). Otherwise
each player just keeps their components at hand.

All the players assume the same roles they assumed during Part

1. Place the board to show the Part 2 side.

Ring-bearer player

Setup the Ring-bearer’s screen with the Part 2 board image
vertical. Fold a blank sheet of paper to size, insert it into the
journey log, and place that at the bottom of the screen with the
Part 2 side faceup.

Take the company cards you had at the end of Part 1 and add
the Strider and Meriadoc Brandybuck cards (unless Meriadoc
entered play already in Part 1), with their ability visible.

Take the Gandalf reference card.

Take the fellowship tokens you had at the end of Part 1 and
place them on Frodo’s card. Prepare the fellowship pool by
taking the appropriate amount of fellowship tokens (3 if Frodo is
not flipped, or 2 if Frodo is flipped, minus any tokens on Frodo’s
card) and placing them on the journey log.

Shuffle the journey cards into 2 decks: shorter and longer. Draw
1 card from each deck, look at them and choose 1 to keep as
your current journey card. Put the other card back into its deck.
Keep the deck corresponding to the card you chose, and return
the other deck to the box (without revealing it).

Place your journey card behind the screen, on the appropriate
space of the journey log.

Shuffle the ally deck for Part 2 (orange card frame), then discard
the ally cards you had at the end of Part 1, drawing an equal
number of cards from the new deck.

Place the turn marker on the leftmost daylight box of the turn
track, ring side faceup.

Place the corruption marker on the corruption track, in the box
matching Frodo’s corruption at the end of Part 1 (recorded on
the Part 1 journey log).

Place any eye corruption tiles in possession of the Ring-bearer
player (including the Fear of the Barrow-wights sorcery card, if
played) next to the corruption track.

Place the Frodo figure on the 0 space of the movement track.

Randomly draw 4 Gandalf’s deed tokens and look at them
secretly. Then, choose 1 and place it on the appropriate box in
the journey log to mark Gandalf’s starting location.

Keep the other 3 drawn tokens behind the screen, on the
appropriate space on the journey log. Set aside the remaining
tokens without showing them to the Ringwraith players.

```
Ringwraith player(s)
Divide the Nazgûl figures and the corresponding Ringwraith
cards among the Ringwraith players. Those controlling 2 or more
Nazgûl arrange their cards in the order they want them to act
during the game.
```
```
Place the Black Riders reference card in view of all players, with
the information tokens collected in Part 1 on the card.
```
```
Return the sorcery deck and sorcery discard pile as they were
at the end of Part 1. Take the sorcery cards you had in hand at
the end of Part 1 and redistribute them among the Ringwraith
players as you see fit.
Form the hunt pool, adding to the corruption tiles not drawn
during Part 1 the 3 corruption tiles for Part 2 (grey), along with
any special tiles brought into play during Part 1. Do not put back
in the pool corruption tiles discarded during Part 1.
```
```
Place the Ringwraith log tokens and the figure, card and special
die for The Lord of the Nazgûl within reach. Give the lead player
token to 1 Ringwraith player chosen at random.
```
```
Starting with the lead player, all Ringwraith players place their
Nazgûl figures on the board, 2 in each of the 2 available starting
locations (28 and 33). If the fifth ability on the Black Riders
reference card is unlocked, the Lord of the Nazgûl replaces the
Nazgûl/one of the Nazgûl of the lead player.
```
```
The lead player takes the 6 Ringwraith action dice (the action
dice pool) and rolls them. The Ring-bearer player takes 1
fellowship token from the fellowship pool for each shadow result
rolled, and places the token(s) on Frodo’s company card.
```
## RING-BEARER’S TURN

```
Frodo’s movement during Part 2 is determined by a journey
card. One deck contains shorter itineraries requiring 14 moves,
and allowing Frodo to be corrupted at 12 corruption points.
The other contains longer itineraries requiring 16 moves, but
allowing him to be corrupted at 14 corruption points.
```
## MOVE FRODO

```
At the start of each daylight turn, advance Frodo’s figure on
the movement track by 1 space. At the start of a nightfall turn,
decide if Frodo moves (and advances 1 space) or rests.
Frodo’s movement is determined by the journey card. The left
column corresponds to the occupied position on the track, while
the right column shows where Frodo is on the board.
```
## GANDALF THE GREY

```
During Part 2, the Ring-bearer player records Gandalf’s moves
secretly, using the journey log.
```
```
Gandalf moves every turn, daylight or nightfall, directly from
his current location to any connected location (dots between
locations do not affect his movement).
```
```
The Nazgûl can only detect Gandalf in his last location.
All the previous entries are ignored for any hunt purposes,
and a search can never detect him.
The Ring-bearer player may reveal Gandalf if, after moving,
he is in a location with 1 or more Nazgûl. Spend 1 fellowship
token (permanently removing it from the game and reducing the
fellowship pool by 1), then place Gandalf’s figure on the board,
on his last location.
```
```
Then, the Ring-bearer player moves all Nazgûl in that location
up to 2 spaces away (together or separately), and discards
1 standard action die from the Ringwraith action pool (Ring-
bearer player’s choice, but not the Lord of the Nazgûl action
die). The die will be added to the pool again during the next
Refresh step.
```
```
In the Ringwraith turn after Gandalf is placed on the board, no
Nazgûl can enter, or move through, the location Gandalf’s figure
occupies. Also, the location cannot be targeted by any search or
hunt (from playing a sorcery card, for example).
```
```
When all the Ringwraith players are done with their turns,
remove Gandalf’s figure from the board. Then, the Ring-bearer
player draws 2 new Gandalf’s deed tokens and chooses 1,
recording the corresponding location on the next empty box on
the journey log. Remove the token from play, and place the other
back among the available Gandalf’s deed tokens.
```
```
If Gandalf is in a location corresponding to 1 of the
Gandalf’s deed tokens still behind the Ring-bearer
player’s screen, the Ring-bearer player may reveal it
and place it close to the corruption track, faceup:
Gandalf has completed one of his deeds.
```
```
Completing a deed requires that Gandalf’s location is announced
to the Ringwraith players; however, Gandalf is not placed on the
board, and the Nazgûl are not chased away.
```
```
The maximum corruption that Frodo can withstand is raised by
1 for each deed completed by Gandalf.
```
```
If, at any time during the game, Gandalf reaches any exit
location, the Ring-bearer player may announce it, placing
Gandalf’s figure in Rivendell. From then on, Gandalf is out of
play, and the maximum amount of corruption that Frodo can
withstand is raised by 1.
```
## RINGWRAITHS’ TURN

```
Frodo’s position can be determined, at any time, by matching
where Frodo’s figure is on the movement track with the
appropriate row of the journey card. Any location above that row
is considered to have been moved through. Any location on the
journey card below that row has not been moved through yet,
and it is not considered to be ‘featured on Frodo’s Journey Log’
for the purposes of a search, a hunt, or any other effect.
```
## PERCEPTION

```
When a Ringwraith player performs a perception, if the last
location of Frodo or Gandalf (or both) is inside the target area or
section, the Ring-bearer player answers with a yes.
```
```
A perception performed using the special result on the Lord of
the Nazgûl die is an exception to this rule.
```
## SEARCH

```
A search performed in a location featured on Frodo’s current
journey card successfully locates him (the Ring-bearer player
answers with a yes).
```
```
Gandalf can never be located by a search: searching a location
featured on his journey log always results in a no answer
(including his last location).
If a search is performed in a location appearing both on Frodo’s
current journey card and on Gandalf’s journey log, a track token
is placed to mark the passage of Frodo only.
```
## HUNT

```
A hunt performed in a location featured on Frodo’s current
journey card is resolved normally and, if it is the last location, a
Nazgûl encounter ensues.
```
```
A hunt succeeds in locating Gandalf only if it is performed in his
last location (all other entries in the journey log are ignored).
When this happens, the Ring-bearer player declares that
Gandalf has been found. Then, he draws 1 new Gandalf’s deed
token, entering its number on the next empty space on the
journey log as Gandalf’s new location, then discards it without
showing it.
```

If a hunt is performed in Gandalf’s last location, and the same
location appears on Frodo’s journey card, Gandalf is found and
flees, and a track token is placed to mark the passage of Frodo.

If Gandalf is found by a hunt in a location that corresponds also
to Frodo’s last location, Gandalf is found and flees, a track token
is placed, and a Nazgûl encounter begins.

## THE LORD OF THE NAZGÛL

If the Lord of the Nazgûl enters play using a Captain of the Nine
sorcery card, replace the currently active Nazgûl with the Lord,
swapping their figures and placing the corresponding character
card on top of that of the replaced Nazgûl.

When the Lord is in play, add his special action die to the
Ringwraiths action pool and roll it with the other action dice in
the next Refresh step. The Lord is considered a Nazgûl for the
purposes of card effects, and of any rule not explicitly modified
here.

Each turn, the Lord may move and take one of the following
actions (as usual, before or after moving):

a. Spend an action die; or

b. Perform a hunt (if in a location): this does not require the
spending of an action die.

If the Lord is involved in a Nazgûl encounter, the Ring-bearer
player draws 2 corruption tiles due to his presence, instead of

1. At the end of the encounter, the Lord leaves play: replace him
with the corresponding Nazgûl.

## THE LORD OF THE NAZGÛL DIE

This die can be used by any Ringwraith player. Once rolled, its
result and effects cannot be cancelled, modified, or re-rolled.
If the Lord leaves play, remove it from the pool at the end of the
current day.

#### Spend a morgul ring result to:

- Perform a perception in the area where the active
    Nazgûl is located; or
- Perform a perception in the section where the
    active Nazgûl is located. If successful, the Ring-
    bearer player must specify who is inside the area
    or the section: Frodo, Gandalf, or both.

```
Spend a seek result to:
```
move all Nazgûl 1 space (starting with the active
Nazgûl).

#### Spend a morgul shadow die result as if it

```
were a ring, sword, or sorcery result (player’s
choice). However the Ring-bearer player does not
receive 1 fellowship token.
```
## ENCOUNTERING THE NAZGÛL

## ESCAPE

```
When Frodo escapes at the end of the encounter, the Ring-
bearer player must choose between:
```
1. Changing course by replacing the current journey card with a
    new one; or
2. Keeping the current journey card (and position) to resume
    playing normally (normally a good option only if Frodo is
    about to reach an exit location).
This choice is declared to the Ringwraith players.

## CHANGING COURSE

```
If the Ring-bearer player chooses to replace the current journey
card with a new one:
```
1. Move Frodo’s figure back 1 space on the movement track.
2. Discard all track tokens on the board.
3. The Ring-bearer player discards the old journey card and
    secretly draws a new card from the same deck (same length
    of journey).

```
If Strider’s company card has not been flipped, his ability may be
used at this time.
```
```
The selected card is now Frodo’s current journey card. The new
position of Frodo is determined normally by matching where
Frodo’s figure is on the movement track with the appropriate row
of the journey card.
```
## END OF PART 2

```
Part 2 ends when one of the following applies:
```
## FRODO REACHES RIVENDELL

```
If the Frodo figure reaches the space of the track (14 or 16)
corresponding to the last entry of the current journey card, the
game is immediately over and the Ring-bearer player wins.
```
## FRODO IS CORRUPTED

```
If Frodo’s corruption level reaches or exceeds the current
corruption threshold (determined by the journey card, plus
1 for each completed Gandalf’s deed, plus 1 if Gandalf is in
Rivendell), the game is immediately over and the Ringwraith
players win.
```
## BALANCING THE GAME

## EASIER FOR THE RINGWRAITHS

```
During Part 1 setup, when the Ring-bearer player must choose
1 information token to give to the Ringwraith players, give them
2 tokens instead (choosing them among the 5 tokens drawn
randomly, thus keeping only 3 instead of 4).
```
## EASIER FOR THE RING-BEARER

```
The Ring-bearer player gives the Ringwraith players no
information tokens at all, keeping all 5.
```
```
On each longer journey card, ally locations marked with a round
dot to the right of their name are shelters. If Frodo’s last location
is a shelter, the Nazgûl can find Frodo only by performing a hunt
(a search always fails). If the shelter is not Frodo’s last location,
a search succeeds in finding Frodo’s passage and a track token
is placed normally.
```
```
To give further help to the Ring-bearer player, also set the initial
pool of fellowship tokens to 4 (instead of 3).
```
## WAR OF THE RING

```
Depending on the ending of the Hunt for the Ring game, players
receive action tokens during the setup of War of the Ring:
```
```
Frodo is corrupted during Part 1, or before space 8 on the
movement track in Part 2:
Shadow: 2 tokens
```
```
Frodo is corrupted during Part 2, at space 8 or later on the
movement track:
Shadow:1 token
```
```
Frodo has reached Rivendell with no company cards:
Shadow and Free Peoples: 1 token each
```
```
Frodo has reached Rivendell with 1 or 2 company cards:
Free Peoples: 1 token
```
```
Frodo has reached Rivendell with 3 or more company cards:
Free Peoples: 2 tokens
```
```
A player who receives only 1 token may choose which to take.
If you play War of the Ring with the Lords of Middle-earth
expansion, these tokens are in addition to any action tokens the
Shadow player receives when the Free Peoples player starts the
game with companions outside the Fellowship (as indicated by
the Council of Elrond optional rules).
```
## ACTION TOKENS

```
A player may use 1 action token during action resolution in War
of the Ring, in place of using an action die result.
```
```
Each action token can only be used once during the game and
can only be used for its specific effect. Only 1 action token can
be used in a turn.
```
```
Action tokens are not counted among the number of actions
available to a player for the purpose of deciding if they can pass
an action.
An action token cannot be used as Any Action Die result (to
activate an event card or character ability with such a wording)
and cannot be modified by an Elven ring.
```
```
In a multi–player game, either Free Peoples player may use a
Free Peoples action token, and either Shadow player may use a
Shadow action token.
```
```
Shadow action token effects:
Move Nazgûl and minions (same as the option allowed
by a Shadow character die result).
```
```
Advance a Shadow nation on the political track (same as
the option allowed by a Shadow muster die result).
```
```
Free Peoples Action token effects:
Draw 1 event card (same as the option allowed by a Free
Peoples event die result).
Advance a Free Peoples nation on the political track
(same as the option allowed by a Free Peoples muster
die result).
```

space, then advance Frodo 1 space on the movement track.
Frodo’s move is unaffected by Nazgûl figures.

A dot means Frodo is in the wild. The last numbered entry is
Frodo’s last location. The RB can mark a location as Frodo’s new

```
RB must draw 1 corruption tile for each Nazgûl in the hunted
location or adjacent to it (in a dot or a location).
```
**2. USE COMPANY CARDS**
RB may flip up to 1 company card to use its ability to cancel
a corruption tile (not red tiles).
**3. TAKE CORRUPTION**
Frodo’s corruption increases for each tile left, if any:
- Numbered tile: take corruption equal to its value,
    then remove the tile from the game.
- 1 eye tile: 1 corruption point, plus as many points as the
    number of eye tiles already next to the corruption track. Then
    place eye tile next to the track.
- More than 1 eye tile: apply the tiles one by one.

```
Corruption less than 12: RB escapes, play resumes.
Corruption is 12+: RB loses the game.
```
```
ESCAPE
RB must secretly choose between moving Frodo or not.
```
```
If Frodo moves, the Ring-bearer player moves Frodo to a location
(that is not an exit location) within reach as if he had 2 bonus
dots.
```
```
If Frodo does not move, RB marks with a slash the next empty
space on the journey log. Frodo stays where he was.
```
```
In either case, advance Frodo 1 space on the movement track.
```
## PART 2: FLIGHT TO THE FORD

## RING-BEARER’S TURN

```
Frodo’s movement is determined by the journey card. The left
column corresponds to the occupied position on the track, and
the right column shows where Frodo is on the board.
```
```
GANDALF THE GREY
Record Gandalf’s moves secretly on journey log. Gandalf moves
every turn: daylight or nightfall, from location to location.
```
```
Nazgûl can only detect Gandalf in his last location. All previous
entries are ignored for hunts. A search can never detect him.
```
```
RB may reveal Gandalf if, after moving, he is in a location with
1 or more Nazgûl. Spend 1 fellowship token (remove it from the
game), then place Gandalf’s figure on his last location. Then
the RB moves all Nazgûl in that location up to 2 spaces away
(together or separately), and discards 1 standard action die from
the RW action pool (not the Lord of the Nazgûl die).
```
```
In the RW turn after Gandalf is placed on the board, no Nazgûl
can enter, or move through, that location, and it cannot be
targeted by any search or hunt.
```
```
When the RW players are done, remove Gandalf from the board.
Then, the RB draws 2 Gandalf’s deed tokens and chooses 1,
entering its number on the next empty box on the log. Remove
the token from play.
```
```
If Gandalf is in a location corresponding to 1 of the Gandalf’s
deed tokens still behind the RB’s screen, the RB may reveal it
and place it close to the corruption track, faceup: Gandalf has
completed one of his deeds. Gandalf is not placed on the board,
and the Nazgûl are not chased away.
```
```
The maximum corruption Frodo can withstand is raised by 1 for
each deed completed by Gandalf.
```
```
If at any time Gandalf reaches any exit location, the RB may
announce it, placing Gandalf’s figure in Rivendell. From then on,
Gandalf is out of play, and the maximum amount of corruption
that Frodo can withstand is raised by 1.
```
## RINGWRAITHS’ TURN

###### PERCEPTION

```
If the last location of Frodo or Gandalf (or both) is inside the
target area or section, the RB answers with a yes.
```
```
SEARCH
Searching a location featured on Gandalf’s journey log always
results in a no (including his last location).
```
```
If a search is performed in a location appearing both on Frodo’s
current journey card and on Gandalf’s log, a track token is
placed to mark the passage of Frodo only.
```
```
HUNT
A hunt succeeds in locating Gandalf only if it is his last location.
RB declares Gandalf has been found, draws 1 new Gandalf’s
deed token, enters its number on the next empty space on the
log as Gandalf’s new location, then discards it.
```
```
If a hunt is performed in Gandalf’s last location, and the same
location appears on Frodo’s journey card, Gandalf is found and
flees, and a track token is placed to mark the passage of Frodo.
If Gandalf is found by a hunt in a location that is also Frodo’s last
location, Gandalf is found and flees, a track token is placed, and
a Nazgûl encounter begins.
```
## THE LORD OF THE NAZGÛL

```
When the Lord is in play, add his special action die to the pool.
Each turn, he may move and take one of these actions:
a. Spend an action die; or
b. Perform a hunt if in a location (does not require action die).
```
```
If the Lord is involved in a Nazgûl encounter, the RB draws 2
corruption tiles instead of 1. At the end of the encounter, the
Lord leaves play: replace him with the corresponding Nazgûl.
```
```
The Lord of the Nazgûl die can be used by any RW player. Its
result and effects cannot be cancelled, modified, or re-rolled.
```
#### morgul ring:

- Perform a perception in the Nazgûl’s area; or
- Perform a perception in the Nazgûl’s section.
    If successful, RB must specify who is inside the
    area or the section: Frodo, Gandalf, or both.

```
seek:
move all Nazgûl 1 space (start with the active Nazgûl).
```
#### morgul shadow: Treat as if it were a ring,

```
sword, or sorcery result (player’s choice).
The RB does not receive a fellowship token.
```
## ENCOUNTERING THE NAZGÛL

```
When Frodo escapes, RB must choose and declare to either:
```
1. Replace the current journey card with a new one; or
2. Keep the current journey card/position and resume playing.

```
If the RB chooses to replace the current journey card with a
new one:
```
1. Move Frodo’s figure back 1 space on the movement track.
2. Discard all track tokens on the board.
3. RB discards the old journey card and secretly draws a new
    card from the same deck.

```
Strider’s ability may be used if his card has not been flipped.
```
```
The selected card is now Frodo’s current journey card. The new
position of Frodo is determined normally by matching where
Frodo’s figure is on the movement track with the appropriate row
of the journey card.
```
## ENCOUNTERING THE NAZGÛL

###### 1. DRAW CORRUPTION TILES

RB must draw 1 corruption tile for each Nazgûl in the hunted
location or adjacent to it (in a dot or a location).

**2. USE COMPANY CARDS**
RB may flip up to 1 company card to use its ability to cancel
a corruption tile (not red tiles).
**3. TAKE CORRUPTION**
Frodo’s corruption increases for each tile left, if any:
- Numbered tile: take corruption equal to its value,
    then remove the tile from the game.
- 1 eye tile: 1 corruption point, plus as many points as the
    number of eye tiles already next to the corruption track. Then
    place eye tile next to the track.
- More than 1 eye tile: apply the tiles one by one.

Corruption less than 12: RB escapes, play resumes.
Corruption is 12+: RB loses the game.

**ESCAPE**
RB must secretly choose between moving Frodo or not.

If Frodo moves, the Ring-bearer player moves Frodo to a location
(that is not an exit location) within reach as if he had 2 bonus
dots.

If Frodo does not move, RB marks with a slash the next empty
space on the journey log. Frodo stays where he was.

In either case, advance Frodo 1 space on the movement track.

## PART 2: FLIGHT TO THE FORD

## RING-BEARER’S TURN

Frodo’s movement is determined by the journey card. The left
column corresponds to the occupied position on the track, and
the right column shows where Frodo is on the board.

**GANDALF THE GREY**
Record Gandalf’s moves secretly on journey log. Gandalf moves
every turn: daylight or nightfall, from location to location.

Nazgûl can only detect Gandalf in his last location. All previous
entries are ignored for hunts. A search can never detect him.

RB may reveal Gandalf if, after moving, he is in a location with
1 or more Nazgûl. Spend 1 fellowship token (remove it from the
game), then place Gandalf’s figure on his last location. Then
the RB moves all Nazgûl in that location up to 2 spaces away
(together or separately), and discards 1 standard action die from
the RW action pool (not the Lord of the Nazgûl die).

In the RW turn after Gandalf is placed on the board, no Nazgûl
can enter, or move through, that location, and it cannot be
targeted by any search or hunt.

When the RW players are done, remove Gandalf from the board.
Then, the RB draws 2 Gandalf’s deed tokens and chooses 1,
entering its number on the next empty box on the log. Remove
the token from play.

If Gandalf is in a location corresponding to 1 of the Gandalf’s
deed tokens still behind the RB’s screen, the RB may reveal it
and place it close to the corruption track, faceup: Gandalf has
completed one of his deeds. Gandalf is not placed on the board,
and the Nazgûl are not chased away.

The maximum corruption Frodo can withstand is raised by 1 for
each deed completed by Gandalf.

If at any time Gandalf reaches any exit location, the RB may
announce it, placing Gandalf’s figure in Rivendell. From then on,
Gandalf is out of play, and the maximum amount of corruption
that Frodo can withstand is raised by 1.
