- Instead of building a civilization, players manage a small group of heroes
- The game is scenario-based rather than an open-ended sandbox
- Resource management is more limited, focusing on hero resources rather than city production
- Combat is card-based rather than unit-based

## Key Information

## Condensed Rules Summary

### Objective:
Work together as a team of heroes to complete quests and defeat enemies in Middle-earth.

### Setup:
1. Each player chooses 1-3 hero cards and a 50-card player deck.
2. Set initial threat level (sum of heroes' threat cost).
3. Draw 6 cards for your starting hand.
4. Choose a quest and prepare the quest deck and encounter deck.

### Game Round:
1. Resource Phase
   - Add 1 resource to each of your heroes
   - Draw 1 card

2. Planning Phase
   - Play ally and attachment cards using hero resources

3. Quest Phase
   - Commit characters to the quest
   - Reveal encounter cards
   - Compare total willpower vs. total threat

4. Travel Phase
   - Optionally travel to one location

5. Encounter Phase
   - Enemies may engage players

6. Combat Phase
   - Enemies attack
   - Players attack enemies

7. Refresh Phase
   - Ready all exhausted cards
   - Increase threat by 1
   - Pass first player token

### Key Concepts:
- Use resources from your heroes to play cards
- Exhaust (turn sideways) characters to use them
- Progress tokens advance quests
- Damage tokens reduce hit points

### Winning and Losing:
- Win by completing the final quest stage
- Lose if all players are eliminated (threat reaches 50 or all heroes defeated)

### Resource Match
To play a card, spend resources from a hero with a matching sphere of influence icon.

### Questing
During quest resolution, compare total willpower of committed characters against total threat in the staging area.

### Engagement
Enemies automatically engage a player if their engagement cost is equal to or lower than the player's threat level.

### Shadow Cards
During combat, deal one shadow card to each engaged enemy. These may have additional effects.

### Threat
Players are eliminated if their threat reaches 50.

### Deck Construction
Player decks must have a minimum of 50 cards and can include up to 3 copies of any card.

### Spheres of Influence
There are four spheres: Leadership (blue), Lore (green), Spirit (white), and Tactics (red).

### Victory and Defeat
Players win by completing the final quest card. Players lose if all are eliminated before completing the quest.

### Common Keywords
- Ranged: Can attack enemies engaged with other players
- Sentinel: Can defend for other players
- Surge: Reveal an additional encounter card when this card is revealed

---
## Factions/Civilizations
- Leadership (blue): Strong allies and support abilities
- Lore (green): Card draw and healing effects
- Spirit (white): Threat reduction and questing power
- Tactics (red): Combat-focused with powerful attackers

## Additional Notes
The game features an extensive card pool with regular expansions, allowing for diverse deck-building strategies and replayability. It can be played solo or cooperatively, with difficulty scaling based on the number of players.

# Lord of the Rings The Card Game - Rules

[[Lord of the Rings LCG.pdf]]

## SETUP

Each player shuffles his **player deck** (keeping his hero
cards separate) and places it facedown in front of him.

He then places his **heroes** faceup in front of him, adds
up their **threat cost** , and sets his **threat tracker** to this
starting level. Choose or randomly determine a **first player**
to take the first player token.

Each player draws **6 cards** from the top of his player deck
as his setup hand. A player may take a single _mulligan_ ,
by shuffling these cards back into his deck and drawing 6
new cards (he must keep his second hand).

Choose a **quest** , and arrange the **quest cards** in sequential
order with _Stage 1A_ on top and the numbers increasing in
sequence under it.

Remove cards from the **encounter deck** that do not
relate to the current quest, and shuffle the deck. Place
it facedown next to the quest deck, in the center of the
play area. Place **damage** , **progress** , and **resource** tokens in
piles next to these decks.

Follow any other setup instructions on the first quest card,
then flip it. Then begin the game with the first round.

Whenever a card is discarded, it goes to the discard pile
belonging to the card’s originating deck.

## ROUND SEQUENCE

### 1. Resource

**Each player simultaneously adds 1 resource token to each
of his heroes’ resource pools** (each hero has one pool).

**Each player then draws 1 card** from his player deck and
adds it to his hand.

### 2. Planning

In this phase only, players (starting with the first player
and going clockwise) may play **ally** and **attachment** cards
from their hand.

To play a card or activate certain card effects, spend
**resource tokens** from the resource pool of a hero who
has a resource icon that matches the card’s sphere of
influence (this is called a **resource match** ).

**An exhausted hero may still spend resources**.

Cards with zero cost still require at least one hero under
that player’s control to have a matching resource icon.

Played ally or attachment cards are placed faceup and
ready in the player’s play area. Attachment cards are
placed partially overlapping the card they attach.

A player with multiple heroes with similar resource icons
may use resources from multiple pools of the same sphere
to pay for a single card or effect.

**Neutral cards** (no sphere of influence) require no
resource match and can be paid for with any hero’s
resources. You may also combine resources from heroes
with different resource icons.

```
Triggering a card ability from a card already in play
requires no resource match (unless specified).
```
```
Characters and attachment cards enter the game ready
(faceup in front of their controller). A used card is turned
90º and exhausted. It cannot exhaust again until readied.
```
### 3. Quest

```
Players may take actions and play event cards at the end
of each of the following steps.
```
```
Step 1: Commit Characters
Each player may commit as many characters as desired
to the current quest card, exhausting them. Do this as a
team, starting with the first player and going clockwise.
```
```
Step 2: Staging
Reveal 1 card per player from the encounter deck ; one at
a time, with any ‘ when revealed’ effects resolved before
the next is revealed. Enemy and location cards revealed
are placed in the staging area , treachery cards are
resolved and (unless indicated) discarded.
```
```
If the encounter deck is empty during this phase, shuffle
its discard pile to form a new encounter deck.
```
```
Step 3: Quest Resolution
Players compare the combined willpower of all
committed characters against the combined threat of
all cards in the staging area.
```
```
is higher: a number of progress tokens equal to the
amount by which overcame are placed on the
current quest card. If there is an active location , tokens
are placed on that location until it is explored, with the
remainder placed on the current quest.
```
```
is higher: each player must raise his threat dial by the
amount by which was higher than.
```
```
is equal to : nothing happens.
```
```
Characters remain committed to the end of this phase,
unless removed from the quest by a card effect. They
remain exhausted after this step.
```
### 4. Travel

```
Players may travel as a group to any one location in the
staging area by moving it alongside the current quest
card, making it the active location. The players can only
travel to one location at a time, and cannot travel to a
new location if another location is active. The first player
makes the final decision on whether and where to travel.
In the staging area, location cards add to the encounter
deck’s. Once a location is active, it no longer
contributes its , but acts as a buffer for the currently
revealed quest card. Any progress tokens that would be
placed on a quest card are instead placed on it.
```
```
If a location ever has as many progress tokens as it has
quest points, it is explored and discarded from play.
```
```
When a card effect removes progress tokens from a quest
card, the effect applies specifically to the quest card, and
never to the active location.
```
### 5. Encounter

```
Step 1: Player Engagement
Each player has the option to engage one enemy by
moving it from the staging area to in front of the engaging
player. An enemy’s engagement cost has no effect.
```
```
Step 2: Engagement Checks
The first player makes an engagement check by
comparing his threat level against the engagement cost of
each of the enemy cards remaining in the staging area.
```
```
The enemy with the highest engagement cost that is
equal to or lower than this threat level engages this
player, moving to the space in front of him.
The player to his left then makes his own engagement
check against each of the remaining enemy cards.
Continue this process with all players in clockwise order.
Starting again with the first player, players continue
making engagement checks until there are no enemies
remaining in the staging area that can engage any players.
```
### 6. Combat

```
All enemies engaged with players attack first each round,
and the players resolve those attacks one at a time.
Deal 1 shadow card (the top card of the encounter deck)
facedown to each engaged enemy.
Cards are first dealt to the enemies attacking the first
player, and then proceed clockwise all enemies have a
card. When dealing to a single player’s enemies, deal to
the enemy with the highest engagement cost first.
```
```
If the encounter deck runs out, any enemies that have not
been dealt shadow cards are not dealt them this round.
```
```
Resolving Enemy Attacks
Follow these steps in order. Players may play event cards
and take actions at the end of each step:
```
**1. Choose an enemy.** The first player chooses which attack
(among enemies to which he is engaged) to resolve first.
**2. Declare defender.** Only one character can be declared
as a **defender** against each attacking enemy, and must
_exhaust_ to do so. An attack may also go **undefended** , with
no defenders declared for that attack.

```
Unless an effect specifies otherwise, you can only declare
defenders against enemies with whom you are engaged.
```
**3. Shadow effect.** The active player flips that enemy’s
shadow card faceup and resolves any shadow effect.
**4. Determine damage.** Subtract the defending character’s
**defense strength** from the attacking enemy’s **attack
strength** to find the damage immediately dealt to
the defending character. If a character is destroyed,
additional damage is wasted. If the result is 0 or negative,
no damage is dealt.

```
All damage from an undefended attack must be assigned
to a single hero ( not an ally) controlled by the active
player. If a defending character leaves play or combat
before damage is assigned, the attack is undefended.
```
```
does not absorb damage from undefended attacks or
card effects.
```
```
If you use card effects to declare multiple defenders
against a single attack, the defending player must assign
all damage from that attack to a single defender.
```
```
The first player repeats these steps for each enemy he is
engaged with. Then proceed clockwise around the table
with each player resolving all of his enemies’ attacks.
Once an attack has resolved, characters are no longer
considered ‘defenders’, but they remain exhausted.
```

**Attacking Enemies**
Starting with the first player and going clockwise, each
player may declare one attack against each enemy with
which he is engaged once each round.

Follow these steps in order. Players may play event cards
and take actions at the end of each step:

**1. Declare target of attack, and declare attackers.**
Choose one enemy with whom you are currently engaged,
and _exhaust_ any number of characters as **attackers**.
**2. Determine attack strength.** Add up the total **attack
strength** of the attacking characters that have been
declared against that target.
**3. Determine combat damage.** Subtract the target
enemy’s **defense strength** from the total of all
attacking characters to find the damage immediately
dealt to the target. If the result is 0 or negative, no
damage is dealt.

After your first attack is resolved, you can declare another
attack against any eligible enemy target that you have not
yet attacked this round (if you have the ready attackers).
Once your attacks resolve, proceed clockwise around the
table with each player resolving all of his attacks.

Once an attack is resolved, characters are no longer
considered ‘attackers’, but they remain _exhausted_.

For each point of damage dealt to a character or enemy,
1 **damage token** is placed on its card, reducing its hit
points by 1. These remain until another effect heals or
moves them off of the card, or until the card leaves play.

A card with 0 hit points is immediately **defeated**.
Characters are placed in their owner’s discard pile;
enemies are placed in the encounter discard pile. When
resolving effects that move cards from a player’s discard
pile to his hand or deck, hero cards are ignored, as hero
cards cannot move to a player’s hand or deck.

Any enemy cards not defeated remain engaged with a
player until they are defeated or removed by a card effect,
or until that player is eliminated from the game.

**Shadow cards** remain in place throughout this phase. If
that enemy leaves play, discard its shadow card. At the end
of the phase, discard all shadow cards dealt this round.

### 7. Refresh

All _exhausted_ cards _ready_ , **each player increases his
threat by 1** , and the first player passes the first player
token to the next player clockwise.

## QUEST ADVANCEMENT

Players immediately advance to the next stage of a quest
when they place **progress tokens** equal to or greater than
the number of **quest points** the current quest card has.
Additional progress tokens _do not_ carry over; all tokens
on the quest are returned to the token bank when players
advance to the next stage. Follow any instructions on the
newly revealed quest card. The state of other cards does
not change, and the round sequence is not interrupted.

## ENDING THE GAME

Players win or lose as a team. Players lose if all are
eliminated before the completion of the final stage of the
scenario deck. Players win if at least one player survives
through the completion of the final stage of the scenario.

```
A player is eliminated if all his heroes are killed, his threat
level reaches 50 , or a card effect forces his elimination.
His hand, all of the cards he controls, and his deck are
placed in their owners’ discard piles. Any encounter cards
with which that player was engaged are returned to the
staging area, retaining any wound tokens on them. The
remaining players continue to play the game.
```
```
Note that after a player is eliminated, one less encounter
card is revealed during the quest phase.
```
## CARD EFFECTS

```
If two or more conflicting effects occur simultaneously,
the first player decides the order in which they resolve.
```
```
If an encounter or quest effect targets a single player
or card, and there are multiple eligible targets, the first
player selects the target from among the eligible options.
```
```
Constant Effects continually affect the game state
as long as the card is in play and any other specified
conditions are met. These effects have no bold trigger, as
they are always active.
```
```
Actions are denoted by a bold Action: trigger. They are
optional, and can be triggered by their controller during
any action window in the game sequence. The card with
the action must be in play, unless the action specifies
it can be triggered from an out of play state. Event card
actions are played directly from your hand.
```
```
Action triggers preceded by a specific game phase mean
the action can only be triggered during that phase.
```
```
Responses are denoted by a bold Response: trigger. They
are optional, and can be triggered by their controller
immediately after a specified occurrence. The card
with the response must be in play, unless the response
specifies it can be triggered from an out of play state.
Event card responses are played directly from your hand.
```
```
Forced Effects are denoted by a bold Forced: trigger.
They are initiated and immediately resolved by specific
occurrences, and occur automatically whether the card’s
controller wants them to or not.
```
```
When Revealed Effects are denoted by a bold When
Revealed: trigger. They occur automatically as soon as the
encounter card is revealed (but do not resolve when the
card is revealed as a shadow effect).
```
```
Shadow Effects are offset from a card’s other effects by
a ‘halberds and skull’ graphic, in italic type, and denoted
by a bold italic Shadow: trigger. They only resolve when
the card is dealt to an attacking enemy during combat.
```
```
Travel Effects are denoted by a bold Travel: trigger. They
are costs or restrictions that some or all players must pay
or meet in order to travel to that location. If they cannot
do so, they cannot travel to that location.
```
## OTHER RULES

```
Lasting Effects
Effects that last for longer than a single action are lasting
effects.
```
```
Multiple lasting effects may affect the same card at
the same time. The order in which they take place is
irrelevant, since the net sum of all lasting effects is
applied to the card.
```
```
If one of a hero’s, ally’s, enemy’s, or location’s statistics
is ever lower than 0 after all effects are applied, that
statistic is rounded up to 0. Any time a new effect is
applied to a card, the net sum of all active effects should
be recalculated.
```
```
Paying Costs
When confronted with a ‘ pay or exhaust X to do Y ’
construct, everything before the ‘to’ is considered the
cost , and everything after the ‘to’ is considered an effect.
```
```
Costs can only be paid with cards or resources that a
player controls. If an effect is canceled, the cost is still
considered to have been paid.
```
```
Control and Ownership
A player ‘owns’ his heroes and the cards he has chosen
for the player deck he is playing. A player ‘controls’
all cards that he owns, unless another player or the
encounter deck takes control of the card through a game
effect. Any time a card leaves play, it reverts to its owner’s
hand, deck, or discard pile (as directed by the effect
forcing it out of play).
When a player plays an ally card, it comes into play
under his control and is placed in his play area. If
another player takes control of that ally, it is moved to the
controlling player’s play area. Ally cards cannot be played
under the control of another player, they can only change
control through card effects.
When a player plays an attachment card, he has the
option of giving control of that card to another player
by attaching the card to one of that player’s characters.
Players always assume control of attachments that
have been played on their characters. If control of that
character changes, so does the control of any attachments
on that character.
```
```
If an encounter card becomes an attachment and
attaches to a character, that character’s controller does
not gain control of the attachment.
```
```
When a player claims an objective card, he gains control
of that card unless otherwise directed by a card effect.
```
```
In Play and Out of Play
In play refers to cards that have been played or put into
play (in a player’s play area), to cards that are waiting in
the staging area, to the currently revealed quest card, and
to encounter cards that are engaged with that player.
```
```
Out of play states are ‘in a player’s hand’, ‘in a deck’, or
‘in a discard pile’. Card effects do not interact with cards
in an out of play state unless the effect specifically refers
to that state.
```
```
Running Out of Cards
If a player runs out of cards in his player deck, he
continues to play the game with the cards he has in play
and in his hand. He does not reshuffle his discard pile.
```
```
If the encounter deck is ever out of cards during the quest
phase, the encounter discard pile is shuffled and reset
back into the encounter deck.
```
```
Table Talk
Players may talk to one another during play, and work as a
team to plan and execute the best course of action. They
may discuss anything, but cannot name or read out loud
directly from cards in their hand, or from cards they have
seen but the rest of the players have not.

## SELECTED KEYWORDS

**Archery X** While this card is in play, players must deal
damage to character cards in play (under any player’s
control and divided as the players see fit) equal to X at the
beginning of each Combat phase. The effects from multiple
cards are cumulative. does not block archery damage.

**Ambush** When this enemy enters play, each player, starting
with the first player and proceeding clockwise, must make
an engagement check (only against this enemy). If the
enemy engages a player as the result of this effect, no
further engagement checks are made against it.

**Battle** When characters are committed to this quest, they
count their total instead of when resolving the quest.

**Doomed X** When revealed any time (including setup), _each
player_ must raise his threat level by the specified value.

**Guarded** When revealed any time (including setup), reveal
and attach the next card of the encounter deck to the
objective card when it enters the staging area, and place
them _both_ in the staging area. The objective cannot be
claimed as long as any encounter card is attached. Once
that encounter is dealt with, the objective remains in the
staging area until claimed. If another objective card comes
up while attaching a card for the guarded keyword, place the
second objective in the staging area, and use the _next_ card
of the encounter deck to fulfill the original keyword effect.

Enemy and location cards attached to guarded objectives
_do_ still count their while they are in the staging area.
An encounter card attached to a guarded objective is dealt
with as follows:

```
An enemy card leaves play, either by being defeated or as
the result of a card effect.
A location card leaves play, either by being fully explored
or as the result of a card effect.
A treachery card has its effects resolved, or canceled.
```
Once all encounter cards attached to a guarded objective
are dealt with, players can claim the objective in the manner
specified by its text.

**Hide X** The player who revealed the card must make a **Hide
test**. If the card also has a _When Revealed_ or _Forced_ effect,
the test must be resolved before resolving the rest of the card.

To make a Hide test, commit (exhaust) any number of
characters you control to the test, then discard the top

or as the result of a card effect.
