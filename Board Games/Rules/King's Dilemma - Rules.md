## Condensed Rules Summary
1. Game Setup:
   - Each player chooses a House screen (represents your noble family)
   - Set up the Realm board in the center of the table
   - Place resource markers on their starting positions
   - Shuffle the dilemma cards and place them face-up in a deck

2. Game Concept:
   - You are advisors to the king, making decisions that shape the kingdom
   - Each round, you'll face a dilemma and vote on how to resolve it
   - Your choices affect the kingdom's resources and stability

3. Playing a Round:
   a. Reveal a Dilemma:
      - Read the top card of the dilemma deck aloud
      - The card presents a problem and two possible solutions

   b. Discussion:
      - Discuss the dilemma as a group
      - Consider the potential consequences for the kingdom and your House

   c. Voting:
      - Each player secretly chooses a vote card: Aye (yes), Nay (no), or Pass
      - Reveal votes simultaneously
      - The side with more votes wins (Passes don't count)

   d. Resolve the Outcome:
      - Read the outcome text for the winning side
      - Adjust resources and stability as indicated on the card
      - Some outcomes may add new cards to the deck or apply stickers to the board

4. Check for Game End:
   - The game ends if:
     - The kingdom becomes too unstable (marker reaches end of track)
     - You run out of dilemma cards
     - A specific ending condition is triggered by a card

5. Scoring:
   - At the end of each game, players score Agenda Points
   - The player with the most Agenda Points wins that session
   - Also record Prestige and Crave Points on your House screen for long-term scoring

6. Legacy Elements:
   - Your choices permanently alter the game:
     - Sign cards to show who made certain decisions
     - Add stickers to the board to represent lasting changes
     - New cards enter the deck based on your choices
   - These changes carry over to future games, creating an ongoing story

7. Campaign Play:
   - The full story unfolds over multiple game sessions (about 15 total)
   - Try to keep the same player group throughout the campaign
   - The overall winner is determined by total Prestige, Crave, and achieved goals

---

## Factions/Civilizations
- Players choose unique House screens representing different noble families
- Each House has its own background and long-term goals/achievements
- No inherent gameplay differences between Houses

Houses aim to gain the most prestige over the course of the campaign while also pursuing their individual agendas and achievements.

## Additional Notes

### Legacy Elements
- Players permanently alter game components by:
  - Signing cards and stickers
  - Adding new cards to the dilemma deck
  - Placing stickers on the game board
- These changes carry over between games, creating a unique narrative

### Moral Choices
- Dilemmas often present ethically challenging situations
- Players must decide between what's best for the kingdom and what benefits their House
- Choices can lead to war, famine, prosperity, or other far-reaching consequences

### Resource Management
- Players track five key resources: 
  1. Military
  2. Knowledge  
  3. Population
  4. Wealth
  5. Morale
- These resources affect the kingdom's overall stability

### Voting System
- Players can vote Aye, Nay, or Pass on each dilemma
- Votes are influenced by:
  - Personal agendas
  - Bribery and negotiation between players
  - Long-term consequences for the kingdom

### Campaign Structure
- The game is played over approximately 15 sessions
- Each session represents one monarch's reign
- The campaign ends when a specific ending condition is triggered

### Scoring
- Players earn Agenda Points during each game
- Prestige Points and Crave Points are accumulated over the entire campaign
- The overall winner is determined by a combination of these scores and achievement of House goals

### Replayability
- While the game has a finite number of plays, the branching narrative and player choices create a unique experience each campaign
- Multiple possible endings encourage replaying the entire campaign with different groups

This game offers a unique blend of storytelling, moral decision-making, and competitive gameplay, making it stand out in the legacy game genre.

# The King's Dilemma

This game is set in a fictional and often cruel fantasy world. It was
designed to put you in front of morally challenging situations and
tough choices. Many of the dilemmas you will face involve ethical
and moral choices related to sensitive topics that could upset your
sensitivity or that of the people playing with you, such as injustice,
violence, slavery, and racism. By design, the game will occasionally put
you in front of the uncomfortable choice between what you think is
right, and what is best for winning. Remember that this is a just game,
and you‚Äôre playing a fictional character. Even if the game world follows
elements of the real world, nothing should be taken as real.

None of the atrocities described in _The King‚Äôs Dilemma‚Ñ¢_ are in
any way promoted, encouraged, or even considered as acceptable
by the publisher, designers, scriptwriters, nor the distributors of
this game.

A LEGACY-LIKE EXPERIENCE

```
The King‚Äôs Dilemma is a unique interactive narrative experience,
featuring several branching storylines that lead to many possible
endings. The game will also require you to permanently sign cards,
stickers, and player screens, and the game board will also be irreversibly
altered as game events unfold. The number of games you will be able
to play is finite, and it will vary depending on the choices you take
during your adventure. On average, you will play about 15 hours of
gameplay, corresponding to about 15 games. When the story comes
to its end, the game is over and it cannot be reset and played again
from the beginning.
```
```
Note: To enjoy the game experience of The King‚Äôs Dilemma‚Ñ¢ to the
fullest, we strongly suggest that you always play with the same group
of people. However, it‚Äôs not a problem if a particular player skips a
few games. The game also provides more House screens than what is
needed for a single match, making it possible to have new people join
an ongoing game (up to a total of 12 people).

Formerly an independent kingdom, the Duchy of Gamam was annexed by Ankist in the year 130, after the army of that kingdom surrounded the capital city of Golden Harbor. Also known as the people of
the lobster, you are skilled tradesmen and hard workers. You are constantly busy people, and you spend a lot of time complaining that you have no time to enjoy the fruits of your labor and your generous
land. You are haunted by the fact that life is too short. The people of Gamam developed a special sensitivity to luxury and beautiful things. You are proud of your efficiency and wealth, and you often complain
that you pay too much in taxes. You feel that your relationship with the central government of the kingdom is one-way: you give a lot to the Crown, without receiving anything back but more taxes. From
the outside, you are seen as demanding, arrogant, and fussy, but also elegant and sophisticated. Your capital city is clean and safe. All your people, including you and your family, complain that life ends too
soon. You would give anything to have more time to enjoy the wealth you accumulate during your hard-working life.

Story cards are always the
first card in their envelopes.
They may have a special ability
and/or a Signature space on
their front, and they explain a
portion of the game story on
their back. Ending cards are a
special kind of Story cards (see

Ending cards

Dilemma cards are the most
common kind of card in the
game. Their front side presents
you with a problem, asks you a
question, and shows a preview
of the two possible outcomes
(AYE or NAY). Their back side
describes the two outcomes
in detail. To determine which
outcome will be chosen, you
will have to perform a Vote (see
page 16).
```
```
Event cards are only contained
in Special Envelopes (see page
27). They must be placed in
the Event area of the Realm
board, and describe the special
rules for the corresponding
game event. These cards may
need to be saved and restored
between different games until
the event is complete.
```
```
Trigger cards are mostly found
in Special Envelopes (see page
27), with a few exceptions.
They are usually shuffled into
the Dilemma deck and trigger
special events when they
are drawn. They may need
to be saved and restored
between different games until
the corresponding event is
complete.

GAME OVERVIEW

```
In The King‚Äôs Dilemma, players become the representatives of various influential families (or ‚ÄúHouses‚Äù) and
members of the King‚Äôs Council. Historically, the kings of Ankist always placed an absolute trust in their Council,
so the real power lies in their hands: they are the real leaders of the government of Ankist.
```
```
Each round, you will draw a card from the bottom of the Dilemma deck and experience the game story
unfold. Each card is unique, and it will pose you a problem (or Dilemma) that the Council will have to solve on
the King‚Äôs behalf. You will have to discuss, bargain, and make decisions that will shape the story of the game
and determine the fate of the Kingdom of Ankist. Each time a Dilemma card is resolved, it is permanently
removed from the Dilemma deck. Occasionally, though, your decisions will result in the addition of completely
new cards to the deck, unlocking new events that will happen in the future as a consequence of your decisions.
```
```
You will have to keep the kingdom going while also seeking an advantage for your own House; this power
struggle may lead the kingdom into war, famine, or riot, or it could generate wealth and well-being. It will
depend on your choices! Each decision has consequences, though: what is good for the kingdom as a whole
may be bad for your House. Will you act for the greater good, or will you think only of yourself?
```
```
At the end of each game, you will score Agenda Points ( ). Agenda Points are used to determine the
winner of that game. Additionally, depending on how you ranked during the game and the circumstances that
triggered the end of the game, no matter if you won or not, you will also score Prestige Points and/or
Crave Points that you must record on your House screen. Both are ‚Äúendgame points‚Äù that will help you
shape the ultimate fate of Ankist, and determine the overall winner of your campaign.
```
BEFORE YOUR FIRST GAME

1. Prepare Your Starting Dilemma Deck

```
Open Envelope 00 (see page 26) and take out its contents (q). Read the first card included in the Envelope
(the Story card), then place it on the Realm board, in the Storyline space with the same symbol (w). Afterwards,
shuffle the remaining Dilemma cards (e) and cover them with the Cover tile (r). This will be your starting
Dilemma deck; use it when you are asked to take the Dilemma deck from the box during Step 7 of the Game
Setup (see page 9). Always make sure to keep all the Dilemma cards face up, and never read the text on
the back side of the cards until you are explicitly allowed to do so (see page 15)!

If you are reading this you are definitely a scrupulous person. Your attention
to detail is commendable, but it was an unnecessary effort: this is just placeholder text. On the other hand,
congratulations for your good eyes!

The game will occasionally ask to sign something
(Story cards, Chronicle stickers, and so on). Signing
Chronicle stickers and Story cards indicates that you are
responsible for your decisions and their consequences,
as determined by how you voted to resolve the different
Dilemmas you have faced during the game, and how the
game story will progress as a result.

Formerly an independent kingdom, the Duchy of Gamam was annexed by Ankist in the year 130, after the army of that kingdom surrounded
the capital city of Golden Harbor. Also known as the people of the lobster, you are skilled tradesmen and hard workers. You are
constantly busy people, and you spend a lot of time complaining that you have no time to enjoy the fruits of your labor and your generous
land. You are haunted by the fact that life is too short. The people of Gamam developed a special sensitivity to luxury and beautiful things.
You are proud of your efficiency and wealth, and you often complain that you pay too much in taxes. You feel that your relationship with
the central government of the kingdom is one-way: you give a lot to the Crown, without receiving anything back but more taxes. From
the outside, you are seen as demanding, arrogant, and fussy, but also elegant and sophisticated. Your capital city is clean and safe. All your
people, including you and your family, complain that life ends too soon. You would give anything to have more time to enjoy the wealth
you accumulate during your hard-working life.

2. Choose a House Screen

```
Once you choose a House screen, it will always be your House screen, and you will
have to use it in every subsequent game of your campaign. It will allow you to track
your Prestige and Crave scores while you progress through the game story
(see page 33). It also lists several achievements: the long-term goals of your House.
For more details on the achievements available on your House screen, see page 13.
```
```
Note: You can add new players to your campaign even after you‚Äôve played some
games, but they must still choose a new House screen before their first game of The
King‚Äôs Dilemma and use it during every subsequent game. However, to fully enjoy the
game at its best, we strongly suggest that you always play the game with the same
group of people, from the start to the end of the campaign.
```
```
Before proceeding, write the name of your House on your screen. When you choose
the name of your House, feel free to use your real family name (e.g., ‚ÄúHouse Smith‚Äù),
a fantasy-like variant of it (e.g., ‚ÄúHouse Smeethe‚Äù), or a completely fictional name
of your choice (e.g., ‚ÄúHouse Humblescore‚Äù). Keep in mind, though, that this will also
be the name you will have to use every tim
