## Factions/Civilizations
This War of Mine does not have different factions or civilizations to choose from. Players control a group of civilian survivors, each with unique traits and backstories, but there are no gameplay differences based on faction choice.

## Additional Notes
The game is known for its emotional impact and difficult moral choices. It's based on the video game of the same name and aims to portray the civilian experience of war. The game can be quite challenging and may not be suitable for younger players due to its mature themes.

# This War of Mine - Rules
#### Setup

Characters interact with _all_ the characters as a group.
Choose a **leader** randomly at the start of the game. The
leader holds the _Book of Scripts_ and is the only player
who can touch the game components. When a decision
has to be made, all players may discuss the options, but
the final decision is made by the leader.

Shuffle the **Character** deck and draw 3 cards: the first red-
bordered card and the first 2 black-bordered cards. These
are your **starting characters**. Write their names on the save
sheet and place the cards faceup near the board with a
level 2 **hunger token** next to each.

Place the corresponding figures on the **GUARD** space on
the board. Attach a colored base to each that matches a
colored token placed on its character card.

There cannot be more than 4 characters in play at a time.

Place the remaining Character cards facedown on the
**CHARACTERS** space on the board.

Set aside the cards with a red corner in the **Night Raids**
and **Residents** decks. Then place all decks on their
corresponding board spaces. The **Fitting** cards with a
green corner go on the **FITTINGS** space, and the remaining
Fitting cards go on the **IDEAS** space.

Draw 3 cards from the **Locations** deck and place them
faceup on the 3 **LOCATION** spaces.

Place all the **Shelter** cards faceup (blue corner facedown)
on board spaces with a matching name, without looking
at them.

Place the **Event** cards facedown on the **EVENTS** space in
the following order from the bottom to the top: 3 shuffled
Ending Event cards; then the Chapter III card; then 4
random Event cards; then the Chapter II card; then 3
random Event cards; and finally the Chapter I card. Place
the remaining cards into the waste bag.

Place these tokens and resources on the **STORAGE** space: 1
lockpick, 1 shovel, 4 components, 4 wood, 2 water, and 3
raw food. Note the **STORAGE X5** space can be used to record
5 of a wood or components resource with one token.

Organise the remaining tokens and resources either in the
box compartments or on the table. You cannot have more
resources or tokens than those supplied. _Discard_ means
return to wherever you are storing components; they may
be used again. _Remove_ means place in a **‘waste bag’** ; they
cannot be used again until the end of the campaign.

When an effect raise or lowers a character’s **state** , indicate
the new level with an appropriate **state token**. Level 4
tokens give instructions for what happens at that level.

Never read the whole scripts aloud. Read them yourself
and then narrate what happened in your own words.
You can read aloud any quotes in _italics_. Whenever you
encounter a script with choices or a continuation to
another script, pass the _Book of Scripts_ and the role of
the **leader** to the next player.

#### Sequence of Play

#### 1. MORNING 200

```
Draw and resolve the top card of the Events deck (whether
it is an Event, an Ending Event, or a Chapter card).
```
#### 2. Day 300

```
Each character may perform up to 3 actions.
Black circles on state tokens possessed by a character
indicate which of the 3 actions (left to right, the dots
correspond to the first, second, and third rounds of
actions) are unavailable to that character. Update which
actions are available after resolving each action round.
```
```
At the beginning of each actions round, assign all the
available characters to their chosen actions, then resolve
the effects simultaneously.
Characters you cannot perform an action during an action
round can be placed in STORAGE to make things clear.
A character who has just joined the group cannot perform
an action during the action round in which they joined.
```
```
You may place characters on any Fitting/Shelter cards
and SHELTER spaces to which you have access. Characters
move instantaneously: horizontally (freely) and vertically
(using the ladder spaces). Movement paths are marked
with thick dark lines on the save sheet. Obstacles (bars,
locked door, rubble/rubble remnants, holes and boarded-
up holes) are impassable. The hole icon blocks horizontal
movement even if it is covered by a Board Up token.
```
```
Only 1 character can be placed on each Fitting/Shelter
card and on each SHELTER space. Any number of characters
may be on Rubble cards and the POKE ABOUT action space.
```
```
An action on a SHELTER space or a Fitting card means
discard the required resources/tokens (if any) from the
STORAGE space as soon as a character is assigned to the
action. Resources/tokens created as a result are placed on
the STORAGE space after the action has been resolved.
```
```
An action on a Shelter card means resolve its back. Some
require a particular token from STORAGE to also be placed
on the card: return it to STORAGE after resolving the action.
On a Rubble/Rubble Remnants card, instead of a shovel
you may place an additional character.
```
###### Closed Doors

```
A Closed Door card requires you to roll the black die:
Pick the lock (requires a lockpick )
1-3: no effect.
4-10: discard the lockpick,
then resolve the back of the card.
```
```
When Marko is using a hatchet instead of a lockpick, do
not discard the hatchet after opening a closed door.
```
###### Crafting Fittings

```
To place a new Fitting card, place any Fitting card from
the Fittings deck on an empty space in the shelter (any
space without a card or action or the GUARD or SLEEP ON THE
FLOOR options – you cannot place a card on the darkened
spaces on the save sheet), then place any character on it
and discard the required resources/tokens from STORAGE.
Flip the Fitting card faceup and resolve it.
```
```
Fitting cards in the Ideas deck are not available for
crafting until a character uses the NEW IDEA board action,
which enables you to choose any 2 cards from the Ideas
deck and add them into the Fittings deck. From that point
on, those 2 cards can be crafted as normal.
```
```
If a Fitting card says ‘place next to the ...’ , the card can
be crafted only in a space horizontally adjacent to the
required card.
```
###### Advanced Actions

- A character may use 1 action to move an already
    crafted Fitting card to an unoccupied space.
- A character may use 1 action to discard an already
    crafted Fitting card and add the resources and tokens
    required to craft that fitting to the **STORAGE**. If a Fitting
    card has a bonus for crafting it, ignore this bonus if it is
    crafted again after being dismantled.
- A character with no black dots on their state tokens
    may take an additional fourth action if they increase
    their fatigue by 2.

#### 3. DUSK 400

###### Water

```
Each character should drink 1 water (discard from STORAGE ).
For each character that does not, roll the black die:
1-5: raise the character’s hunger by 1.
6-10: raise the character’s misery by 1.
```
###### Hunger

```
Each character should eat 1 or more food (discard from
STORAGE ).
Canned Food: lower hunger by 2.
Raw Food: lower hunger by 1.
Vegetable: hunger stays the same.
No Food: raise hunger by 1.
```
```
A character may eat a food token at any time aside from
combat and script resolution (however, this does not free
the character from resolving hunger this phase).
```
#### 4. Evening 500

```
Assign each character to one of the following tasks. If a
character’s fatigue reaches 4 due to being assigned to a
task, first resolve the task, then the fatigue level.
```
###### Sleep in a bed

```
Place a maximum of 1 character on 1 Bed card.
Set their fatigue to 0.
```
###### Sleep on the Floor

```
Place any number of characters on the SLEEP ON THE FLOOR
space. Lower their fatigue by 2.
```
###### Guard Duty

```
There must be at least 1 guard. Place any number of
characters on the GUARD space (higher prowess is better).
Raise their fatigue by 1.
```
###### Scavenging

```
Place up to 3 characters on the FINDINGS PILE space
(higher inventory and prowess is better).
Raise their fatigue by 1.
```
#### 5. Scavenging 600

###### Choose a Location

```
Choose 1 of the 3 available Location cards and move all
the scavenging characters onto it. Note the rule on the red
space of the Location card, if there is one.
```
###### Choose equipment

```
Available weapons, equipment and/or tokens for possible
use and/or trade may be taken from STORAGE and placed on
the FINDINGS PILE space.
```
###### Set the Noise Marker

```
Place the noise marker on space 1 of the noise track. If
you must raise or lower the noise, move the marker up or
down on the track, respectively.
When you must roll for noise, roll the black die. If the
result is equal to or less than the current noise, an
encounter is triggered: set the noise to 1, then draw and
resolve the top Residents card. After resolving the card,
continue scavenging.
```
###### Prepare the Unknown Deck and Explore

```
Draw Exploration cards equal to the number of the
Location card you are exploring (10, 12, or 14) and place
them facedown on the UNKNOWN space. Now resolve them
one after the other.
```
```
If an encounter with a resident occurs while resolving
a Findings card, first resolve the Residents card, then
return to resolving the Findings card. If taking Findings
may result in consequences, you can first check what was
found and then decide whether or not to still take it.
Discarded cards are placed faceup on the DISCARD space.
Returned Exploration cards are returned facedown to the
Exploration deck. All items acquired during scavenging
are placed on the FINDINGS PILE space.
```
```
When the Unknown deck is depleted, exploration ends.
```
###### Choose Findings

```
Shuffle all Exploration and Residents cards into their
decks. You may now add as many resources (wood, water,
and components) to the FINDINGS PILE space as you wish.
You can bring back a total weight of tokens/resources
(including those brought with you) equal to the total
inventory of all scavenging characters. Each resource
weighs 1 , and an item without a icon weighs 0.
```
```
Scavenging characters and their findings return to the
shelter in the Dawn phase. They do not take part in the
Night Raid phase.
```
#### 6. Night Raid 700

###### Choose weapons for the guards

```
Any weapons in STORAGE may be placed on the GUARD
space. Each character may only wield 1 weapon.
```
###### Night Raid

```
Draw and resolve the top Night Raids card. Damage is the
amount of tokens/resources that must be discarded from
STORAGE. Wounds is the amount of wounds that must be
distributed among the characters on the GUARD space.
Roll the appropriate combat die for each character on the
GUARD space:
White die: no weapon.
Yellow die: melee weapon (hatchet, knife).
Red die: firearm (pistol, assault rifle, shotgun).
The number of icons shown is the amount you subtract
from suffered damage or wounds.
```
```
Firearms (pistol, assault rifle, shotgun): A character must
discard an ammo token to shoot.
Assault Rifle: You may discard 2 ammo instead of 1
to make 2 shots.
Shotgun: If you roll a , ignore the night raid card
currently in play.
```
```
Hatchet: If you roll a , ignore the night raid card
currently in play.
and icons are misses when using other weapons.
```

**Prowess:** A character’s prowess is the number of re-rolls
they may make during a night raid. You do not need to use
all of them, but **the last roll is considered final**.

**Board-Ups:** Every built Board-Up token subtracts either 1
wound or 1 damage.

###### Crime Wave

If there are any Night Raid and Residents cards with a red
corner still set aside, shuffle 2 cards in any combination
into their corresponding decks (without looking at them).

#### 7. Dawn 800

###### The Scavenging Party Returns

Move all the scavenging characters back into the shelter
and place all the tokens/resources they brought back with
them into **STORAGE**.

###### Assign Meds and Bandages

If there are any **meds** , **herbal meds** , or **bandages** in
**STORAGE** , you may assign them to the ill and wounded by
placing them on the chosen character cards.

###### draw a Fate card

Draw and resolve the top Fate card. If it tells you to
exchange a Location card, remove that Location card from
the game, slide the remaining Location cards down so the
**FAR** space is empty, then draw a new Location card and
place it on that space.

**Alcohol** may be used (discard it from **STORAGE** ) before or
after resolving a Fate card. A character with a fatigue of 4
cannot use alcohol.

**Moonshine:** raise 1 chosen character’s fatigue by 2
and lower their misery by 1. A character with a fatigue
of 3 can till can use Moonshine (raise their fatigue to 4).

**100% Alcohol:** raise 1 chosen character’s fatigue
by 1 and lower their misery by 1.

**Nearest location** means the Location card on the board
space with the highest number in the green icon.

When **resolving spirit** , resolve characters in any order.

###### Narrative Action card

Draw 2 Narrative Action cards, read them, choose one and
resolve it (shuffle the other back into the deck).

###### Death

If any character died or abandoned the group between
morning and dawn, roll the black die and compare the
result with each character’s **empathy**. If the result is equal
to or less than their empathy, raise their misery by 2.

#### Combat 900

When resolving a Residents card, A, B, and C tokens may
be drawn to represent enemies (you can skip this if you do
not intend to fight them). Place the tokens on the spaces
on the first column of the **combat chart** , depending on the
weapons the enemies possess.

Each of your characters may be assigned 1 weapon from
the **FINDINGS PILE** space (or from **STORAGE** when you fight in
the shelter).

During each round of combat, roll the appropriate
combat die for each character and enemy. Fighting is
simultaneous.

**White die:** no weapon.

**Yellow die:** melee weapon (hatchet, knife).

**Red die:** firearm (pistol, assault rifle, shotgun).

```
The number of icons shown is the amount of wounds
dealt. Distribute the wounds dealt by enemies among
the characters present (mark wounds with wound state
tokens). Distribute the wounds dealt by characters among
the enemies (mark wounds by sliding the token to the
right on the combat chart).
```
```
At the beginning of each round of combat a character or
enemy may change their weapon if they have another; eg.
if ammo runs out, they may change their pistol to a knife.
```
```
Prowess: A character’s prowess is the number of re-rolls
they may make during a night raid. You do not need to use
all of them, but the last roll is considered final. Enemies
use their prowess automatically; they re-roll the result only
if the result is 0 wounds.
```
```
Fleeing: Before each round of combat, you may choose to
flee. If you do, the enemies perform a backstab , then the
characters leave the location (go to Choose Findings).
```
```
Backstab: Only one side attacks; the other side canot
retaliate. Resolve the attack roll as normal. If performing a
backstab from a hiding place , after the backstab is resolved
(and if any enemies are still alive), regular combat begins.
```
###### Weapons

```
Firearms (pistol, assault rifle, shotgun): Shooters always
roll first; if they kill a non-shooting opponent, that
opponent does not get a chance to attack. A character
must discard an ammo token to shoot; if you are out of
ammo you must use another weapon or fight unarmed.
Enemies do not use ammo tokens. When an enemy rolls
the out of ammo icon slide that enemy to a new row
on the combat chart as appropriate.
Assault Rifle: You may discard 2 ammo instead of 1
to make 2 shots.
Shotgun: If you roll a , the target dies immediately.
```
```
Hatchet: If you roll a , the target dies immediately.
```
```
and icons are misses when using other weapons.
```
###### Trusting fate

```
If you or an enemy rolls a on a combat die, choose if it
is a miss or you trust fate. If you trust fate, draw a Fate
card and check the color of the combat die icon on that
card. If it matches the combat die rolled, resolve the text
below the icon. Otherwise the roll is a miss.
```
```
Jam/weapon loss: After combat is resolved, the character
gets their weapon back.
```
```
Dodge: The dodge refers to that combatant (enemy or
character) whose die roll introduced the Fate card into play.
```
###### Enemy Death

```
If you kill somebody (excluding thugs ), roll the black
die and compare the result with the empathy of each
character present. if the result is equal to or less than
their empathy, raise their misery by 1.
```
```
When characters get hold of a dead enemy’s firearm, and
the script does not specify how much ammo is with it,
there was no ammo left.
```
#### Trading

```
When a trade is allowed, you must first pay the trade
commission by discarding tokens of a total value equal
to that given in the trade’s description. Then, you can
exchange tokens by discarding your tokens of a total value
equal to or higher than the value of the tokens you want to
buy. Each token’s value is shown in the yellow icon.
```
```
Water, wood, and components cannot be bought or sold
and are never part of a trade.
```
#### Dying During Scavenging

```
If a character dies during scavenging , immediately after
resolving the scene, roll the black die and compare the
result with the empathy of each character present.
```
```
If the result is equal to or less than their empathy, the
character atops scavenging and is placed on the FINDINGS
PILE , to return to the game during the Choose Findings step.
```
```
If all characters die during scavenging , the Scavenging
phase ends immediately and no one brings anything back
to the shelter.
```
#### Advanced Rules

###### EATING AT ANY TIME

```
A character may eat a food token at any time aside from
combat and script resolution.
```
```
This is resolved the same way as during the Dusk phase,
but does not free the character from resolving hunger
during the Dusk phase.
```
###### EATING A CAT OR A DOG

```
Should players agree, they can allow eating a pet: remove
the cat from the game and add 2 Raw Food to STORAGE , or
remove the dog from the game and add 4 Raw Food.
```
```
Then roll the black die and compare the result with the
empathy of each character present. If the result is equal to
or lower than a character’s empathy, raise their misery by 1.
```
###### ASSIGNING MEDS AND BANDAGES AT ANY TIME

```
A character may use Meds or Herbal Meds or Bandages
tokens at any time aside from combat and script
resolution. They can work only when Fate cards are
resolved during the Dawn phase, in accordance with the
rule on the drawn Fate card.
```
###### ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AT ANY TIME

```
A character may use Moonshine or 100% Alcohol at any
time aside from combat and script resolution.
```
###### HIDING FINDINGS IN THE LOCATIONS

```
If players agree, they may hide in a location any tokens
or resources not taken back to the shelter, in the hope of
retrieving them during another trip to the same location.
To do so, place all these tokens on that location.
During the next visit to the location, roll the black die. On
1-6 discard these ‘hidden’ tokens and resources, and on
7-10 place them on the FINDINGS PILE.
```
```
Should the location be removed from game, the tokens
and resources are immediately discarded.
```
```
If you need to draw tokens or resources and there aren’t
any left, but there are some ‘hidden’ on a Location card,
you must take them from that location instead.
```
###### MORE INVENTORY

```
Each of the characters participating in scavenging can lift
1 weight more than their inventory indicates if they raise
their fatigue by 2. This means they cannot do this if their
fatigue is already 3 or 4.
```
###### EXCHANGING LOCATIONS

```
At the beginning or the end of scavenging you may return
4 Exploration cards to exchange any of the 3 locations
placed on the board with a new one drawn from the
Locations deck.
```
#### Advanced Side of the Board

```
The advanced side of the board has no IDEAS space. Put
all the Fittings cards on the one FITTINGS space.
```
```
The Sniper Fire rule refers only to the character who has
just performed an action on the shelter’s top floor.
```
```
Rules on the board spaces covered by Shelter cards are
ignored until that space is cleared.
```
```
2x Rubble cards in a space means that you must place 2
Rubble cards there during setup, and that the cards need
to be resolved one after the other.
```
#### Sleeping Characters

```
A sleeping character cannot do anything else besides:
```
- sleeping in a bed / sleeping on the floor during the
    Evening phase;
- take a **nap** action (on the Bed card) during the Day
    Actions phase (despite 3 black dots on the state token),
- eat and drink
- receive meds/herbal meds/bandages.

```
When resolving Fate cards during the Dawn phase, do not
resolve the spirit of this character.
```
```
Use common sense when resolving scripts when deciding
which effects apply to a sleeping character.
If the sleeping character’s fatigue increases to level 4 as
a result of the character being assigned to an action or to
scavenging / guarding, then the character performs this
action / scavenges / guards before they go to sleep.
```
#### Card FAQ

###### Events

```
Airdrop or Shelling: If drawn as the first event in a
campaign or continuing campaign, ignore their special
text (but add Cold tokens as normal).
Snipers: When one character is shot, the card is
immediately removed and there is no roll for the rest of
the characters.
Crime on the Rise or Crime Wave: Their effects do not stack.
```
###### Objectives

```
The first Event card of a campaign instructs you to set up
an Objectives deck. Each Objectives card is assigned to
a chapter of the game, as defined by the Events cards,
and rewards and penalties from an Objective card are only
resolved when the appropriate Chapter card is resolved.
```
```
You cannot start completing a later objective without
completing the current one.
```
```
If the Objective card has a counter on it, when it is
revealed place the Objective Status token on the leftmost
space. You can at any time discard the appropriate
resources from STORAGE to advance the token along the
track. When the token reaches the righmost space, the
objective is completed.
```
###### Forfeiting the Game

```
If, during a campaign, all the starting characters are lost
and the group is therefore unable to complete the final
objective , the players may forfeit the game, but they are
not required to.
```
```
It depends on whether they decide that only a complete
victory matters or that they wish to just allow the
remaining characters to reach the end of the story,
regardless of whether they win or lose the game.
```

#### Sequence of Play

#### 1. MORNING 200

**Draw and resolve the top card of the Events deck**.

#### 2. Day 300

**Each character may perform up to 3 actions.**
Black circles on a character’s **state tokens** indicate
which of the 3 actions are unavailable to them. At the
beginning of each actions round, assign all the available
characters to their chosen actions, then resolve the
effects _simultaneously_.

Place characters on any Fitting/Shelter cards and **SHELTER**
spaces to which you have access. Movement paths
are marked with thick dark lines on the save sheet.
Obstacles (bars, locked door, rubble/rubble remnants,
holes and boarded-up holes) are impassable.

###### Closed Doors Roll the black die:

**Pick the lock (requires a** **_lockpick_** **)**

1-3: no effect.
4-10: discard the lockpick,
then resolve the back of the card.

When _Marko_ is using a hatchet instead of a lockpick, do
not discard the hatchet after opening a closed door.

###### Crafting Fittings Place any Fitting card from the Fittings

**deck** on an empty space in the shelter, then place any
character on it and discard the required resources/
tokens from **STORAGE**. Flip the Fitting card faceup and
resolve it.

###### Advanced Actions

- Use 1 action to move an already crafted Fitting card
    to an unoccupied space.
- Use 1 action to discard an already crafted Fitting card
    and add the resources and tokens required to craft
    that fitting to the **STORAGE**.
- A character with no black dots on their state tokens
    may take an additional fourth action if they increase
    their fatigue by 2.

#### 3. DUSK 400

###### Water Each character should drink 1 water. For each that

does not, roll the black die:

1-5: raise the character’s **hunger** by 1.

6-10: raise the character’s **misery** by 1.

###### Hunger Each character should eat 1+ food.

**Canned Food:** lower hunger by 2.

**Raw Food:** lower hunger by 1.

**Vegetable:** hunger stays the same.

**No Food:** raise hunger by 1.

**A character may eat a food token at any time** aside from
combat and script resolution (but this does not free the
character from resolving hunger this phase).

#### 4. Evening 500

```

If you do, the enemies perform a backstab , then the
characters leave the location (go to Choose Findings).

retaliate. If performing a backstab from a hiding place ,
after the backstab is resolved (and if any enemies are
still alive), regular combat begins.

roll first; if they kill a non-shooting opponent, that
opponent does not get a chance to attack. A character

card. If it matches the combat die rolled, resolve the
text below the icon. Otherwise the roll is a miss.
```
###### Enemy Death

```
If you kill somebody (excluding thugs ), roll the black
die and compare the result with the empathy of each
character present. if the result is equal to or less than
their empathy, raise their misery by 1.
```
#### Advanced Rules

###### EATING AT ANY TIME

```

combat and script resolution. This is resolved the same
way as during the Dusk phase, but does not free the
character from resolving hunger during the Dusk phase.
```
###### EATING A CAT OR A DOG

```
Should players agree, they can allow eating a pet:
remove the cat from the game and add 2 Raw Food
to STORAGE , or remove the dog from the game and add

discard these ‘hidden’ tokens and resources, and on
7-10 place them on the FINDINGS PILE.
```
```
Should the location be removed from game, the tokens
and resources are immediately discarded. If you need to
draw tokens or resources and there aren’t any left, but
there are some ‘hidden’ on a Location card, you must
take them from that location instead.
```
###### MORE INVENTORY

```
Each of the characters participating in scavenging can
lift 1 weight more than their inventory indicates if they
raise their fatigue by 2. This means they cannot do this
if their fatigue is already 3 or 4.

return 4 Exploration cards to exchange any of the 3
locations placed on the board with a new one drawn

shelter).

#### Farmers

```
Add the 2 farmer miniatures, 2 Fitting cards, 1 Night
Raid card, 2 Resident cards, 1 Event card, and 1 Visitor
card from this expansion to the game. You must use the
basic side of the board. During setup, place the 2 new
Fittings cards on the board as described on the cards.
Shuffle the remaining new cards into their decks.
```
```
The farmer miniatures only enter the game when you
encounter farmers during an Outside action and you
decide to hire them.
```
#### Dog and Cat

```
Use the appropriate card, token, and miniature if you
encounter either of these animals and, as a result of a
script, decide to keep them in the shelter.
In campaign mode, you may start the game with one
chosen pet already in the shelter. If you do so, do not
add 3 Raw Food to STORAGE during setup.
```
#### Our Street

```
You can only use this expansion if you are not already
using the Tactics or Farmers expansions. Distribute the
4 new cards faceup next to the board in sequence.
```
```
Place all the soldiers , thugs , and farmers miniatures
next to the board. When a rule says to place one figure
on the board, place a miniature only if there are unused
miniatures of that type in the pool.
```
```
When a rule says to discard a figure, remove it from the
board (if it was present) and return it to the pool. If a
figure is placed on the OUTSIDE space or the FINDINGS PILE ,
choose from where it is removed.
```
#### Desperate Measures

```
Add the 7 Desperate Measures cards to the game.
When a character dies or abandons the group, draw a
Desperate Measures card. Keep it and use it at any time
as described on its back.
```
#### Hidden Objectives

```
Add the 6 Hidden Objective cards to the game. Each
player draws 1 Hidden Objective card at the start of the
game, reads it, and keeps it secret. When the conditions
on your Hidden Objective card are fulfilled, reveal the
card and remove it from the game.
In a scenario-based game, remove the Thief card from
the game.
```
#### Heart of the City

```
You can only use this expansion when playing in
campaign mode. Add the large angel statue miniature, 5
cards, and the Heart of the City booklet to the game.
After scavenging (but before Choose Findings), decide if
you also want to visit the heart of the city. If you do so,
draw 1 card from the Heart of the City deck and resolve
it. Then remove that card from the game. When there
are no cards left, the Heart of the City location becomes
unavailable for the rest of the campaign.
```
#### Orphans of War

```
Add the 2 orphan miniatures, 3 Orphans cards, 6
Fittings cards, 6 Kid Action cards, 1 Happiness token,
and the Orphans of War booklet (in the Heart of the City
booklet) to the game.
```
```
During setup, draw one of the 3 Orphans of War
cards. Place the corresponding miniatures in the
shelter on any space. Place the Fitting card Kid’s
Room as described on the card. Shuffle the rest of the
new Fittings cards into Fittings deck. Shuffle the Kid
Actions deck and place it next to the board.
```
#### Sewers advanced players

```
Add the 3 miniatures. 8 Sewers Map cards, 6 Room
cards, and 6 Corridors cards.
```
```
During setup, place the 3 decks by the board.
```
```
At the start of any Day actions phase, you may place any
number of characters on the Sewers deck. They cannot
perform any actions during this phase. At the end of the
phase, they begin their exploration.
First place the Sewers Starting Zone card faceup next
to the board and place any of the exploring character
miniatures on it on the room marked S. This marks the
location of the whole group (the group cannot split or
backtrack during exploration). Choose any path leading
to an exit on the edge of the card.
Resolve all the letters (draw a card from the Room deck
and resolve the corresponding letter) and numbers
(draw a card from the Corridors deck and resolve the
corresponding number) shown on the chosen path.
```
```
Then draw a new card from the Sewers Map deck and
match it to the card on the table, connecting your exit
path to an extrance on the new card. Move the miniature
to the new card, choose an exit, and resolve the letters
and numbers on the new card.
```
```
At any time, you may forfeit further exploration and
return to the shelter instead of drawing a new card from
the Sewers Map deck. Resolve the Choose Findings
stage, but you cannot add free resources to the FINDINGS
PILE.
```
```
Once you have placed the fourth Sewers Map card on
the table (not counting the Starting Zone ), the exit
leading to one of the 3 locations is marked on the card
in red. First resolve this room in the usual way, then roll
the black die:
1-5: Near location.
6-8: Distant location.
9-10 Far location.
Now you may begin scavenging in this location as you
would in a Scavenging phase. However, ignore all Reality
Impact cards, and halve the number of Exploration cards
in the Unknown deck.
```
###### Thugs and Resources (optional)

```
When you enter the sewers, you may place 0-3 thug
miniatures on the Starting Zone card. The number of
them determines the threat level during your sewer
exploration.
If you forfeit your exploration and return to the shelter,
roll the black die as many times as this threat level:
```
```
Result lower than or equal to threat level: Combat begins
with a number of thugs armed with knives equal to the
threat level. You may try to stop the fight (see 40 ). After
combat, remove the thug miniatures from the card (the
threat level is now 0) and see 33.
```
```
Result 6-8: Add 5 resources (water/wood/components)
to the FINDINGS PILE.
```
```
Result 9-10: Add 10 resources (water/wood/
components) to the FINDINGS PILE.
```
#### Farmers

Add the 2 farmer miniatures, 2 Fitting cards, 1 Night
Raid card, 2 Resident cards, 1 Event card, and 1 Visitor
card from this expansion to the game. You must use the
basic side of the board. During setup, place the 2 new
Fittings cards on the board as described on the cards.
Shuffle the remaining new cards into their decks.

The **farmer miniatures** only enter the game when you
encounter **farmers** during an Outside action and you
decide to hire them.

#### Dog and Cat

Use the appropriate card, token, and miniature if you
encounter either of these animals and, as a result of a
script, decide to keep them in the shelter.

In campaign mode, you may start the game with one
chosen pet already in the shelter. If you do so, _do not_
add 3 Raw Food to **STORAGE** during setup.

#### Our Street

You can only use this expansion if you are not already
using the _Tactics_ or _Farmers_ expansions. Distribute the
4 new cards faceup next to the board in sequence.

Place all the **soldiers** , **thugs** , and **farmers** miniatures
next to the board. When a rule says to place one figure
on the board, place a miniature only if there are unused
miniatures of that type in the pool.

When a rule says to discard a figure, remove it from the
board (if it was present) and return it to the pool. If a
figure is placed on the **OUTSIDE** space or the **FINDINGS PILE** ,
choose from where it is removed.

#### Desperate Measures

Add the 7 Desperate Measures cards to the game.
When a character dies or abandons the group, draw a
Desperate Measures card. Keep it and use it at any time
as described on its back.

#### Hidden Objectives

Add the 6 Hidden Objective cards to the game. Each
player draws 1 Hidden Objective card at the start of the
game, reads it, and keeps it secret. When the conditions
on your Hidden Objective card are fulfilled, reveal the
card and remove it from the game.

In a scenario-based game, remove the _Thief_ card from
the game.

#### Heart of the City

You can only use this expansion when playing in
campaign mode. Add the large angel statue miniature, 5
cards, and the _Heart of the City_ booklet to the game.

After scavenging (but before Choose Findings), decide if
you also want to visit the heart of the city. If you do so,
draw 1 card from the Heart of the City deck and resolve
it. Then remove that card from the game. When there
are no cards left, the Heart of the City location becomes
unavailable for the rest of the campaign.

#### Orphans of War

Add the 2 orphan miniatures, 3 Orphans cards, 6
Fittings cards, 6 Kid Action cards, 1 Happiness token,
and the _Orphans of War_ booklet (in the _Heart of the City_
booklet) to the game.

```
During setup, draw one of the 3 Orphans of War
cards. Place the corresponding miniatures in the
shelter on any space. Place the Fitting card Kid’s
Room as described on the card. Shuffle the rest of the
new Fittings cards into Fittings deck. Shuffle the Kid
Actions deck and place it next to the board.
```
#### Sewers advanced players

```
Add the 3 miniatures. 8 Sewers Map cards, 6 Room
cards, and 6 Corridors cards.
```
```
During setup, place the 3 decks by the board.
```
```
At the start of any Day actions phase, you may place any
number of characters on the Sewers deck. They cannot
perform any actions during this phase. At the end of the
phase, they begin their exploration.

to the board and place any of the exploring character
miniatures on it on the room marked S. This marks the
location of the whole group (the group cannot split or
backtrack during exploration). Choose any path leading
to an exit on the edge of the card.
Resolve all the letters (draw a card from the Room deck
and resolve the corresponding letter) and numbers
(draw a card from the Corridors deck and resolve the
corresponding number) shown on the chosen path.
```
```
Then draw a new card from the Sewers Map deck and
match it to the card on the table, connecting your exit
path to an extrance on the new card. Move the miniature
to the new card, choose an exit, and resolve the letters
and numbers on the new card.
```
```
At any time, you may forfeit further exploration and
return to the shelter instead of drawing a new card from
the Sewers Map deck. Resolve the Choose Findings
stage, but you cannot add free resources to the FINDINGS
PILE.
```
```
Once you have placed the fourth Sewers Map card on
the table (not counting the Starting Zone ), the exit
leading to one of the 3 locations is marked on the card
in red. First resolve this room in the usual way, then roll
the black die:
1-5: Near location.
6-8: Distant location.
9-10 Far location.
Now you may begin scavenging in this location as you
would in a Scavenging phase. However, ignore all Reality
Impact cards, and halve the number of Exploration cards
in the Unknown deck.
```
###### Thugs and Resources (optional)

```
When you enter the sewers, you may place 0-3 thug
miniatures on the Starting Zone card. The number of
them determines the threat level during your sewer
exploration.
If you forfeit your exploration and return to the shelter,
roll the black die as many times as this threat level:
```
```
Result lower than or equal to threat level: Combat begins
with a number of thugs armed with knives equal to the
threat level. You may try to stop the fight (see 40 ). After
combat, remove the thug miniatures from the card (the
threat level is now 0) and see 33.
```
```
Result 6-8: Add 5 resources (water/wood/components)
to the FINDINGS PILE.
```
```
Result 9-10: Add 10 resources (water/wood/
components) to the FINDINGS PILE.
```
## EXPANSIONS EXPANSIONS


#### TActics advanced players

Add the 4 miniatures, Tactics map, 9 Tactics tokens,
and 20 cards to the game. During setup, divide the
cards into the Rooms and Corridors deck, the Hidings
Space and Open Space deck, and the remaining cards.
Place them next to the board. Place the Tactics map
next to the decks, along with the tokens and miniatures.

Tactics is an alternative way of resolving combat with
residents (soldiers, deserters, rebels, or thugs) during
scavenging. When triggered, lay out the **Tactics map** on
appropriate side: in medium or large locations, use side
A; and in small locations, use side B.

Place 1 **Tactics token** on each space marked with a
single Tactics token icon, and 2 tokens on each space
marked with 2 Tactics token icons.

Determine the number, prowess, and weapons of
**enemies** according to the Residents card. Place the
tokens of the enemies on the **combat chart** on the board.

Roll the black die for each character in the scavenging
group and place them on the Tactics map on the
spaces that match the results (numbers on a black
background).

###### Tactics Turns

**During a turn:**

**1.** Perform 1 action from the Actions cards.
**2.** Check the color of the space you have finished your
    movement on:
**Blue** = draw and resolve a Room and Corridors card.
**Green** = draw and resolve a Hiding Space card.
**Red** = draw and resolve an Open Space card.

On each **hiding space** , black dots dictate the maximum
number of characters that can stand there.

After each turn, pass the roll of leader to the next player.

###### Movement

Movement actions allow a character to move in any
direction along the passages marked on the map.

Special passages and special spaces marked on the map
are described on the Specials cards.

Characters on the same space are a **group** – choose
1 miniature to represent the group and place the
remaining miniatures aside. When a character finishes
a move on a space occupied by another character, they
immediately form a group.

When you start a group move, you may split the group
by moving one or more characters and leaving the rest
behind.

For multiple groups or individual characters, choose
which group or character is moving this turn. You can
choose the same one as many times in a row as desired

###### Tactics Tokens

During a move collect all the Tactics tokens from the
spaces you have moved through and the space you
finished your move. At any time, until you leave this
location, you can discard a Tactics token to:

- re-roll any chosen result (combat die/black die/own/
    enemy’s);
- lower or raise the Wound result of a combat die roll by
    1 (own/enemy’s)

You can discard several tokens at once to trigger these
effects multiple times.

###### Enemies

```
An enemy can appear as a result of a hide test roll,
a noise test roll, or when marking an enemy occurs.
When you start a combat, choose any 1 enemy token on
the combat chart. If there is more than one enemy or
another appears, choose another. If there are no more
tokens on the chart, there are no more enemies.
You can immediately pick up weapons of dead enemies.
To mark an enemy on a particular space (due to a card
effect), place a soldier miniature there.
```
```
When a marked space is within the move range of a
character or group, you may perform the assault or sneak
up actions (see the Actions cards).
At the beginning of each turn roll the black die for each
marked enemy. On a 1-3, unmark that enemy.
If the characters defeat all enemies on the map, all
those characters can continue scavenging (even if they
were moved to the FINDINGS PILE earlier). If this happens,
ignore noise until the end of this Scavenging phase.
```
###### Hide

```
To perform a hide test , roll the black die (the character
group may use their prowess to re-roll).
If the result is equal to or lower than the hide value , the
enemy does not spot you.
If the result is higher than the hide value , the enemy
spots you and combat begins.
```
```
The hide value of a character or group equals the hide
modifier of the action + the blue number on the space
where the character or group finished their move.
```
###### Noise

```
To perform a noise test , roll the black die (the character
group may use their prowess to re-roll).
If the result is equal to or lower than the noise value , the
enemy has heard us – resolve a Noise card.
If the result is higher than the noise value , no enemies
heard us and nothing happens.
```
```
The noise value of a character or group equals the noise
modifier of the action + the red number on the space
where the character or group finished their move.
```
###### Other Rules

```
Prowess: If a group uses their prowess, you must use the
lowest prowess in the group.
```
```
Shooting and raising the alarm: When a character or
enemy uses a firearm, roll the black die. On a 1-5,
activate the Alarm card.
```
```
Fleeing: If you choose to flee from combat, the enemy
performs a backstab then, after you have moved the
fleeing character or group 3 spaces from the combat
space, activate the Alarm card and finish the turn.
```
```
Support: A character or group on an adjacent space to a
space where combat is happening may join the combat
as a free move. Characters can pass weapons between
themselves if they are in the same space.
```
###### Leaving the Tactics Map

```
A character or group landing on an exit space
automatically leaves the map and finishes scavenging.
Place the characters on the FINDINGS PILE.
A character left on the map after tactics mode has
finished may continue scavenging.
If all characters leave, move to the Choose Findings step.
```
#### TActics advanced players

```
Add the 4 miniatures, Tactics map, 9 Tactics tokens,

a move on a space occupied by another character, they
immediately form a group.
When you start a group move, you may split the group
by moving one or more characters and leaving the rest
behind.

For multiple groups or individual characters, choose
which group or character is moving this turn. You can
choose the same one as many times in a row as desired
```
