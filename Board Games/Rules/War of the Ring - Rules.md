# War of the Ring: Beginner's Guide

## Getting Started
1. Choose sides: One player/team is Free Peoples, the other is Shadow.
2. Set up the board: Follow the picture in the rulebook to place all pieces.
3. Grab your dice and cards: Each side has special dice and a deck of cards.

### Quick Setup Tips:
- Use the setup diagram in the rulebook to place pieces quickly.
- Separate and organize pieces by nation before setup to speed up the process.
- Have one player set up the Free Peoples while the other sets up the Shadow forces.

### Want to get Right into the Action?
- Set up the board as if the game has been in progress for 3 turns:
  - Place the Fellowship in Moria
  - Move some Shadow armies into Rohan and Gondor
  - Advance some nations on the political track
- This skips the early setup and gets you right into the action.

## How to Play
1. Roll your dice.
2. Take turns using one die at a time to do things like:
   - Move your armies
   - Get new troops
   - Play a card for its effect
   - Move the Fellowship (Free Peoples only)
   - Hunt for the Ring (Shadow only)
3. When armies fight:
   - Both sides roll dice (max 5)
   - 5 or 6 scores a hit
   - Remove one piece per hit
   - Keep going until someone retreats or is wiped out

### Simplified First Turn:
- For the first turn, skip the Fellowship phase and Hunt allocation.
- Start with rolling action dice and taking actions to get a feel for the game flow.

## How to Win
- Free Peoples: Get the Ring to Mount Doom or defend long enough
- Shadow: Capture enemy strongholds or corrupt the Ring-bearer

### Simplified Victory Conditions:
- For the first game, focus on the military victory conditions only.
- Free Peoples win by controlling 4 Shadow cities/strongholds.
- Shadow wins by controlling 10 Free Peoples cities/strongholds.

## Important Things to Remember
- The Fellowship (with the Ring) moves in secret
- Nations need to be "activated" before they can fight properly
- Cards give you special actions or bonuses in battle

### Focus on Core Mechanics:
- In your first game, focus on moving armies, basic combat, and moving the Fellowship.
- Introduce more complex elements like politics and special abilities in later games.

### Preset Strategy:
- Free Peoples: Focus on defending key strongholds and guiding the Fellowship towards Mordor.
- Shadow: Concentrate on building large armies and conquering Free Peoples' territories.

### Time-Saving Tips:
- Use action tokens or markers to indicate which armies have moved each turn.
- Keep the rulebook open to the combat section for quick reference.

This game has lots of details you'll learn as you play. Don't worry about getting everything perfect the first time. Start playing and have fun!

## Factions/Civilizations
- Free Peoples: Focus on defending key strongholds, activating nations, and guiding the Fellowship. Can win by destroying the Ring or military defense.
- Shadow: Aims to conquer Middle-earth with vast armies while hunting for the Ring. Can win through military conquest or corrupting the Ringbearer.

## Additional Notes
The game features a deep strategic experience with multiple layers of decision-making. The asymmetric nature of the factions and the tension between military conquest and the Ring quest create a rich, thematic gameplay experience that closely follows Tolkien's narrative.

# Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring Board Game- Rules
###### SETUP

**FREE PEOPLES NATIONS SHADOW NATIONS**

**Gondor** dark blue **Sauron** red

**Rohan** dark green **Isengard** yellow
**The North** light blue **Southrons**

**Dwarves** brown **& Easterlings** orange

**Elves** light green

One player is the **Free Peoples** player ( **FP** ); the other is the
**Shadow** player ( **SP** ).

Place all **companion cards** ( _The Ring-bearers, Gandalf the
Grey, Strider, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, Merry,_ and _Pippin_ ) in
the **Guide of the Fellowship** space, with the _Gandalf the Grey_
character card on top. Set aside the cards for _Aragorn – Heir to
Isildur, Gandalf the White,_ and _Gollum_ for later use.

Place the **Ring-bearers figure** on Rivendell. Place all the other
**companion figures** and their counters in the **The Fellowship of
the Ring** box. Set aside the **Gollum figure** for later use

Place the **Fellowship progress counter** ( _Hidden_ side up), and
the **corruption counter,** on Step 0 of the **Fellowship track**.
Place the 3 **Elven ring counters** ( _Ring_ side up) in the FP’s
**Elven rings** space.

Set aside all **Shadow minion cards** ( _Witch-king, Saruman,_
and _the Mouth of Sauron_ ) and the corresponding figures for
later use.

Shuffle the **Free Peoples** and **Shadow event** cards into their
**character** and **strategy** decks and place them facedown on
their spaces on the board.

Put the **standard hunt tiles** (beige) in an opaque container to
form the **hunt pool**. Set aside the **special hunt tiles** (blue and
red) for later use.

The SP takes 7 red **Shadow action dice** and the FP takes 4
blue **Free Peoples action dice**.

Place the **political counter** for each Free Peoples nation on its
starting point on the **political track**. Those of the Elves and all
the Shadow player nations are placed with the _active_ side up.
The rest are placed with the _passive_ side up.

Sort all the plastic figures and set up each nation’s initial
army units according to the rulebook. Put aside any remaining
figures to use as **reinforcements**.

###### THE MAP

**Black borders** on the map cannot be crossed, and if a border
between regions is completely divided by one, those regions
are _never_ considered adjacent.

A **sea or lake** (a blue area surrounded by a black line or bordered
by a white line) is not a region and can never be crossed.

A **free region** is free for a player when it doesn’t contain
an enemy army and/or an enemy-controlled settlement.
A region containing an enemy-controlled stronghold is also
free for a player when the stronghold is besieged by an army
of that player.

###### THE GAME TURN

```
The game is divided into turns , each divided into 6 phases:
```
**1. Recover action dice and draw event cards**
Players recover the action dice they used in the previous turn,
plus any dice added to the action dice pool and minus any
removed from the pool.
Then each player draws 2 cards, one from each of their event
decks.
**2. Fellowship phase**
The FP may **declare** the position of the Fellowship if it is
_hidden_ (it remains _hidden_ ). If the Fellowship is _declared_ in a
city or stronghold of a FP nation, that nation is **activated** (if
the nation is _passive_ on the political track, flip to _active_ ) and
the Ring-bearers may be **healed**.
The FP may also change the Guide of the Fellowship during
this phase.
**3. Hunt allocation**
The SP may place action dice from their dice pool into the
**Hunt box** that they want to devote to the Hunt for the Ring.

```
If 1 or more FP action dice were in the hunt box at the end of
the previous turn, the SP must place a minimum of 1 die.
```
```
The maximum number of dice the SP can place in the hunt
box is equal to the number of companions currently in the
Fellowship (not including the Ring-bearers). The SP may
always place at least 1 die in the hunt box.
Dice in the hunt box are not rolled in the next phase.
```
**4. Action roll
Players roll their action dice.** The SP immediately adds all the
dice that show the **EYE** symbol to the hunt box.
**5. Action resolution**
Starting with the FP, the players alternate actions, each taking
1 action by using up 1 of their available action die results.

```
A player who has fewer unused dice than their opponent can
pass instead of taking an action. A player may also skip an
action and discard a die. If a player runs out of actions, their
opponent takes all their remaining actions one after the other.
```
```
Each time the FP uses an action die to move the Fellowship,
place that die in the hunt box after completing that action (it
is returned to the FP in the first phase of the next turn). All
other used dice are set aside until the next turn.
```
**6. Victory check**
The game ends if either player has achieved the military
victory conditions. If not, a new game turn begins.

###### ACTION DICE

```
The number of action dice rolled by a player in their turn is
their dice pool.
```
```
Both players may add extra dice to their pools when specific
characters enter the game. Players lose the additional die if
the corresponding character is eliminated. When a player gains
or loses an action die, the gain or loss only takes effect in the
first phase of the next turn.
```
###### THE ELVEN RINGS

```
Before taking an action, use an Elven Ring / Flaming Eye to
change an unused action die to any other desired die result
(the FP may not change to a WILL OF THE WEST result), then
proceed to take a regular action (not necessarily choosing the
die just changed).
```
```
A Shadow die changed to an EYE result is placed in the hunt
box (a die already showing an Eye result cannot be changed).
This does not count as an action.
```
```
When the FP uses an Elven Ring, they flip it over to the
Flaming Eye side and give it to the SP. After the SP uses the
counter, it is discarded from play. Only 1 Elven Ring/Flaming
Eye can be used by the same player during a single turn.
```
###### EVENT CARDS

```
Each player has a strategy deck (banner icon: military and
political options) and a character deck (sword icon: the
Fellowship and the actions of companions and minions).
In the first phase of each turn both players draw 1 card from
each of their decks. An event action die result may also be
used to draw 1 card from either deck.
```
```
Players may hold a maximum of 6 cards and must immediately
discard facedown those in excess. If a deck runs out, it is no
longer possible for the player to draw cards from that deck.
```
```
Event cards can be played during the Action Resolution phase:
1 by using an EVENT action die result, or
2 by using an action die result whose icon matches the
symbol on the upper right corner of the card.
```
```
Some cards have a requirement; this must be fully satisfied in
order to play the card. If the effects of a card cannot be fully
applied it can still be played and the effects applied as much
as possible. Event cards are generally discarded once resolved.
```
```
Play on the table : The card’s effects last until a particular
condition is met, or the condition required to play the card
ceases, after which it is immediately discarded. If discarding
it requires the use of an action die, this counts as an action.
```
```
Recruit: The units or leaders are taken from available
reinforcements. These cards may be used even when a nation
is not at war and also allow units to be placed in a stronghold
under siege. Other recruiting restrictions still apply.
```
```
If a card eliminates all the units in an army, all FP leaders
with the army are removed, while any Nazgûl, companions or
minions remain in the region unless otherwise specified.
All event cards can be played as combat cards (bottom text).
This does not require an action; the card is discarded after use.
```
###### ARMIES

```
Army units are either regular or elite. All units in a single region
controlled by the same player (even from different nations)
form an army. An army can consist of a maximum of 10 units,
or 5 units if the army is inside a stronghold under siege.
```
```
At the end of an action, excess units must be immediately
removed by the controlling player (they may re-enter the game
later as reinforcements).
If a region is too crowded, move some or all of the figures to
a free army box and place the corresponding numbered army
counter in the region.
```
###### RECRUITING NEW UNITS

```
Use a MUSTER die result or play an appropriate event card to
recruit new army units and leaders.
Using a single MUSTER die, bring into play:
2 regular units , or
2 leaders / Nazgûl , or
1 regular unit and 1 leader/ Nazgûl , or
1 elite unit.
```
```
New units must belong to a nation at war if brought on by a
MUSTER die result.
```
```
New recruits are taken from reinforcements and are limited to
the figures available. They may only be placed in a town, city
or stronghold of the nation to which the unit belongs.
```
```
Nazgûl are always recruited in Sauron nation strongholds.
```
```
Two figures recruited at once using a MUSTER die must always
be placed in separate settlements.
```
```
Troops cannot be recruited in a settlement occupied by enemy
troops or containing an enemy control marker; or a besieged
stronghold (unless recruiting by event card).
```
```
When using an event card to recruit units, new units do not
have to belong to a nation at war. If the card allows you to
recruit units into a stronghold, they may be recruited even if the
stronghold is under siege. Otherwise, recruiting by event card is
subject to the usual restrictions.
```
###### ARMY MOVEMENT

```
An army can be moved to an adjacent region with an ARMY
or CHARACTER die, or by playing an appropriate event card.
ARMY die: can move 2 different armies.
CHARACTER die: can move a single army containing at
least 1 leader or character.
```
```
No unit can be moved twice by the same action.
Any region entered must be a free region (no enemy army
and/or enemy-controlled settlement), or an enemy-controlled
settlement free of enemy army units. A region with an enemy-
controlled stronghold under siege by your units is considered
free.
A region occupied by enemy units cannot be entered but must
be attacked.
```
```
If a moving army contains units from a nation not yet at war , it
cannot enter a region inside the borders of any other nation.
```
```
If a moving army enters a region occupied by a friendly army,
the 2 armies merge into a single army. An army may be split
by moving part of its units into an adjacent region.
```
```
FP leaders must choose which part of the army to stay with,
but if a CHARACTER die result was used to move, at least 1 FP
leader or character must join the moving units.
If an event card allows armies to move through more than
1 region, they cannot pick up or drop figures along the
way, and they capture an enemy-controlled settlement they
move through. Check stacking limits only after all multiple
movements are complete.
```
###### LEADERS

```
FP leaders cannot move on their own and must always be part
of a friendly army. A FP leader on the board without an army is
immediately removed.
```
```
Any number of FP leaders may be in an army, and they can
lead armies of any FP nation. They are not considered an army
unit, cannot be taken as casualties, and do not add to the
combat strength of an army.
The Nazgûl or Ringwraiths are the SP leaders. All Nazgûl (the
Witch-king is one) do not have to be part of a friendly army
and may move to any region with a single move.
```
```
They are unaffected by an enemy army in the same region.
However, Nazgûl without an army cannot move into a region
with a stronghold controlled by the FP unless it is besieged
by the SP.
```

###### CHARACTERS

FP characters are called **companions** and SP characters are
called **minions**.

Companions are brought into play when they are separated
from the Fellowship. _Aragorn – Heir to Isildur_ and _Gandalf the
White_ are brought into play using a **WILL OF THE WEST** die.

Minions are brought into play using a **MUSTER** die (using the
rules on the appropriate character card).

Characters are moved by a character die result, or sometimes
by event card. A level 0 character cannot be moved, even
when attached to an army or retreating army.

A character die can be used for one of the following:
FP moves _all_ companions not in the Fellowship.
FP moves the Fellowship.
SP moves _all_ Nazgûl and minions.
FP or SP moves an army with a leader or character.

###### MOVING COMPANIONS

Companions may be moved a number of regions
equal to or less than their **level**. A group in the
same region moving to a common destination
uses the _highest_ level (several groups may be made from the
companions in a region, which can then move independently).

Companions are unaffected by enemy armies, but **must stop
when entering a region with a SP stronghold**. They can never
enter or leave a region with a friendly stronghold besieged by
enemy units (except as a result of certain event cards).

###### MOVING MINIONS

_Saruman_ can never leave the Orthanc region.

_The Mouth of Sauron_ moves in the same way as a companion.
Alone, they are unaffected by enemy armies, but cannot enter
or leave a region with a friendly stronghold besieged by an
enemy army.

Any minion without an army cannot move into a region with a
stronghold controlled by the FP unless it is besieged.

###### BATTLES

A single army may attack an enemy army by using an army or
character die, or by playing an appropriate event card.

Only armies belonging to a nation _at war_ can start a battle.

An **ARMY** die—or a **CHARACTER** die if the army contains at least
1 leader or character—can be used to **attack an enemy army**
in an adjacent region, or to **initiate a siege or sortie** against an
enemy army in the same region.

Attacking units do not actually move into the region attacked
until the battle is won (or the defender retreats into a siege).

An _attacking_ army may be split before committing to a battle.
The non-participating **rearguard** (and its leaders/characters)
cannot be targeted, chosen as casualties, or chosen to advance
into a contested region if the battle is won.

###### RESOLVING A BATTLE

Battles are resolved in a series of simultaneous combat
rounds, during each of which both players:

**1** Play a **combat card** (optional)
**2** Roll dice for the **combat roll
3** Roll dice for the **leader re-roll
4** Remove **casualties
5** Choose to **cease the attack** or **retreat**

###### COMBAT CARDS

```
Each player may play 1 event card as a combat card at the
start of each round (they apply only for the current round
unless specified). Cards are discarded when the round is over.
```
```
The attacker declares if they are using a combat card first,
then the defender; and if both are, they are chosen secretly
(with their backs visible) and simultaneously revealed.
```
```
If the card effect timing is uncertain, the card with the lowest
initiative rating (bottom left corner) is applied first, and on a
tie, the defender’s card is applied first.
Some cards have specific requirements (in bold ) that must
be met for the card to be played. Some require the player to
forfeit Leadership , in which case the selected figure(s) do not
count as a leader for that round. You cannot forfeit Leadership
that has already been cancelled.
```
```
If a card grants an additional attack, a leader re-roll is never
applicable; any modifier granted by the opponent’s combat
card does not apply; and casualties are removed immediately
and not influenced by an opponent’s combat card.
```
###### COMBAT ROLLS / LEADERSHIP RE-ROLLS

```
An army’s combat strength determines the number of dice
rolled in the combat roll , and equals the total number of its
army units (regular and elite), up to a maximum of 5 dice.
An army’s Leadership is the maximum number
of dice re-rolled in the leader re-roll , and
equals the number of leaders (or Nazgûl) plus the
Leadership ratings of all participating characters, up to
a maximum of 5 dice.
```
```
Even with combat cards and character special abilities, the
maximum 5 dice may never be exceeded.
```
```
Each combat roll die hits on a 5 or 6. The leader re-roll
allows players to re-roll failed dice results.
```
```
Combat rolls and leader re-rolls can be modified by cards or
special abilities, which are added to the result of each die.
Multiple modifiers are cumulative.
```
```
A roll of 6 is always a hit and 1 is always a miss.
When attacking an enemy defending a region with a city or
fortification , on the first round of combat only the attacker
hits on a roll of 6 or higher.
```
###### REMOVING CASUALTIES

```
The attacker removes casualties first, then the defender.
For each hit scored by your opponent:
Remove 1 regular unit , or
Replace 1 elite unit with 1 regular unit
```
```
For every 2 hits, remove casualties as above, twice, or
remove 1 elite unit. Regular units replacing elite ones can
be taken from previous casualties. If there are no regulars in
casualties or reinforcements, the elite unit is eliminated.
```
```
Eliminated SP units and Nazgûl are placed back with
reinforcements. Eliminated FP units, leaders, and all
characters are permanent casualties.
```
```
If all the army units in a battle are eliminated, all leaders
and characters that were part of that army are also eliminated.
Characters/minions are permanently removed from the game
unless their character card specifies otherwise. Nazgûl can
still re-enter as reinforcements.
```
```
Characters in a region without friendly army units are never
drawn into a battle.
```
###### CEASING THE ATTACK OR RETREATING

```
The attacking player may choose to cease the attack at the
end of each combat round. If they choose to continue, then
the defender has the option to retreat.
```
```
If the attack is ceased, attacking units remain where they
were at the start of the battle.
```
```
If the defender retreats, their entire army must flee to an
adjacent free region. If no such region is available the army
cannot retreat. If the retreating army contains a level 0
character, that character is left behind.
If the defending army is eliminated or retreats, the attacking
army may immediately move all or part of their attacking units
into the region. If that region contains a stronghold containing
enemy units, the stronghold becomes besieged.
```
###### SIEGES

```
When attacking an enemy defending a region with a
stronghold , before every battle round the defender chooses
whether to fight a field battle or retreat into a siege. A field
battle is resolved as a normal battle.
```
```
If the defender retreats into a siege, the attacker may
immediately advance into the region: the stronghold is now
under siege and the battle is over.
```
```
A maximum of 5 army units and any number of leaders are
placed in the appropriate stronghold box. Excess units are
removed and can re-enter the game later as reinforcements.
```
```
During a siege the region around the stronghold is considered
free for the besieging player.
```
```
A siege ends if the attacking army leaves the region, or any
time either army is eliminated. Move any surviving defenders
from the stronghold box back to the region.
```
###### CONDUCTING A SIEGE

```
The troops under siege can only be attacked by an army in the
same region using an action die for a siege battle. The attacker
hits only on a roll of 6 or higher.
```
```
The battle lasts 1 combat round , unless the attacker reduces
one of their participating elite units to a regular unit to extend
it for an additional round. It can be extended repeatedly this way.
```
```
If the battle ends and there are still defending and besieging
units remaining, the defenders are still considered under siege.
```
```
A besieged army may never retreat. A besieging army may move
away, in which case the defenders are no longer besieged.
```
```
An army in an adjacent region can attack an enemy army
besieging a friendly stronghold; the army inside the stronghold
does not participate.
```
```
While a stronghold is under siege, the besieging army can move
new troops into the region via normal movement.
```
###### SORTIE

```
An army inside a stronghold under siege may attack the
besieging army using an action die for a sortie. The besieged
army fights a field battle for at least 1 round, but may
then cease the battle by moving back into the stronghold.
A rearguard may be left in the stronghold. The besieging
defending army may retreat as usual. If the attacking army
wins, it cannot advance outside of the region.
```
###### CAPTURING A SETTLEMENT

```
A settlement is captured when an enemy army enters a region
with a city, town, or unoccupied stronghold; or when all units
```
```
defending a stronghold are eliminated (and the attacker still
has at least one army unit in the region). The capturing player
places a settlement control marker on the region. A captured
city, town or stronghold cannot be used for recruiting troops or
advancing the political track.
If the original owner recaptures the settlement, the control
marker is removed and any victory points lost.
```
###### POLITICS

```
A nation’s political counter must be in the at war box on the
political track for it to be mobilized and ready to fight.
```
```
If a FP’s nation’s counter has its passive (beige) side faceup,
it can never be moved to the at war box. A FP nation’s counter
is turned to the active (blue) side when:
```
- An army containing its units is attacked.
- One of its regions is entered by an enemy army.
- The Fellowship is _declared_ in one of its cities or strongholds.
- A companion capable of activating that nation (see the
    symbol on its card; the FP symbol means _any_ FP nation)
    ends their movement (or enters play) in one of its cities or
    strongholds.

```
The political counter of a nation can be advanced 1 box
towards the at war box by using a MUSTER die result or by
playing an appropriate event card. The political counter of a
nation is also automatically advanced:
```
- Every time an army containing its units is attacked.
- Every time one of its settlements (city, town or stronghold)
    is captured by the opponent.

```
If a nation is not at war, its armies and leaders cannot move
across another nation’s borders (unless retreating, and the next
time they move they must leave the nation); they cannot attack
enemy armies (but may defend); and they cannot be recruited
by a MUSTER die (but may with an event card).
```
```
Companions, minions and Nazgûl are always considered at war.
```
###### WINNING THE GAME

```
If 2 or more victory conditions are achieved on the same turn,
lower-numbered conditions take precedence over higher-
numbered ones.
```
###### RING-BASED VICTORY CONDITIONS

```
Immediately either of these conditions are true, the game ends
without waiting for the Victory Check phase:
1 Corruption of the Ring-bearers: If the Ring-bearers have 12
or more corruption, the SP wins.
2 Destroying the Ring: If the Ring-bearers figure is on the
Crack of Doom step on the Mordor track, and the Ring-
bearers have fewer than 12 corruption points, the FP wins.
```
###### MILITARY VICTORY CONDITIONS

```
During the Victory Check phase, if any of the following
conditions apply, the game ends with a military victory:
3 The Shadow Conquers Middle-earth: If the SP controls FP
settlements worth 10 or more victory points, they win.
4 Sauron is Banished from Middle-earth: If the FP controls
SP settlements worth 4 or more victory points, the FP wins.
```
```
Military victory conditions are based on the control of a
settlement. You control an enemy settlement if it has your
settlement control marker on it. Use victory points markers
and the victory point track to keep count of victory points.
```

###### THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING

**The Ring-bearers figure** (Frodo and Sam) indicates the last known
position of the Fellowship and is placed in the region where it
was last _declared_ or _revealed_. Rules or cards that refer to the
Fellowship’s **current location** refer to the position of this figure.

At the start of the game, it is placed in _Rivendell_.

###### THE GUIDE OF THE FELLOWSHIP

At the start of the game the **Guide of the Fellowship** is _Gandalf the
Grey._ The FP may nominate a new Guide at the end of a _Fellowship_
phase, or when the composition of the Fellowship changes.

The Guide must always be the remaining companion with the
highest level (choose if there is a tie). Place their character card
topmost on the Fellowship deck.

When a companion is guiding the Fellowship, _only_ their **‘Guide:’**
special ability may be used.

If all companions leave the Fellowship, the _Gollum_ card is placed
in the Guide of the Fellowship box and his special abilities as
Guide apply immediately. Gollum then counts as 1 companion,
so the SP may always place at least 1 die in the hunt box during
hunt allocation.

###### THE FELLOWSHIP TRACK

**The Fellowship progress counter** on the Fellowship track shows
how far the Fellowship has travelled from its last known position
and indicates whether it is _hidden_ or _revealed_.

The FP may move the Fellowship—ie, advance the progress
counter 1 step on the Fellowship track—by using a **CHARACTER**
action die, or by playing an appropriate event card.

After each time the counter moves, the SP may **Hunt for the Ring**.

_Every time_ a die is used to move the Fellowship, it is added to the
hunt box _after_ completing the hunt (these dice are returned to the
FP in the first phase of the next turn). However, if the Fellowship
is moved using an event card, the die used to play the card is _not_
added to the hunt box.

The Fellowship’s _actual_ position is revealed only if the FP _declares_
their position, or if a hunt is successful and _reveals_ its position.

###### FELLOWSHIP DECLARES ITS OWN POSITION

**If the Fellowship is** **_hidden_** **, its position can be** **_declared_** **by the FP
during the Fellowship phase.** The FP may immediately move the
Ring-bearers figure a number of regions from its current position
equal to or less than the number indicated by the progress counter
on the Fellowship track. Reset the counter (still _hidden_ side up) to

0. The Fellowship may enter or leave a besieged stronghold freely.

If any abilities and events force the FP to draw a hunt tile, ignore
any **reveal** icon on the tile if the Fellowship has been _declared_ in a
FP stronghold or FP-controlled city.

###### REVEALED BY A HUNT FOR THE RING

**If the Fellowship is** **_hidden_** **, its position can be** **_revealed_** **by the SP
as a result of a successful hunt, or by certain event cards.**

Turn the progress counter to its **revealed** side and move the
Ring-bearers figure and reset the progress counter as above. This
movement can _never_ end in a region with a FP stronghold or city
controlled by the FP.

```
When the Fellowship is revealed by the SP and its path traced from
its last known position, if it has moved through, is moving from, or
has moved into a SP stronghold still controlled by the SP, then a
hunt tile is immediately drawn for each stronghold involved, as if a
hunt has been successful.
Multiple hunt tiles are resolved one at a time in this order: the tile
that caused the Fellowship to be revealed, then those related to
events and abilities, then one drawn due to the SP stronghold.
```
###### HIDING THE FELLOWSHIP

```
The FP cannot move the Fellowship until it is hidden again. Turn the
progress counter to its hidden side by using a CHARACTER action die
or by playing an appropriate event card. The Fellowship cannot also
move during that action; do not add the used die to the hunt box.
```
###### HEALING

```
If during the Fellowship phase the Fellowship is declared in
a region with a FP city or stronghold not under enemy control,
1 point of corruption is immediately removed (to a minimum of 0).
If they remain they may declare each turn and heal each turn.
```
###### SEPARATING COMPANIONS

```
The FP can separate 1 companion or group of companions by using
a CHARACTER action die (unless the Fellowship is on the Mordor
track). Separated companions can never rejoin the Fellowship.
```
```
When a companion leaves the Fellowship, their figure is moved to
the map, their counter removed from the Fellowship of the Ring
box, and their character card placed in front of the FP.
A separated companion may immediately move a number of
regions equal to the current number of the progress counter plus
their companion level (use the highest level in a group). If the
Ring-bearers are in a FP-controlled stronghold under siege, the
companion(s) cannot leave the stronghold.
```
###### THE HUNT FOR THE RING

```
Every time the FP moves the Fellowship, the SP determines the
hunt level (the total number of Shadow action dice in the hunt
box), then must make a hunt roll by rolling that number of combat
dice (maximum 5 dice).
```
```
For every action die the FP has placed in the hunt box (after each
Fellowship movement), the SP adds +1 to each hunt roll result.
```
```
At least one result of 6 or higher is a success. A roll of 1 is always
a failure, regardless of modifiers.
```
```
If the Ring-bearers are in a region that contains a SP-controlled
stronghold, one or more SP army units, or 1 or more Nazgûl, the
SP can re-roll 1 failed hunt die for each of these conditions that
apply. Re-rolls also receive the +1 bonus for each FP die in the
hunt box.
```
###### HUNT DAMAGE

```
If the SP rolls at least 1 success the hunt is successful and the SP
randomly draws 1 tile from the hunt pool:
```
```
Number The amount of hunt damage.
EYE Hunt damage equals the number of successes in the hunt
roll. The damage is 0 if the tile was drawn due to an event card, or
because of the Fellowship entering or leaving a Shadow stronghold.
REVEAL The Fellowship is revealed after resolving any other effect.
```
###### EFFECTS OF THE HUNT

```
To deal with the effects of the hunt, the FP may use 1 relevant
‘Play on the Table’ event card to cancel or reduce the damage,
then they may use the Guide’s special ability.
```
```
If the damage is still 1 or more, they may take a casualty.
If they take a casualty, the FP may eliminate the Guide, or the
SP randomly picks a facedown companion counter (excluding the
Ring-bearers, but including the Guide) from the Fellowship box,
and that companion is eliminated.
```
```
If the hunt damage is higher than the level of the eliminated
companion or Guide, the excess damage is taken as corruption.
```
```
Remaining damage must be dealt with by using the Ring :
advance the corruption counter by a number of steps equal to the
remaining hunt damage.
```
```
If at any time a new Guide is appointed, the new Guide’s ability
may be used immediately, if applicable.
```
###### MORDOR AND MOUNT DOOM

```
When the Fellowship is in Morannon or Minas Morgul during a
Fellowship phase , the FP may decide to enter Mordor.
```
```
Place the Ring-bearers figure on the first step of the Mordor track :
from now on it is considered on the Mordor track (the track is not
considered part of the Gorgoroth region).
```
```
The progress counter is no longer advanced, but is still used to
show whether the Fellowship is hidden or revealed.
```
```
Create a new hunt pool by placing all previously drawn Eye tiles
back with the remaining tiles of the hunt pool, and adding any
special tiles (blue or red background) put in play by event cards.
Do not add any tile that was permanently removed from the game.
```
###### ON THE MORDOR TRACK

```
Companions in the Fellowship can never be separated; any action
that would do so eliminates the companion instead.
```
```
When the FP tries to move the Fellowship during the Action
Resolution phase, do not roll the hunt dice. Instead, automatically
draw 1 tile from the hunt pool.
```
```
Apply effects as for a successful hunt, except for:
```
```
EYE The hunt damage is equal to the number of dice in the hunt
box (including FP dice previously used for moving the Fellowship
during the same turn). There is no maximum damage.
```
```
STOP The Fellowship remains on the same step and does not
move forward.
```
```
The Fellowship is still required to be hidden in order to advance.
```
```
If revealed , the FP must, as normal, use a CHARACTER action die to
hide the Fellowship again.
```
```
If, at the end of the Action Resolution phase, the FP has not
attempted to move or hide the Fellowship on the Mordor track
during that turn, 1 corruption is added to the Ring-bearers.
```
###### REACHING MOUNT DOOM

```
If the Fellowship completes all 5 steps on the Mordor track
(and the Ring-bearers have less than 12 corruption points),
the FP wins the game.
```

#### movement

**ARMIES**

Move to an adjacent region free of
enemy armies and/or an enemy-controlled
settlement not under siege.

Units not _at war_ cannot cross another
nation’s borders.

No unit can be moved twice by the
same action.

**STACKING**
Stacking limit is **10 army units**. Stacking
limit in a stronghold is 5 army units.

Leaders, Nazgûl, companions, minions,
and the Fellowship do not count.

**FP LEADERS**

FP leaders cannot move on their own and
must always be part of a friendly army.

**SP LEADERS (NAZGˆUL)**

All Nazgûl (including the _Witch-king_ ) do
not have to be part of an army and may
move to _any_ region with a single move.

They are unaffected by an enemy army
in the same region. Alone, they may not
enter a region containing a FP-controlled
stronghold unless it is being besieged by
a SP army.

**FP CHARACTERS
(COMPANIONS)**
All companions may move a number of
regions equal to or less than their **level**.
A group uses the _highest_ level.

They are unaffected by enemy armies,
but must stop when entering a region
with a SP stronghold. They cannot enter
or leave a region with a besieged friendly
stronghold.

When **separating from the Fellowship**
(cannot in _Mordor_ ), move a number of
regions equal to level _plus_ the current
number of the Progress counter.

**SP CHARACTERS
(MINIONS)**

Any minion without an army cannot move
into a region with a stronghold controlled
by the FP unless it is besieged.

_Saruman_ cannot leave Orthanc.

_The Mouth of Sauron_ moves in the same
way as a companion. Alone, they are
unaffected by enemy armies, but cannot
enter or leave a region with a friendly
stronghold besieged by an enemy army.

```
```
Otherwise, combat ends.
```
```
SORTIE
An army inside a stronghold under siege
may attack the besieging army using an
action die for a sortie.

army enters a region with a city, town, or
unoccupied stronghold; or when all units
defending a stronghold are eliminated
(and the attacker still has at least one
army unit in the region).

Stacking limit is 10 army units. Stacking
limit in a stronghold is 5 army units.
```
```
Leaders, Nazgûl, companions, minions,
and the Fellowship do not count.
```
```
FP LEADERS
FP leaders cannot move on their own and
must always be part of a friendly army.
```
```
SP LEADERS (NAZGˆUL)
All Nazgûl (including the Witch-king ) do
not have to be part of an army and may
move to any region with a single move.
```
```
They are unaffected by an enemy army
in the same region. Alone, they may not
enter a region containing a FP-controlled
stronghold unless it is being besieged by
a SP army.
```
```
FP CHARACTERS
(COMPANIONS)
All companions may move a number of
regions equal to or less than their level.
A group uses the highest level.
```
```
They are unaffected by enemy armies,
but must stop when entering a region
with a SP stronghold. They cannot enter
or leave a region with a besieged friendly
stronghold.
```
```
When separating from the Fellowship
(cannot in Mordor ), move a number of
regions equal to level plus the current
number of the Progress counter.
```
```
SP CHARACTERS
(MINIONS)
Any minion without an army cannot move
into a region with a stronghold controlled
by the FP unless it is besieged.
Saruman cannot leave Orthanc.
```
```
The Mouth of Sauron moves in the
same way as a companion. Alone, he is
unaffected by enemy armies, but cannot
enter or leave a region with a friendly
stronghold besieged by an enemy army.
```
#### field battles

```
Only units belonging to a nation at war
can start a battle.

CASUALTIES
One hit eliminates 1 regular unit, or
replaces 1 elite unit with 1 regular unit

the attacker may immediately move into
the region and besiege the stronghold.
```
```
The combat then ends.

END OF COMBAT ROUND
A besieged army may never retreat.
```
```
The attacker may reduce one of their
participating elite units to regular status
to extend the battle for another round (it
can be extended repeatedly this way).
```
```
Otherwise, combat ends.
```
```
SORTIE
An army inside a stronghold under siege
may attack the besieging army using an
action die for a sortie.
```
```
The besieged army fights a field battle for
at least 1 round, but may cease the battle
by moving back into the stronghold.
```
```
A rearguard may be left in the stronghold.
The besieging defending army may retreat
as usual. If the attacking army wins, they
cannot advance outside of the region.
```
```
CAPTURING A SETTLEMENT
A settlement is captured when an enemy
army enters a region with a city, town, or
unoccupied stronghold; or when all units
defending a stronghold are eliminated
(and the attacker still has at least one
army unit in the region).
```
```
Place a settlement control marker on the
region.
```
```
A captured city, town or stronghold cannot

**HEALING**

If the Fellowship is _declared_ in a region
with a FP stronghold (even under siege)
or city not under SP control, **heal 1 point
of corruption.**

###### DECLARING

**The FP may only** **_declare_** **the Fellowship

Move the Fellowship figure and reset the
progress counter ( _hidden_ side up) to 0.

If the FP is forced to draw a hunt tile,
ignore any _reveal_ icon if the Fellowship
has been _declared_ in a FP stronghold or
FP-controlled city.

###### REVEALING

**The FP may be** **_revealed_** **by the SP if it
is** **_hidden._**

Move the Fellowship figure and reset the
progress counter ( _revealed_ side up) to 0.

The move can _never_ end in a region with
a FP stronghold or FP-controlled city.

When the Fellowship is _revealed_ by the
SP and its path traced from its last known
position, if it has _moved through, is
moving from, or has moved into_ a Shadow
stronghold still controlled by the SP, then
**a hunt tile is immediately drawn** for _each_
stronghold involved, as if a hunt has been
successful.

**MERRY & PIPPIN**

Once separated as a result of using their
Guide ability, _Merry_ and _Pippin_ follow the
normal rules for separating companions.

Either or both can separate as a result
of 1 hunt tile. If both are separated as a
result of the same tile they must move
as a group.

Their Guide ability can be used on the
Mordor track, but they are eliminated as
soon as they separate.

If they use their Guide ability when a
Hunt tile with a **reveal** icon is drawn,
they are separated from the Fellowship
before it is _revealed_ and moved.

###### SETUP

Either _Strider_ or _Gandalf the Grey_ (either version) may be chosen
as the starting Guide of the Fellowship. If _Gandalf the Grey,
Keeper of Narya_ is the Guide, add his **NARYA** die to the FP’s action
die pool in turn one. If Gandalf is _not_ the Guide, do not reveal
which version you have chosen to the SP.

Replace the Elven Ring counters with the new counters. Replace
the _Balrog of Moria_ card with the _A Balrog is Come!_ card. Add the
remaining 12 new cards to the appropriate decks. Place 2 of the 4
**Sméagol tiles** in the hunt pool.

**Unconquered** indicates a settlement controlled by the player who
controlled it at the start of the game. A settlement recaptured by
its original owner is _unconquered_ again. A stronghold under siege
is _unconquered_ if the besieged army belongs to the original owner.
Companions and minions can be recruited in an unconquered
stronghold, as noted on their cards.

**Non-flying minions** _(The Balrog, Gothmog,_ and the _Mouth of Sauron)_
move, without an army, a number of regions up to their level, and
are unaffected by enemy armies. They cannot cross impassable
terrain, or enter or leave a region containing a stronghold besieged
by an enemy army. Without an army, they cannot be moved into a
FP-controlled stronghold, unless it is besieged by a SP army.

###### SPECIAL DICE

**Special dice** are rolled with the standard action dice. **If you roll
multiple special dice you must choose one of the rolled results and
discard the others for this turn**. The selected die is used as normal
and is counted as part of the action dice pool for the purposes of
deciding which player has more dice.

If both players have to choose, the player who rolled the highest
total number of dice chooses first (on a tie, the FP chooses first).

If 1 or more of the results is an **EYE** , the choice must be an **EYE**.
If more than 1 is rolled, you may choose which **EYE** die to use.

Dice not chosen are recovered during the _Recover Action Dice_
phase of the following turn, together with the unused dice.
A special action die is removed in this phase if the character
associated with it was eliminated in the previous turn.

```
Card draw
You may draw 1 event card from either
one of your event decks.
```
(^)
**Remove symbol ( )**
Under the appropriate conditions, the die is
permanently removed from the game after use.

###### FP KEEPER DICE

When either _Lord Elrond_ or _Lady Galadriel_ is in play, that
character’s die is added to the FP’s dice pool at the start of the
turn after either character enters play.

_Gandalf the Grey, Keeper of Narya’s_ die is added to the FP’s dice
pool if, during the _Recover Action Dice_ phase, he is the Guide, and
the FP recovered at least 1 FP action die from the hunt box (ie, the
Fellowship moved at least once using a character result last turn).

During the _Recover Action Dice_ phase, both used and unused
**KEEPER** dice in play are recovered. Rules that apply to the recovery
of FP dice from the hunt box do not apply if the die is a **KEEPER’S**
die that rolled an **EYE** result.

```
If Gandalf the White is in play when recovering action dice, eliminate
the previous turn’s chosen KEEPER die if its result has a symbol.
```
###### SP LESSER MINION DICE

```
When either The Balrog or Gothmog is in play, that character’s die
is added to the SP’s dice pool at the start of the turn after either
character enters play.
```
```
During the Recover Action Dice phase, both used and unused
LESSER MINION dice in play are recovered.
```
```
If the Witch-King (any version) is in play when recovering action
dice, eliminate the previous turn’s chosen LESSER MINION die if its
result has a symbol.
```
###### THE ELVEN RINGS

```
Each Elven Ring can be used as in the standard rules (choose a
specific token as that Ring’s special ability will not be available
later), or to activate an individual special Ring ability.
```
```
The use of a Ring is available whether the depicted character is in
play or not. Its special ability is only available when its associated
character is in play. The use of a Ring to activate its special ability
is in addition to the limit of 1 normal Ring use per turn. When
used, it is flipped over and given to the SP.
```
```
An Elven Ring cannot be used to change the result of a KEEPER die
or a LESSER MINION die.
```
```
If the FP player plays a Three Rings for the Elven-Kings event
card, they may recover a Ring of their choice they used previously;
first choosing from among Rings out of the game, then from Rings
owned by the SP. If the depicted character is still in play, the
Ring’s special ability becomes available again.
```
###### CHARACTER NOTES

```
SMÉAGOL
When a Sméagol tile is drawn from the hunt pool,
the hunt damage is 0 and Sméagol immediately
enters play as a special companion, always as the
Guide. Remove the drawn tile from the game and add
his companion card and counter.
```
```
Sméagol is not Gollum , and is not played if Gollum enters play
before him (discard the tile and draw another).
```
```
Sméagol adds 1 to the number of companions for the purposes of
the number of action dice that the SP may place in the hunt box,
and he may be taken as a hunt casualty as normal.
His level (X) is equal to the highest level companion in the
Fellowship. He may not be used as an army leader. He is discarded
if he is separated from the Fellowship or the Fellowship is declared
in an unconquered FP city or stronghold.
```
```
If Sméagol is eliminated or discarded, the SP event card We Shall
Get It immediately enters play. If he is ever the only companion in
the Fellowship, replace him with Gollum (the We Shall Get It card
does not enter play in this instance).
```
```
If a Sméagol tile is drawn after he leaves the game, discard it and
draw another. If he is no longer in play, Gollum can enter play
normally.
```
```
While Sméagol is the Guide, if a Sméagol Hunt tile is drawn, the
hunt damage is 0 and the tile is removed from the game.
```
```
THE BALROG
When the Balrog enters play, it is inactive : level 0 and unable to
leave Moria. Place the Balrog status counter on its Inactive side.
If the SP rolls and chooses the USE BALROG result of the
Balrog’s LESSER MINION die, or the A Balrog is Come! event
card is played, it becomes active : level 2 and able to leave
Moria as a non-flying minion. Flip the counter to active.
```
```
If the Balrog is already active, a new USE BALROG result may be
used to perform 1 of these actions: move an army with the Balrog ,
or attack with an army with the Balrog , or move the Balrog only.
The Balrog remains active until the FP player makes it inactive
by using a WILL OF THE WEST die result, or by using a CHARACTER
action die result if Gandalf (any version) is in the same region.
```
```
The Balrog is eliminated if it is made inactive when not in Moria.
If in Moria, its level reverts to 0: flip the counter to Inactive.
```
```
Fire and shadow When a hunt tile is drawn when the Fellowship is
in the same region as the Balrog , if Gollum is the Guide, discard
the tile without effect.
```
```
THE MOUTH OF SAURON, BLACK NÚMENÓREAN
The Mouth of Sauron, Black Númenórean adds 1 standard action
die to the SP action dice pool.
The SP may recruit this version instead of The Mouth of Sauron,
Lieutenant of Barad-dûr , when the Fellowship is on the Mordor
track. Either version cannot be played if the other version is in play
or was previously eliminated.
```
```
THE WITCH-KING, CHIEF OF THE RINGWRAITHS
The Witch-king, Chief of the Ringwraiths adds 1 standard action
die to the SP action dice pool.
All event and combat cards referring to the Witch-king can be used
for either version. The Witch-king may be replaced by an alternate
version only once per game, and he may not be replaced if he was
eliminated previously.
```
```
Spear of terror If the SP event card Palantir of Orthanc is also in
play, only 1 card is drawn, not 2.
```
###### COUNCIL OF RIVENDELL (OPTIONAL)

```
The FP secretly replaces any or all of the Fellowship characters
with the matching character from this expansion.
The Guide is always visible; any other character must be revealed
if they become the Guide, they are selected as a hunt casualty, or
they are separated from the Fellowship.
During the Fellowship phase of the first turn, the FP may declare
one or more companions that are able to do so to be outside the
Fellowship. Place them in their starting locations and treat them
as any companion who separated from the Fellowship.
```
```
If any companions start outside the Fellowship, the SP receives
1 action token of their choice if there is only one; and both tokens
if there is more than one. The SP may choose from a Move Nazgûl
and Minions token or a Advance a Shadow Nation on the Political
Track token. Each may be used, once during the game and only 1
token per turn, in place of using an action die result (and not as an
‘any Action die result’).
Action tokens are not counted among the number of actions
available to the SP when deciding if they can pass an action.

###### SETUP

_Warriors of Middle-Earth_ may be played with the base game alone,
or together with _Lords of Middle-Earth_.

If you use the **Treebeard** promotional figure, replace its character
card with the _Treebeard_ card in this expansion.

Remove _Gwaihir the Windlord, The Eagles are Coming!, The Ents
Awake: Treebeard, The Ents Awake: Huorns, The Ents Awake:
Entmoot,_ and _Dead Men of Dunharrow_ from the **FP character deck**_._

Remove _Corsairs of Umbar_ and _Rage of the Dunlendings_ from the
**SP strategy deck**_._ Remove _Shelob’s Lair_ from the **SP character deck**_._

Add the new event cards to the appropriate event decks.

Each player shuffles their new **faction event deck** and sets it
beside their other event decks. Set aside the **faction dice** , **figures**
and the **call to battle cards.**

Each player places the 3 **faction reference cards** of their faction on
the table, image side up. Each player also takes a **faction action
dice reference sheet**.

**Unconquered** indicates a settlement controlled by the player who
controlled it at the start of the game. A settlement recaptured by
its original owner is _unconquered_ again. A stronghold under siege
is _unconquered_ if the besieged army belongs to the original owner.
Companions and minions can be recruited in an unconquered
stronghold, as noted on their cards.

###### THE FACTIONS

Each player has a third event deck: the **faction** deck.

**Each player draws 1 faction card from their faction deck at the
beginning of each turn** , including the first.

Faction cards are not counted against the hand limit of 6. **You may
have a maximum of 4 faction cards in your hand**. Excess cards
must be immediately discarded to the discard pile.

Generally, a faction card is subject to the same rules and effects
as an event card, and the faction deck is subject to the same rules
and effects as any other event deck. However abilities referring to
cards from a specific deck do not apply to faction cards.

Faction decks are reshuffled when they run out of cards.

**A normal EVENT action die result can be used to draw from the
faction deck or play any faction card**.

The appropriate action die result indicated on each card
( **CHARACTER** , **ARMY** , **MUSTER** ) can also be used to play a faction card.

**Faction recruitment cards**
If you play a faction card on a faction not yet in play, the card has
no effect, unless it allows you to _add figures to the starting setup_.
In this case, place the recruited figures on the faction card. They
will enter the game when the faction is brought in play (together
with the figures indicated in the setup of that faction) in any
starting region of that faction.

A faction card played on a faction that has been eliminated from
play has no effect.

If the card allows you to place figures on the card then recruit
them, the figures are not considered in play and are returned to
the reinforcement pool if the card is discarded for any reason.

```
Faction dice
When your first faction enters play, add the FACTION die to your
action dice pool at the beginning of the following turn.
```
```
If you have no more factions in play, remove the FACTION die from
your action dice pool at the beginning of the following turn. The
die may be recovered if a new faction belonging to you enters play.
```
```
Use of a FACTION die requires an action, and it counts as a normal
action die only for the purpose of the pass rule. It is not a normal
action die for any other purpose, unless otherwise stated. The die
results can only be used on faction cards and figures.
```
```
If more than 1 faction is in play, choose the faction affected by the
action allowed by the die.
```
```
Bringing factions into play
When the specific condition required to bring a faction into play is
fulfilled, a normal action die MUSTER result (or FACTION die RECRUIT
FACTION result) can be used to do so.
```
```
When a faction enters play, flip its reference sheet to show its rules
summary. Then place its starting figures. Additional figures may be
available if you play certain faction cards.
```
```
Faction figures
Faction figures are not army units, have no combat strength,
cannot be attacked by enemy units, do not affect enemy
movement, and do not count for stacking, unless otherwise
specified by their rules and/or events.
```
```
Unless otherwise indicated, they are unaffected by the presence of
a friendly army in the same region. Their presence in a region does
not give control of the region to the player, and does not affect the
political track.
```
```
The maximum number of figures of a faction in play is limited by
those available. Eliminated FP faction figures are out of the game.
SP faction figures are returned to the reinforcement pool when
eliminated.
```
```
Factions in battle
You may call to battle figures of a faction in play, using the effect
of your call to battle cards.
```
```
Each player may receive up to 6 call to battle cards before a
battle: 2 cards (1 CHARACTER call to battle card and 1 STRATEGY
call to battle card) for each faction in play that satisfies the
requisite conditions to be called to that battle. Add these cards to
your hand at the start of the battle.
```
```
Even if marked with a character symbol or strategy symbol on the
back to conceal their identity, call to battle cards do not belong to
the character deck or strategy deck. Therefore the Witch–King’s
Sorcerer ability does not apply to call to battle cards.
```
```
At the start of each round, each player may choose to play one of
these cards instead of playing an event card from their hand for its
combat card effect.
```
```
Call to battle cards can be reused as long as the necessary
requirements to play them are fulfilled, and they are taken back by
the players at the end of each round.
```
```
Whenever you are prevented from playing a combat card, you are
prevented from playing call to battle cards as well. Cards that
cancel the effects of a combat card also cancel the effects of a
call to battle card.
```
```
Discard the call to battle cards from your hand at the end of the
battle, and set them aside for later use.
```
###### MULTI-PLAYER GAMES

```
Each player in a team has a limit of 3 faction cards in hand,
instead of 4.
```
```
Only the leading player in a team draws a faction card at the
beginning of a turn. The leading player may then decide to give 1
faction card to their teammate.
```
```
Either player in a team may use the FACTION die (at any time they
could use a normal action die).
```
```
Either player in a team may spend an action die to play faction
cards from their own hand.
```
```
Either player in a team may call to battle a faction in a battle
involving an army they control.
```
```
A player may use a faction card for any faction, regardless of
which nations they control. However, a player may only play a
faction card referring to a Shadow Army to use an army they
control.

###### THE DEAD MEN OF DUNHARROW

###### CONDITION TO ENTER PLAY

When _Strider_ / _Aragorn_ is in, or within 1 region from, Erech; including
regions across the mountains (Helm’s Deep, Westemnet, Edoras).

When this faction enters play, immediately move _Strider/Aragorn_
(and any number of companions in the same region, even if they are
in a stronghold under siege) to Erech, to join the Army of the Dead.
companions may only join the Army of the Dead when it enters play.

###### STARTING SETUP AND RECRUITMENT

**Enter play:** 2 Dead Men in Erech.

**Recruit faction action:** 1 Dead Men in the Army of the Dead.

###### STACKING LIMIT: NONE

###### RESTRICTIONS

Dead Men are always together in 1 region (initially, Erech), forming
the Army of the Dead. The Army of the Dead is not considered a
FP army for any purpose.

When _Strider/Aragorn_ , and any companions with him, are with the
Army of the Dead, they are not considered to be with a FP army in
the same region. Companions may only leave the Army of the Dead
when _Strider/Aragorn_ does.

###### USING THE DEAD MEN

The Army of the Dead can move and attack when the FP plays a
_Wraiths of Fear_ faction card.

**Movement**
The Army of the Dead can move more than once in the same
action, each time to an adjacent region, as long as you eliminate 1
figure from the Army of the Dead each time it is moved. The region
must be free of enemy units. You can repeat this process as long
as there is more than 1 Dead Men figure in the Army of the Dead.

**Attack**
After the Army of the Dead ends its movement, you can use it to
attack a SP army in an adjacent region.

**Eliminate 1 Dead Men figure from the Army of the Dead, then roll
3 dice, scoring hits on rolls of 4+**.

You can repeat this process, removing an additional figure to
attack the same SP army again, as long as there are Dead Men in
the Army.

The attack is not a normal battle: the SP cannot respond to the
attack in any way, no call to battle or combat cards are played by
either player, and no terrain features affect the roll.

If the attack eliminates all units in the SP army, any Nazgûl or
minions with that army are also eliminated.

When the attack ends, any surviving units in the attacked SP
army must retreat together to an adjacent region (different from
the one the attack came from) following the normal retreat rules.
If the SP army cannot retreat (because it is under siege, or there
is no available region) it does not. Any minions or Nazgûl in the
retreating army may remain with it or be left behind (SP’s choice).

If the attacked SP army is either eliminated or retreats, the Army
of the Dead may then advance into the now empty region (without
removing 1 Dead Men figure).

```
As the SP may move their armies into the region containing the
Army of the Dead, the Army of the Dead can be in the same region
as a SP army. The FP can attack such an army normally with the
Dead Men, as if the region was adjacent to the Army of the Dead;
or they can choose to ignore the SP army and move the Army of
the Dead out of the region.
```
###### CALL TO BATTLE

```
If the Army of the Dead is in the same region as, or in a region
adjacent to, the defending army, the FP may call to battle the
Dead Men, instead of using a combat card.
```
###### ELIMINATION

```
If, at any moment, there are no more Dead Men in the Army of the
Dead, the Dead Men faction is immediately out of the game.
```
```
The FP may declare that Strider/Aragorn , and any companions
with him, leaves the Army of the Dead. The Army of the Dead is
immediately disbanded and the faction is out of the game.
```
###### THE EAGLES OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS

###### CONDITION TO ENTER PLAY

```
When the Fellowship’s last known position is not in Rivendell, or
Gandalf the White is in play.
```
###### STARTING SETUP AND RECRUITMENT

```
Enter play: 2 Eagles in Eagles’ Eyrie.
Recruit faction action: 1 Eagle in Eagles’ Eyrie.
```
###### STACKING LIMIT: NONE

###### USING THE EAGLES

```
Movement
When the effect specifies move all Eagles , the FP may move each
Eagle in play to any region on the board, without restrictions.
```
###### CALL TO BATTLE

```
If there are 1 or more Eagles within a distance of 4 regions from
the defending army (ignore any limitation for mountain borders),
the FP may call to battle the Eagles, instead of using a combat
card. Move some or all of the Eagles within range to the region
with the battle.
```
###### ELIMINATION

```
If, at any moment, there are no Eagles in play, the Eagle faction is
immediately out of the game.
```
###### THE ENTS OF FANGORN

###### CONDITION TO ENTER PLAY

```
When Saruman is in play, and a companion or the Fellowship is
in Fangorn.
```
###### STARTING SETUP AND RECRUITMENT

```
Enter play: 2 Ent figures in Fangorn, to form the Entwood.
Recruit faction action: 1 Ent in the Entwood.
```
###### STACKING LIMIT: NONE

###### RESTRICTIONS

```
At least 1 Ent must always be in Fangorn, together with a
companion or the Fellowship, to form the Entwood.
```
###### USING THE ENTS

```
Ents can move and attack when the FP plays a March of the Ents
faction card.
The March of the Ents
The FP can use Ent figures in the Entwood to move or attack,
one or more times during the same action. A series of movements
and attacks can be made during the same action, in any desired
order, as long as there are Ent figures to take or eliminate from
the Entwood.
Movement
Take 1 Ent figure from the Entwood and place it in a region
adjacent to a region already containing an Ent. The region must be
free of enemy units. You can repeat this process as long as there
is more than 1 Ent figure in the Entwood. The Ents will form an
uninterrupted chain originating from and including the Entwood.
Attack
You can attack a SP army in a region adjacent to an Ent.
```
```
Eliminate 1 Ent figure from the Entwood, then roll 3 dice, scoring
hits on rolls of 4+.
```
```
You can repeat this process as long as there are Ents in the Entwood.
```
```
The attack is not a normal battle: the SP cannot respond to the
attack in any way, no call to battle or combat cards are played by
either player, and no terrain features affect the roll.
```
```
If the attack eliminates all units in the SP army, any Nazgûl or
minions with that army are also eliminated.
```
```
As the SP may move their armies into a region containing Ents,
an Ent figure can be in the same region as a SP army. The FP can
attack such an army normally with the Ents, as if the region was
adjacent to an Ent.
```
```
If an Ent attack eliminates all SP units in Orthanc, or if Orthanc is
free of enemy units and an Ent is moved there, eliminate Saruman.
```
###### CALL TO BATTLE

```
If an Ent figure is in the same region as, or in a region adjacent
to, the defending army, you may call to battle the Ents, instead of
using a combat card.
```
###### ELIMINATION

```
If, at any moment, there are no Ent figures in the Entwood (or
if there is no companion or the Fellowship in Fangorn), the Ent
faction is immediately out of the game.

Corsairs are not SP army units, but they may move together with a
SP army in the same region when that army moves.

When they move (alone, using a faction card, or with a SP army)
they are limited to moving to:

- coastal regions on the Western Sea;
- any Gondor region except Erech;
- Osgiliath.

If a SP army including Corsairs moves to any other region, Corsairs
must be left behind.

Corsairs in a region with a SP army advancing or retreating after
combat may move with the army, as long as the region is one they
are allowed to move into; otherwise, they must be left behind.

If Corsairs are in the same region as a besieged SP army, they are
never considered to be inside the besieged stronghold.

###### USING CORSAIRS

Corsairs _can_ move when you play _A Great Fleet_ , and they can
transport SP army units when you play _Ships of Great Draught_.

**Movement**
Whenever Corsairs are moved, you can move them up to 4 regions

in a free region, or an unoccupied enemy–controlled settlement.

**Transporting an army to attack**

transported to attack. **Each Corsairs figure may transport up to
2 SP units and any number of minions or Nazgûl to attack**.

(within normal army and Corsair restrictions), then attack into an
adjacent region (or a besieged enemy–controlled stronghold in the
same region).

If there is a SP army in the destination region, the transported
army may merge with that army (check the stacking limit) before
attacking.

###### CALL TO BATTLE

```
If there are 1 or more Corsairs in the same region as the SP
army, and the SP army is not under siege, you may call to battle
Corsairs, instead of using a combat card.
If new SP units are moved into the battle by the Borne up on
the Wind call to battle card, they are added to the SP army after
casualties are applied, but before the end of the round. They
cannot be used to absorb casualties from the current round;
however, if all units in the army were eliminated, the battle may
continue, and any minions or Nazgûl in the army are not eliminated.
