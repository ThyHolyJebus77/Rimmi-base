# Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth - Rules

## FIRST CAMPAIGN SETUP

Select the **New Game** button on the app’s title screen
and follow the screens for selecting a campaign, a
difficulty, and a save slot.

Each player selects a **hero** in the app to use for the
campaign, then takes their hero’s **figure** and **hero card**.
If playing solo, choose 2 heroes and control both.

Each player selects their **starting items** , takes the item
cards that match the name and tier displayed in the app,
and places them near their hero card.

Shuffle the **damage cards** , **fear cards** , and **weakness skill
cards** (not the other skill cards) into separate decks.

Separate the **exploration/inspiration** , **search/ threat** ,
**person** , and **enemy banner tokens** , plus the 3 types of
**boon cards** , into separate piles to create the supply.

Input a group name in the app, then select **Begin** and
watch the cutscene.

Each player selects a **role** in the app for the first
adventure. The recommended starting role for each hero
is **Aragorn** : Captain; **Beravor** : Pathfinder; **Bilbo** : Burglar;
**Elena** : Musician; **Gimli** : Guardian; and **Legolas** : Hunter.
Heroes will be able to change roles between adventures.

Each player takes the following 15 **skill cards** : 1 copy
of each card numbered 1-6 with the word _Basic_ on the
bottom of the card; the skill cards numbered 1-5 with
the name of your hero on the bottom of the card; the
skill cards numbered 1-3 with your role on the bottom of
the card; and 1 weakness card from the weakness deck.

Place the **starting skill card** for your role (with the number
1 after the role name at the bottom of the card and stars
next to the card name) faceup below your hero card.
Then, shuffle your remaining 14 cards together to create
your **skill deck** and place it facedown in front of you.

Select **Embark** in the app and follow the instructions,
placing map tiles and tokens as shown.

## PLAYING THE GAME

The game is played over a series of **rounds** , each of
which has 3 **phases** that players resolve in order:

## 1. ACTION PHASE

Heroes take turns in the order of their choice (the order
can change from round to round). **During your hero’s turn,
you can perform up to 2 actions** , which may be the same
action twice.

```
After all heroes have taken a turn, select the
hourglass button in the lower-right corner of the
app screen to proceed to the shadow phase.
```
```
Travel action
The map is made up of map tiles , each of which is
divided into spaces enclosed by gray borders. Spaces that
share a gray border are adjacent to each other. Spaces
separated by black borders are not adjacent unless they
are connected by gray borders that are aligned together.
```
```
When you perform a travel action, you can move twice.
Each time you move, move to an adjacent space. You
can interrupt your moves to perform the second action
of your turn.
Each map tile has a square box where an
exploration token may be placed, as indicated by
the app. A map tile with an exploration token on
it is unexplored. When you move into any space on an
unexplored tile, you must immediately explore the tile.
Select the appropriate exploration token in the app, select
the Confirm button, and follow the instructions.
Exploring a tile does not require that the hero ends their
movement in a space in that tile. Exploring a tile is not
a separate action: it is the result of a hero moving onto a
tile that has an exploration token.
```
```
Attack action
To attack an enemy group (one or more plastic figures of
the same type that move an attack together), choose an
item with a stat icon in the upper-left corner to attack
with, then choose 1 enemy group in range.
An enemy group in the same space as the hero is in
range. An enemy group in a space adjacent to the hero
is also in range if you are attacking with an item card
with the ranged icon.
```
```
Then resolve an attack test against that enemy group.
```
```
Interact action
If you are in the same space as a search , person , or
threat token , perform an interact action by selecting
the token in the app, then selecting the button with the
action icon and following the instructions. Then,
continue your turn.
```
```
You can inspect tokens in the app at any time by
selecting them and reading their text. Inspecting is not
an action, and you can select the Cancel button to close
the token’s description. However, if you select the button
with the icon, you are performing an interact action
and must meet its requirements.
```
## 2. SHADOW PHASE

```
The app guides players through these steps:
```
```
Enemy activation
Each enemy group attempts to move and attack. First,
the enemy group moves up to the indicated number of
spaces toward the targeted hero, taking the shortest
path of spaces possible.
```
```
It stops when it is in range of that hero (if it is in the
hero’s space or if it is in an adjacent space and has the
ranged icon on its portrait).
```
```
If the enemy group cannot get in range of its target
but can get in range of another hero, that closer hero
becomes the new target. If multiple heroes satisfy this
condition, the heroes choose which one becomes the
new target.
If the enemy can get in range of a target, the Attack
button is selected and the app displays the amount of
damage and fear that the hero might suffer.
```
```
If the enemy group cannot get in range of any target, it
ignores the entire instruction and the No Target button is
selected. This provides the enemy with a new instruction
(usually moving the enemy closer to a hero).
```
```
Darkness
Only resolve this step when the app instructs you to.
A hero is in darkness if any of these conditions apply:
```
- They are in a space with a printed darkness icon.
- They are in a space with a darkness token.
- The app states that they are in darkness.

```
Each hero in darkness suffers an amount of fear
indicated by the app.
```
```
Threat
Threat is represented by a threat bar at the top of the
app screen. When threat increases to a threshold’s
number, a threat event is activated in the app and
heroes resolve it by following its instructions.
```
```
If the threat bar ever fills completely, the game ends
and the heroes fail the adventure.
```
```
Threat increases during each threat step by:
```
- 2 for each hero playing
- 1 for each threat token on the map
- 1 for each unexplored tile

```
Some effects can cause threat to increase during other
game phases. At any time, you can select a threshold in
the app to view a brief description of its event.
```
## 3. RALLY PHASE

```
First, each hero resets their skill deck by shuffling their
discard pile into their deck.
```
```
Then, the app instructs the heroes to Scout 2. Each
player reveals the top 2 cards of their skill deck, and
may prepare one of them by placing it below their hero
card. If a card is prepared, the abilities on that card are
available to be used.
```
```
You can only have 4 skill cards prepared at a time. If
you ever have more than 4, you must discard cards until
only 4 prepared cards remain.
```
```
After choosing whether or not to prepare a card, each
hero places their cards that were not prepared on the
top or bottom of their deck in any order.
```
```
After scouting, select the Continue button and proceed
to a new round, starting with the action phase.
```
## COMPLETING AN ADVENTURE

```
The heroes win or lose an adventure together. In any
case, all of them proceed to the next adventure.
Each adventure has a series of objectives. During an
adventure, the current objective is displayed beneath
the threat bar. After completing 1 objective, the app
provides a new objective automatically.
```
```
If the heroes complete the final objective before the
threat bar is full, they win the adventure. If a hero is
defeated, the remaining heroes continue playing; but if
they do not complete the final objective by the start of
the next shadow phase, they lose the adventure.
```
## TESTS

```
To perform a test , reveal a number of cards from the top
of your skill deck equal to the value of your tested stat
( agility , might , spirit , wisdom , or wit ).
```
```
Then determine the number of successes. Each
success icon on the upper-left corner of revealed
cards is 1 success. Ignore the card text during tests.
```
```
You use successes differently depending on the test:
```
```
Some tests require the hero to input the number of
successes into the app by selecting the + button, then
the app provides the outcome of the test. The successes
for some of these tests are cumulative; the heroes can
perform the test multiple times, and the app tracks the
total number of successes.
```
```
Some tests provide a number that indicates how
many successes are required to pass. If the hero has
successes equal to or greater than the required number,
they pass the test.
Otherwise, they fail the test. In either situation, the app
provides the hero with further instructions.
After completing the test, places all the cards you
revealed during the test into your skill deck discard pile.
```
## FATE AND INSPIRATION

```
During a test, your revealed cards may contain fate icons
```
. These have no inherent effect; but the hero can
spend inspiration tokens (return them to the supply) to
convert fate icons to **success icons**. Each inspiration
spent converts 1 fate icon.

```
When you gain an inspiration, take an inspiration token
from the supply and place it on your hero card. You
cannot have more inspiration tokens than the inspiration
limit on your hero card.
```
## ATTACK TESTS

```
To perform an attack test , choose any number of your
equipped items to use for the attack, then choose a stat
in the upper-left corner to test from those items. If you
choose multiple items, all the items must have at least
1 stat in common, and the chosen stat must match an
icon that is on all of the items that you chose.
```

Then, spend **successes** to resolve one or more of
that item’s abilities. Each ability indicates how many
successes must be spent to resolve it, and each ability
can be resolved only once per attack.

Most abilities **add hits** to enemies: select the enemy’s
portrait, then the attack tab, then select the **+** button in
the attack pane to input each hit.

Abilities may also provide attack **modifiers** : select the
matching modifier(s) in the app:

```
Pierce: Hits ignore an enemy group’s armor.
Smite: Hits ignore an enemy group’s sorcery.
Cleave: Hits are applied to all enemies in an enemy
group.
Lethal: If an enemy’s remaining health (not armor
or sorcery) is halved during an attack, that enemy is
defeated.
Sunder: Permanently decreases an enemy’s armor
by 1. If an enemy is defeated, the armor of another
enemy in the group is also reduced by 1.
Stun: The enemy group is exhausted, and if the enemy
group is elite, it cannot counterattack.
```
After inputting all hits and modifiers, select the **Apply**
button to apply the hits to the enemies (even if you had
no hits). The enemy menu displays a **health** value for
each figure in the enemy group as well as their armor or
sorcery value. Hits reduce **armor** or **sorcery** values first.
If an enemy’s health is reduced to 0, it is defeated and
removed from the board.

If an enemy is not defeated, it regains all of its armor
and sorcery, and it may **counterattack**. The enemy group
can attack if it is in the hero’s space or in an adjacent
space and has the **ranged icon**. If it can attack,
select the **Yes** button and resolve an attack.

**Dual-wielding**
A hero can attack with more than 1 item if they all share

the stat that is being tested. Spend **successes** (^) to
resolve abilities on any of the chosen items. If you are
attacking an adjacent enemy group, all of the chosen
items must have the **ranged icon**.

## DAMAGE AND FEAR

When you suffer **damage** or **fear** , reveal a damage
or fear card from the appropriate deck and place it
faceup in your play area. Then, resolve the card’s
effect. If you are instructed to keep it faceup, it has a
persistent effect. If you suffer multiple damage or fear at
the same time, reveal each card one at a time, resolving
each completely before revealing another.

If you are specifically instructed to suffer facedown
damage or fear, place that damage or fear facedown next
to your hero card without reading the card’s text. You
cannot look at the text of a facedown damage or fear
card in your play area unless a game effect specifically
allows it.

```
If you are granted a chance to negate damage or fear
before you suffer it, test the indicated stat: each success
icon produced prevents 1 damage or fear (if you
choose to do so).
```
```
If you need to flip damage/fear cards faceup, select
them at random from among your facedown damage/fear
cards. If you need to discard a damage or fear card, you
may discard (to the bottom of the appropriate deck) a
faceup card of your choice or a random facedown card.
```
```
Last stands
After a hero has suffered damage or fear, if they have
a number of damage (faceup or facedown) equal to
or greater than their damage limit or a number of fear
(faceup or facedown) equal to or greater than their fear
limit, that hero must perform a last stand.
Select the party button in the lower-left corner
of the app. Then select the hero’s portrait and
the limit (damage or fear) that was reached, and
follow the instructions.
```
```
If you reach both of their limits, perform 2 last stands in
the order of your choice.
```
```
If you fail the last stand test, you are defeated. Remove
your figure from the board; the party loses the adventure
at the beginning of the next shadow phase unless they
complete the final objective.
```
## ENEMIES

```
Readied and exhausted
An enemy group is either readied or exhausted. Enemies
become exhausted (darkened portrait) either after the
app activates them or after they attack. Exhausted
enemies cannot activate, counterattack, or be provoked.
The app readies all enemy groups at the end of the
shadow phase.
```
```
Provoking enemies
While you are in the same space as a readied enemy
group, these actions will provoke that enemy:
```
- before you move out of a space with a readied
    enemy
- before you interact with a token in a space
    with a readied enemy
       To provoke an enemy, select the **provoke** button
       to the left of the enemy portraits in the app,
       then select the portrait of the enemy.
That enemy immediately resolves an enemy attack
against the hero as instructed by the app. After the
enemy attacks, you can continue your action.

```
An enemy group is not exhausted when it is provoked.
```
```
Interrupting enemy activations
Some abilities can interrupt an enemy’s activation to
apply hits or modifiers. Select the enemy’s portrait,
input and apply hits or modifiers indicated by the ability,
then continue the enemy’s activation.
```
```
Placing enemies
When an enemy group must be placed on the map, the
app indicates where the group is placed and how many
figures are in the group.
When an enemy group is placed, the app adds that
enemy group’s portrait to the enemy bar along the
bottom of the screen. There should be 1 enemy group
(containing 1 or more figures) on the map for each
enemy portrait shown in the app.
```
```
Elite enemies
An elite enemy group’s portrait has a spiked frame and
banner icon. When placed on the map, place the elite
banner token (red background) that matches that enemy
group’s banner icon along with the enemy figures.
An elite enemy group’s bonuses are listed in its enemy
menu. The app automatically applies all enemy bonuses,
but the heroes can select bonuses in the enemy menu
to view their effects. All elite enemies are also able to
counterattack even when exhausted.
```
```
Duplicate enemy groups
There may be multiple enemy groups of the same type
that are not elite. When this happens, each additional
enemy group is assigned an enemy banner, presented
next to that enemy’s portrait in the app. When you place
that enemy group on the board, place the matching
enemy banner token next to that group’s figures.
```
## CARDS

```
Abilities
Abilities that apply hits and modifiers to enemies are
not attacks. To resolve these abilities, input hits and
modifiers in the enemy’s menu and select Apply , but
always selects No if the app prompts a counterattack.
You can only resolve an ability on a skill card while that
skill card is prepared. If the card is not prepared (even
when it is revealed during a test), ignore its ability text.
When a card has multiple abilities, only one can be used
unless stated otherwise.
```
```
Title cards
Title card abilities can usually be used only once during
an adventure. When you gain a title card, take it and
prepare it immediately.
```
```
Weakness cards
If you gain a weakness card , place the top card of the
weakness deck in your skill deck discard pile. You can
prepare a weakness card to temporarily remove it from
your skill deck even though it does not grant any abilities.
```
```
Resetting the skill deck
You must reset your skill card deck during the rally
phase; when there are no cards remaining in your deck;
and when an effect instructs you to do so. Reset your
deck by shuffling your discard pile with any remaining
cards in your deck and place the newly shuffled deck
facedown. Do not shuffle prepared cards into the deck.
```
```
Boons
If you gain a boon , take a boon card of the appropriate
type. You can only have 1 copy of each type.
```
```
Trinkets
Trinkets are item cards with the trinket icon. When
you gain a trinket, search the unused item cards for the
specified card and place it faceup next to your other
items. Then place a number of depletion tokens on the
trinket equal to the number in the lower-left corner.
```
```
If you are instructed to deplete a trinket, you must
spend 1 depletion token by removing it from that
trinket’s card. After the last depletion token is spent, the
trinket is flipped facedown and cannot be used again
during that adventure.
During setup before each adventure, each hero can equip
1 trinket from among all the trinkets that the heroes have
gained. After each adventure, return all equipped trinkets
to the party’s inventory. Trinkets receive their starting
number of tokens at the beginning of each adventure.
```
```
Item cards
Abilities prefaced by a numeral and can only be used
by spending during an attack test. Items that can be
used during an attack test contain 1 or more stats in the
card’s upper-left corner.
```
```
A hero can equip up to 1 armor card, a number of
item cards that have a total of 2 or fewer hand icons
(2 items or 1 item), and 1 trinket. You may
equip more trinkets if you gain them during an adventure.
```
```
The lore value in the lower-right corner indicates how
much lore the party must gain before an upgrade for that
item becomes available; you always upgrade to a card of
the next higher tier (the roman numeral).
```
## ROLES

```
A hero can select a different role for each adventure.
When you select a new role, remove the role-specific
cards numbered 1-3 that correspond to the previous role
from your skill deck. Keep those numbered 4 or more.
```
```
Any skill cards you purchased remain part of your skill
deck if you select a new role.
```
```
When you gain experience at the end of an adventure,
it is always specific to the role you chose for that
adventure. You can only spend experience from a role to
purchase a skill card that matches that role.
```
```
When you sell a skill card, you gain experience for the
role that corresponds to the skill card that was sold.
```
## OTHER RULES

```
Nearby
A component is nearby another component if they share
the same space or are in spaces that are adjacent to
each other. A nearby space refers to that space and all
spaces adjacent to it. A component is not nearby itself.
```

## BATTLE MAP

Select a token to review its rules. Adventure-specific
tokens are highlighted in the app by a sparkle effect.

**BARRELS**
During the action phase, if you are nearby an enemy
group, you can **interact** with a barrels token in
your space (this does not provoke enemy attacks).
Perform a test. On at least 2 , you can apply
4 hits and _stun_ to 1 nearby enemy group of your
choice; then discard the barrels token.

**BOULDER**
If you are in a space with a boulder token while
performing a test to negate and , you may
convert 1 to 1 without spending an inspiration
token. Each boulder token can be used once during
each negate test performed by a hero sharing a
space with that token.

**BUSH**
During the action phase, if you end your turn in a
space with a bush token, you may perform a test
(this is not an action). On at least 2 , you become
_hidden_. If there are multiple bush tokens in a space,
you can perform the test once for each token.

**FIRE PIT**
When resolving an attack, if you are in a space with a
fire pit token, you can discard 1 card with a that
was revealed during that attack test to apply either
_pierce_ or _smite_ to the target. Icons on the discarded
card cannot be converted/spent during that test.

**MIST**
If you are in a space with a mist token, any damage
you suffer is suffered facedown. When attacking
an enemy group in a space with a mist token, you
cannot convert to by spending inspiration or
by resolving any other effect.

**PIT**
If you move into a space with a pit token, you must
perform a test. On fewer than 2 , suffer 2.

**STATUE**
When you **interact** with a statue token, perform a
test (this does not provoke enemy attacks). On at least
2 , you can apply 4 hits and _sunder_ to 1 enemy
group in your space; then discard the statue token.

**STREAM**
If the border between 2 spaces is covered by
a **stream** token, those spaces are adjacent and
components in those spaces are _nearby_ each other.

During the action phase, if you move across a
stream, your turn ends immediately. During the
shadow phase, if an enemy moves across a stream,
its activation ends immediately. If an enemy can end
its movement in range of its target but must move
across a stream to do so, it still moves; however
select **Cross Stream** instead of the **Attack** button.

```
A figure performing a ranged attack can be in range
of a target on the other side of a stream.
TABLE
When you interact with a table token, perform a
test (this does not provoke enemy attacks). On
at least 1 , gain 1 inspiration token and become
emboldened. If you are already emboldened you can
still gain inspiration tokens, and if you already have
your limit of tokens you can still become emboldened.
WALL
If the border between 2 spaces is covered by a wall
token, those spaces are not adjacent and components
in those spaces are not nearby each other. No figure
can move across walled border. Diagonal spaces
created by wall tokens are not adjacent. If a figure
can resolve a ranged attack up to 2 or more spaces
away, it may be possible to resolve the attack against
a target on the opposite side of a wall.
