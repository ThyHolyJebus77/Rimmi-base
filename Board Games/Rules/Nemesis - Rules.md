## Condensed Rules Summary

1. Setup: Place room tiles face-down on the board. Each player chooses a character and takes their miniature, character board, action cards, and starting items.

2. Game Structure: The game is played in rounds. Each round has two phases: Player Phase and Event Phase.

3. Player Phase: 
   - Players take turns performing 2 actions each.
   - Actions include: Move, Search, Shoot, Melee Attack, Pick Up Heavy Object, Trade, Craft Item, or use a Room Action.
   - After your actions, you may pass. Once all players pass, move to the Event Phase.

4. Event Phase:
   - Move the time marker forward.
   - Intruders attack if in the same room as characters.
   - Draw and resolve an Event card.
   - Draw a token from the Intruder bag to potentially spawn new threats.

5. Encounters: When entering a room with an Intruder or when certain events occur, resolve an Encounter by drawing an Intruder token.

6. Combat: Use Shoot or Melee Attack actions to fight Intruders. Roll dice to determine success.

7. Objectives: Each player has a secret objective. To win, you must complete your objective and survive by either entering hibernation or escaping in a pod.

8. Game End: The game ends when all characters are dead, in hibernation, or have escaped, or when the ship self-destructs or reaches its destination.

Remember, you're trying to survive while completing your secret objective. Be cautious of Intruders and potential betrayal from other players!

## Factions/Civilizations
Nemesis doesn't have distinct factions or civilizations. Players choose individual characters with unique starting equipment and abilities, but these don't represent larger groups or civilizations.

## Additional Information
The game features a high degree of randomness and narrative emergent gameplay. The intruder threat evolves throughout the game, and players must adapt to changing circumstances while pursuing their objectives.

## Expansion

[[Nemesis Lockdown - Rules|Nemesis Lockdown]] is a standalone expansion to the original Nemesis game.

# Nemesis - Rules

#### SETUP

Use the basic side of the board (red arrows icon). Shuffle all ##
room tiles and randomly place 1 tile facedown on each of the ##
room slots, then return the remaining ##2 tiles to the box. In the
same way, place all ##1 room tiles on the ##1 room slots.

Shuffle the exploration tokens facedown, and place 1 token
facedown on each room tile. Return the rest to the box.

Place 1 random coordinates card facedown on the space next to
the cockpit. Return the rest to the box.

Place 1 status marker on the B space on the destination track: this
is now the destination marker.

Place 1 status marker on the green space of the time track: this is
now the time marker.

Take this number of randomly chosen escape pod tokens: 2 (1-
players); 3 (3-4 players); or 4 (5 players). Return the rest to the box.
Place the lowest-numbered pod in section A, then the next highest
numbered pod in Section B. Place the other pods in increasing
numerical order, alternating between A and B. Place escape pod
tokens with their locked side faceup.

Shuffle both ##1 engine tokens facedown and place them on the
engine 1 slot on the board, one atop the other, facedown. The top
engine token indicates the true status of the engine. Repeat this
procedure for engine tokens ##2 and ##3 on the 2 and 3 slots.

Place the intruder board next to the board and place 5 egg tokens
and 3 random facedown weakness cards in the appropriate slots
(character corpse, intruder egg, and intruder carcass). Return the
remaining weakness cards to the box.

Place these intruder tokens in the intruder bag: 1 blank, 4 larvae,
1 creeper, 3 adults, and 1 queen. Then add 1 additional adult
intruder token for each player. Place the rest of the intruder tokens
next to the board along with the intruder carcass tokens.

Shuffle and place these decks facedown next to the board with
space for a faceup discard pile next to each: 3 items (each with
its own color), event, intruder attack, contamination and serious
wound. Place the crafted item deck next to the 3 item decks, and
the scanner next to the contamination deck.

Return all intruder player action cards and all solo / coop objective
cards to the box.

Place the rest of the markers, tokens and dice next to the board.

Take as many help cards (use the lowest numbers, up to the
number of players) as there are players and randomly deal 1 to
each player. Return the rest to the box. The number shown on your
help card is your player number. Each player takes the plastic
inventory card holder with their number to keep their item cards
hidden during the game.

Remove all cards showing a number of players higher than the
number playing the game from both objective decks (corporate
and personal). Shuffle the decks separately and deal each player 1
facedown card from each, then return the rest to the box.

Shuffle the character draft cards. Player 1 takes 2 random
character draft cards, reveals them, chooses 1 and shuffles the
other back into the character draft deck. Then player 2 chooses
their character the same way, then player 3, etc. A player may only
control the character whose card they have chosen. After the draft,
return the remaining character draft cards to the box.

Each player takes their chosen character’s character board
and places their character’s miniature (in a colored ring) in the
hibernatorium. Return the rest of the character boards to the box.

Take your character’s action card deck, shuffle it, and place it
facedown to the left of your character board.

```
Take your character’s starting item card, if available, and place it in
one of the 2 hand slots on your character board.
```
```
Place a number of ammo markers equal to that item’s ammo
capacity on the item card.
```
```
Place your character’s quest items, horizontal side up and inactive,
next to your character board.
```
```
Player 1 takes the first player token.
Place the blue character corpse token in the hibernatorium (treat
this token as a character corpse object). The blue character corpse
token is always assigned to the first dead body found on the ship.
```
#### GAME SEQUENCE

#### I: PLAYER PHASE

## 1: DRAW ACTION CARDS

```
All players draw cards from their action deck until they have a
hand of 5 cards. If your deck is empty, first shuffle the cards in your
discard pile to form a new action deck.
```
## 2: FIRST PLAYER TOKEN

```
On every turn except the first, the player with the first player token
passes it to the player on their left.
```
```
If players need to do anything in order, start with the player with the
first player token and continue in clockwise order.
```
## 3: PLAYER ROUNDS

```
Starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player
performs a round of 2 actions. Continue performing rounds in order
until all players have passed, then go to the event phase.
```
```
When you pass, you may discard any number of cards from your
hand. Then flip your help card to the Pass side. If you cannot or
choose not to perform any actions you must pass. If you perform
only 1 action instead of the required 2 you must pass. Once you
pass you cannot perform any actions later that same phase.
```
```
A character who ends their round in a room with a fire marker
suffers 1 light wound but won’t suffer any more wounds from fire
this round, even if other characters play their turn after them.
```
#### II: EVENT PHASE

## 1: TIME TRACK

```
Move the time marker on the time track 1 space to the right.
If the self-destruct sequence is active, also move its marker 1
space to the right.
```
## 2: INTRUDER ATTACK

```
Each intruder in the same room as a character operforms an attack.
```
## 3: FIRE DAMAGE

```
Each intruder in the same room as a fire marker suffers 1 injury.
```
## 4: RESOLVE EVENT CARD

```
Draw and resolve 1 event card. If the event deck runs out of cards,
shuffle the discard pile to form a new event deck.
```
1. Intruder movement: All intruders with the intruder symbol shown
    (and not in a room with any characters) move to a neighboring
    room through the corridor indicated by the number shown.
If the number indicates a technical corridor entrance, remove
    the intruder miniature from the board and put its corresponding
    intruder token in the intruder bag.
2. Event effect: Resolve the effect on the card, then discard it
    (unless specified otherwise).

## 5: INTRUDER BAG DEVELOPMENT

```
Draw 1 intruder token from the intruder bag:
```
```
Larva: Remove this token from the intruder bag
and add 1 adult token to the bag.
```
```
Creeper: Remove this token from the intruder bag
and add 1 breeder token to the bag.
```
```
Adult: All players, in order, perform a noise roll.
If your character is in combat with an intruder, you do
not perform a noise roll. Return the token to the bag.
```
```
Breeder: All players, in order, perform a noise roll.
If your character is in combat with an intruder, you do
not perform a noise roll. Return the token to the bag.
```
```
Queen: If there are any characters in the nest, place the
queen there and resolve an encounter. Otherwise, or if the
nest is undiscovered, add an egg token to the intruder
board. Return the token to the bag.
```
```
Blank: Add 1 adult token to the intruder bag (nothing
happens if there are none available). Return the blank
token to the bag.
```
#### CRITICAL MOMENTS

```
FIRST ENCOUNTER: When the first intruder miniature of any type
(not eggs) appears on the board, each player immediately chooses
1 of their objective cards to remove from the game facedown. The
encounter is then resolved.
FIRST DEAD CHARACTER: The first time any character dies, all
escape pods are automatically unlocked (flipped to their unlocked
side). They may subsequently be locked (and unlocked) normally.
```
```
SELF-DESTRUCT AND HIBERNATION: When the time track reaches
any blue space, the hibernation chambers open. Characters cannot
enter them before this happens.
```
```
When the self-destruct track reaches any yellow space, all escape
pods are automatically unlocked and the characters can no longer
stop the self-destruct sequence.
```
#### ACTIONS

```
The number in an action symbol is the cost to perform that action.
Discard that exact number of any action cards from your hand
faceup to the discard pile. The cost must be paid even if the action
is interrupted by another player, and if a one use only item action is
cancelled, discard the item.
Contamination cards are not action cards and cannot be discarded
to pay any action cost.
If an action does not have either of the following symbols, it may be
performed both in and out of combat:
```
```
In combat only: A character may only perform this action
in combat (if there is an non-egg intruder in their room).
```
```
Out of combat only: A character may only perform this
action when they are not in combat.
```
## BASIC ACTIONS

```
Each character has the same set of basic actions.
```
```
MOVEMENT: Move to a neighboring room directly connected
by a corridor (closed doors block movement). When
performing a movement in combat, you must escape instead.
```
```
CAREFUL MOVEMENT: Move as normal, but instead of
performing a noise roll after moving, place a noise marker in
a chosen corridor connected to the room you are entering. If there
is a noise marker in all the corridors connected to the room, or you
are in combat, you cannot perform this action.
```
```
SHOOT: Attack an intruder with a weapon in your hand,
discarding an ammo marker from that weapon’s card.
You can only shoot intruders in the same room. You may also shoot
uncarried eggs outside of combat
```
```
MELEE ATTACK: Attack an intruder in the same room
with bare hands or an improvised weapon.
```
```
PICK UP HEAVY OBJECT: Pick up 1 heavy object in the same
room (character corpse, intruder carcass, or egg). You don’t
need to use this action if you search and find heavy items.
```
```
TRADE: Start a trade with all characters in the same room.
Players may reveal and exchange any item cards and objects
they want to trade. Even though several players may take part in
the trade (with or without the active player), the only player that
performs the action is the one that started it. You may choose to
give an item card or object without asking anything in return.
Characters cannot exchange ammo.
```
```
CRAFT ITEM: Discard 2 item cards showing blue component
symbols to gain a crafted item with the same gray symbols.
ACTIONS FROM ACTION CARDS: You have a set of 10 action cards
you may perform. Discard the card from your hand faceup and pay
its cost (in addition to the action card with the performed action). If
an action card contains 2 sections separated by [OR], choose the
one you want to perform.
```
```
ACTIONS FROM ITEM CARDS AND ROOM TILES: Some item cards
and most rooms allow you to perform specific actions.
```
#### MOVEMENT & EXPLORATION

```
Characters and intruders may be placed and perform actions only
in rooms (escape pod tokens are the exception). They may never
stop in corridors; the effects of moving through a corridor are
resolved after moving into the room.
Characters may not access technical corridor entrances or the
technical corridors space, except with the use of certain cards.
After entering a room:
```
1. If the room was unexplored (facedown), turn it faceup.
    Then reveal and resolve the exploration token on that room tile.
2. If the room is empty (explored or unexplored, but no other
    characters or intruders), perform a noise roll.

## EXPLORATION TOKENS

#### 1. SET UP NUMBER OF ITEMS IN A ROOM

```
After revealing an exploration token, rotate the room tile until the
number on the token faces the item counter symbol on the board
next to the room tile slot: this is the number of items that can be
obtained from the room.
```
```
Do not set this number in the nest or in the room covered in slime.
```
#### 2. RESOLVE SPECIAL EFFECT

```
After resolving an exploration token, remove it from the game.
SILENCE: Nothing happens. Do not perform a noise roll
for this movement. If you have a slime marker on your
character board, resolve DANGER instead.
```
```
DANGER: Do not perform a noise roll for this movement. If
there is an intruder in a neighboring room that is not in
combat with any character, move it to this room. If there
is more than 1 eligible intruder, move them all. If there are no
intruders in any of the neighboring rooms (or if they are in combat),
place a noise marker in each corridor connected to the room
without a noise marker in it (including technical corridors).
```
```
SLIME: Place a status marker in the indicated slot of your
character board: you have been covered with slime.
```
```
FIRE: Place a fire marker in the room.
```
```
MALFUNCTION: Place a malfunction marker in the room.
```
```
DOORS: Place a door token in the corridor through which
you entered the room. Door tokens can never be placed
in technical corridors.
```

## NOISE ROLL

To resolve a noise roll, roll a noise die:

1, 2, 3 OR 4: Place a noise marker in a corridor with the matching
number that is connected to the room you entered (including
technical corridors).

DANGER: If there is an intruder in a neighboring room that
is not in combat with any character, move it to this room.
If there is more than 1 eligible intruder, move them all.
If there are no intruders in any of the neighboring rooms (or if they
are in combat), place a noise marker in each corridor connected to
the room without a noise marker in it (including technical corridors).

```
SILENCE: Nothing happens; do not place a noise marker.
If you have a slime marker on your character board,
resolve DANGER instead.
```
#### NOISE MARKERS

A corridor may never have more than 1 noise marker. If you have
to place a noise marker in a corridor that already contains one,
resolve an encounter instead.

If a noise marker must be placed and the number leads to a
technical corridor entrance, place the marker on the technical
corridors space.

## INTRUDER MOVEMENT

If an intruder ends its movement in an unexplored room, do not
reveal the room or its exploration token.

If an intruder moves to a technical corridors entrance, it disappears
in the ducts: discard all its injury markers, return its token to the
intruder bag, and remove its miniature from the board. If there was
a noise marker on the technical corridors space, do not remove it.

When an intruder tries to move through a corridor with a closed
door token, it does not move, but destroys the door instead. If
several intruders are moving from the same room, their movement is
simultaneous: they destroy the door and all stay in the starting room.

If you must place an adult intruder and all 8 models are already on
the board, they retreat. Remove all adult intruders not in combat
and put the corresponding intruder tokens back in the intruder bag
(if possible). Then, place an adult intruder model in the room where
the encounter occurred.

#### MARKERS

#### DOORS

Door tokens are only placed in corridors and a corridor may never
hold more than one. They do not affect noise markers.

Open doors are indicated by removing the door token from the
corridor. At the start of the game, all corridors have open doors.
If there are no door tokens left when you must place a door, take
any door token on the board.

Closed doors (standing door token) prevent characters, intruders,
and thrown grenades moving through the corridor. When one or
more intruders try to move through a corridor with a closed door
(including after a DANGER result on a noise roll), they do not move,
but destroy the door instead.

Destroyed (door token lying down) allow movement through the
corridor. A destroyed door can never be closed again.

#### FIRE

If you must place a fire marker and there are none left, the ship
explodes and the game ends.

A room may never hold more than 1 fire marker (if you must place
another, nothing happens). They may be placed in an unexplored
room. You can still use a room or search action when there is a fire
marker in a room.

#### MALFUNCTION

If there is a malfunction marker in a room or special room, that
room’s action is unavailable (you may still search).

```
A malfunction marker can never be placed in the nest or in the
room covered in slime. A malfunction marker in the hibernatorium
has no effect on already hibernated characters. The status of the
engines is never affected by a malfunction marker. If there is a
malfunction marker in a room with a computer, the computer is
unavailable (as if there was no computer symbol).
```
```
If you must place a malfunction marker and there are none left,
the ship loses hull integrity and the game ends.
```
```
A room may never hold more than 1 malfunction marker (if you
must place another, nothing happens). They may not be placed in
an unexplored room.
```
#### SLIME

```
You may never have more than 1 slime marker at a time (if you get
another, nothing happens). You may get rid of a slime marker by
using the Clothes item card or by taking a shower room action.
```
#### ENCOUNTERS

```
An encounter occurs when, after drawing an intruder token from
the intruder bag, an intruder appears in a room where there is a
character. They may also be triggered by the effects of some event
or intruder attack cards. An intruder moving from one room to
another room where there is a character is not an encounter.
```
```
If you enter a room occupied by an intruder, do not resolve an
encounter: you and the intruder are immediately in combat.
```
```
To resolve an encounter:
```
1. Discard all noise markers from all the corridors connected to the
    room (including technical corridors).
2. Draw 1 intruder token from the intruder bag.
3. Place an intruder miniature in the room of a type corresponding
    to the intruder symbol on the token.
4. If the number of action cards (including contamination cards)
    in your hand is lower than the number on the intruder token, a
    surprise attack occurs. Otherwise nothing happens.
Put the drawn intruder token aside; it may return to the bag if an
intruder of that type hides (by entering the technical corridors
during intruder movement).

```
If you draw the blank token, place a noise marker in each corridor
connected to the room in which the encounter took place. If this
was the last token in the intruder bag, add 1 adult intruder token
to the bag. If there are none available, nothing happens. Return the
blank token to the intruder bag and the encounter ends.
```
#### COMBAT

```
A character and an intruder in the same room are in combat.
```
## CHARACTER ATTACKS INTRUDER

```
During your action round, you may attack an intruder in the same
room using a shoot action (if you have a weapon with at least 1
ammo) or a melee attack action.
```
#### SHOOT ACTION:

1. Choose a weapon and 1 intruder to shoot.
2. Discard 1 ammo from the weapon’s card.
3. Roll the combat die (see reference sheet).

#### MELEE ATTACK ACTION:

1. Draw 1 contamination card and add it to your action discard pile.
2. Choose 1 intruder to attack.
3. Roll the combat die (see reference sheet).

## CHARACTER ESCAPE

```
During your action round, you may try to escape from combat
by performing a movement action to go to a neighboring room
(explored or unexplored).
```
```
Before moving, resolve a separate intruder attack for each intruder
in the room you are escaping from.
```
```
If you die, your character corpse stays in the room you tried to
escape from.
```
```
If you survive, end your movement in the neighboring room. If there
is no one in that room, perform a noise roll; if it is unexplored, explore
it as normal.
```
## INTRUDER ATTACK

```
Intruder attacks happen during a surprise attack, the intruder
attack step in the event phase, or during a character escape.
Each intruder attack follows these steps:
```
1. Choose a character in the same room as the target. If there is
    more than one, intruders attack the character with the fewest
    action cards in hand. On a tie, the character with the first player
    token (or the next player in turn order) is attacked.
Surprise attack: The target is whomever triggered the encounter.
Escape: The target is whomever is performing the escape action.
2. Draw and resolve 1 intruder attack card. If the card has an
    intruder symbol matching the attacking intruder, resolve the
    card effect (ignore the blood symbol). If not, the attack misses.

```
After resolving an intruder attack card, place it on the intruder
discard pile. If the intruder attack deck runs out of cards, reshuffle
its discard pile to form a new deck.
INFEST: If the intruder attack is performed by a larva, do not draw
any intruder attack cards. Instead, if the targeted player doesn’t
have a larva miniature on their character board, remove the larva
from the board and place it on their board. The player then takes 1
contamination card.
```
## ATTACKING PLAYERS

```
Characters cannot directly attack other characters, but may
accidentally or intentionally harm them as a side effect of their
actions.
```
#### CHARACTER WOUNDS AND DEATH

```
When you suffer a light wound, place a wound marker in the upper
space of your light wound track on your character board.
```
```
If a marker is already there, move it to the lower space (where it
represents 2 light wounds).
```
```
If there is already a wound marker on the lower space, discard it
and suffer a serious wound. Draw 1 serious wound card (identical
cards are not cumulative). From now on, you are affected by the
effect described on it.
```
```
If you have 3 serious wounds and suffer any additional wound
(light or serious), you are killed. Remove your miniature from
the board and place a character corpse token and all your heavy
objects in the room. Remove your other items from the game.
```
#### DRESSING AND HEALING WOUNDS

```
Dress serious wound: Flip a serious wound card affecting you to its
other side. From now on, ignore its effect, but it still counts against
the limit of 3 serious wounds.
Heal: Either remove (light wound) or discard (dressed serious
wound card) the wound mentioned in the action effect.
```
#### INTRUDER INJURIES AND DEATH

```
When an intruder suffers injuries, place the corresponding number
of injury markers on its base.
Then check the injury effect:
Larva and egg: Remove the miniature from the board.
```
```
Creeper or adult intruder: Draw 1 intruder attack card. Ignore
everything on it except the blood symbol.
If the number in the symbol is equal to or lower than the
current number of injury markers on the intruder, remove
its miniature and place 1 intruder carcass token in the
room. Otherwise, the intruder stays alive.
```
```
Breeder or queen: Draw 2 intruder attack cards, add the blood
symbol values, and compare the total to the current number of
injury markers on the intruder. Resolve as above.
```
```
During the injury effect check, if there is a retreat arrow in
the blood symbol of any of the drawn intruder attack
cards, the intruder flees.
```
```
Draw an event card and move the intruder through the corridor
whose number appears in the card’s intruder movement section;
then discard the card. The queen and breeders will retreat if any of
the 2 cards drawn has the retreat symbol.
```
#### CONTAMINATION CARDS

```
When you draw a contamination card, place it on top of your action
discard pile.
Contamination cards do not provide any additional actions and
cannot be spent to pay action costs.
If any rule asks you to remove a contamination card, remove it from
the game. Whatever the procedure to get rid of the card, it requires
a scan. Place the scanner’s red part over the coded field of the
contamination card. If the word INFECTED does not appear, the
card is not infected.
If it does appear, place a larva miniature on your character board
(and do not remove this contamination card). If there is already
one on your character board, your character dies, and you place 1
creeper in the room where you died.
```
#### INTRUDER WEAKNESS CARDS

```
To discover a weakness card, any character can research one of the
available objects (character corpse, intruder carcass, or egg) in the
laboratory room. After researching an object, flip the corresponding
weakness card faceup and leave it on the intruder board.
Discovered weakness cards modify the basic rules of the intruders,
giving all players a small advantage.
```
#### OBJECTS AND ITEMS

#### CHARACTER HANDS AND INVENTORY

```
There are 2 types of item cards: heavy items (kept in your hands)
and normal items (kept in your inventory). You may also carry
object tokens, which are all heavy (character corpse, intruder
carcass, and egg).
```
```
All normal items may be kept secret from the other players in your
inventory (plastic card holder). Other players can only see the color
of the items. When any item card is used it must be shown to all
other players. There is no limit to the number of items that can be
in your inventory.
```
```
Heavy items (as weapons) are indicated by the hand
symbol. They can never be kept secret from the other
players and cannot be put in your inventory.
When you gain a heavy item (or pick up a heavy object) you wish
to keep, it must be placed in 1 of your 2 hand slots. If both of the
hand slots are already taken and you want to take another heavy
item/object, you must drop 1 of the carried heavy items/objects.
```
```
Each weapon acquired during the game comes into play loaded
with 1 ammo token. A weapon can never exceed its ammo
capacity, shown on the card.
Sometimes, you can add an item card to another item card; place
the added item next to the indicated item card. From now on, both
cards are treated as one. The Duct Tape item card allows you to
combine 2 heavy items, so they take up only 1 hand slot (but it
doesn’t apply to objects).
```
```
Item cards marked as one use only must be discarded after use.
```
#### DROP

```
You may drop any item/object from your hands/inventory any time
during your turn without using an action. Objects remain in the
room where they are dropped. Items are lost (discard the card).
```

#### SEARCHING

Apart from the character-dedicated items, there are 4 colors of
items: red (military), yellow (technical), green (medical), blue
(crafted).

The red, yellow, and green decks contain items which can be found
in rooms when using a search action. The color of any item found
during a search action should match the color of the searched
room (the background color under its name and rule text). When
searching in a white room, the player can choose to draw from any
of these 3 decks.

Each time a character performs a search action in a room, reduce
the room’s item counter by 1. When the item counter reaches 0,
the room has been emptied and cannot be searched anymore.

#### CRAFTING

Blue deck item cards are crafted items which can be assembled
out of other items you have. You may look through this deck at any
time. A crafted item cannot be built if its card is not available, even
if you have the required blue components.

To build a crafted item, perform a craft item basic action and
discard 2 item cards showing the blue component symbols
corresponding to the grey components symbols of the crafted item
you want to build. Then draw the desired crafted item card from
the deck.

#### QUEST ITEMS

Once the requirement of one of your quest cards is fulfilled, it is
flipped faceup on its vertical side and becomes a normal item card.

#### PLAYER GOALS AND GAME END

To win, you must fulfill the objective on your objective card and
survive by either hibernating with the ship still functioning and
jumping to Earth or using an escape pod to evacuate the ship.

If you use an escape pod, hibernate or die, you can no longer
participate in the game (however if you were the first to die you
may continue the game as an intruder). At the end of the game,
only characters that are still alive determine if their objectives have
been met and if they have won or not.

The game ends when one of these conditions is met:

a. The time marker reaches the red space of the time track. The
ship jumps into hyperspace: all characters on board who are not
in hibernation die. The intruders survive.

b. The self-destruct marker reaches the red space of the self-
destruct track or you must place a 9th fire marker or a 9th
malfunction marker. The ship explodes: all characters on board
(awake and in hibernation) and all intruders die.

c. The last alive, non-hibernating character on the ship dies,
hibernates or uses an escape pod. If the self-destruct sequence
was active, move its marker to the red space. If not, move the
time marker to the red space. Resolve the effects of those
markers as described above.

If one of the conditions above is met and at least 1 character
survived (either asleep in the hibernatorium or evacuated in an
escape pod), go to the victory check step.

#### VICTORY CHECK

#### 1. ENGINES CHECK

```
If the ship survived up to this moment, reveal the top engine tokens
of each of the 3 engines.
If 2 or 3 of the top engine tokens have a damaged status, the ship
explodes and all the hibernating characters and all intruders die.
A malfunction marker in the engine room only disables the
room action. A working engine is not damaged even if there is a
malfunction marker there.
```
#### 2. COORDINATES CHECK

```
If the ship survived up to this moment, reveal the coordinates card
and check the current space of the destination marker.
If the ship is not headed toward Earth, all characters asleep
in the hibernatorium die. The intruders survive.
The Quarantine objective requires another jump destination (Mars)
and is the exception: any character with this objective does not die
if they are asleep in the hibernatorium and the ship’s destination
is Mars.
```
```
In any case, the ship is not destroyed.
```
#### 3. CONTAMINATION CHECK

```
Each alive character (either asleep in the hibernatorium or
evacuated in an escape pod) scans their contamination cards.
a. If there is a larva on your character board, skip this step. Scan all
the contamination cards in your action deck, discard pile, and
hand.
b. If there is at least 1 INFECTED card, shuffle all your cards (both
action and contamination) to create a new action deck, then
draw the 4 top cards. If you draw at least 1 contamination card
(INFECTED or not), you die. If there are none, they survive.
```
#### 4. OBJECTIVE CHECK

```
If there are any characters still alive, each of them reveals their
objective card to the other players and checks to see if they have
met all its requirements.
```
#### OBJECTIVES

```
PLAYER X’S CHARACTER CANNOT SURVIVE: Your character cannot
be alive at the end of the game (they cannot hibernate or escape
using an escape pod).
```
```
YOUR CHARACTER IS THE ONLY SURVIVOR: No character but yours
may survive the game.
```
```
SENDING THE SIGNAL: You must locate the comms room and
perform its room action.
```
```
THE SHIP MUST REACH EARTH/MARS: The ship will reach its
destination if the right coordinates have been set in the cockpit and
if at least 2 of its 3 engines are still working.
```
```
DISCOVER A WEAKNESS: Weaknesses can be discovered by
bringing an object to the laboratory and performing the laboratory
room action. It doesn’t matter who does the research, as long as
the weakness has been discovered at the end of the game. Intruder
eggs may be found in the nest.
```
```
DESTROY THE NEST: The nest is destroyed when there are no
intruder eggs left in it. To destroy eggs, see the nest room.
```
#### SOLO & COOPERATIVE MODE

## SOLO MODE

```
This mode has its own solo/coop objectives deck. At the start of the
game, draw 2 cards from this deck (instead of the regular objective
cards). Once the first encounter occurs, you must choose 1 of
these 2 objective cards.
The number of items available in each room is reduced by half,
rounding up.
To win, you must fulfill your objective and survive.
```
## FULLY COOPERATIVE MODE

```
This mode has its own solo/coop objectives deck. At the start of
the game, draw 1 card per player (instead of the regular objective
cards). To win the game, all these objectives must be fulfilled and at
least 1 character must survive.
If there is 1 card requiring you to send the signal, only 1 character
must fulfil it. If there are 2 or more such requirements, that many
characters must send the signal.
```
```
The emergency room allows the crew to revive any near-death
character. When a character dies, another character may pick
up their corpse token and carry it to the working emergency
room. A player whose corpse is in the emergency room places
their character miniature there at the start of the next round. All
their light wounds are discarded and all their serious wounds are
dressed. The emergency room does not work if there’s an intruder
or a malfunction token in it.
```
#### PLAYING AS AN INTRUDER

```
This optional mode allows the first player whose character dies to
continue playing the game by controlling the intruders (and slightly
increases the difficulty level for the rest of the players).
If 2 characters die simultaneously, the player with the lower player
number gets to control them.
The player controlling the intruders removes all their former
character’s components from the game, then shuffles the intruder
player action deck and place it in front of them.
```
```
Finish the current turn according to the standard rules. Any
changes are applied only at the start of the next player phase.
```
## TURN SEQUENCE

#### PLAYER PHASE

1. DRAW ACTION CARDS: The intruder player draws 3 cards (their
    hand limit is 4 cards).
2. FIRST PLAYER TOKEN: The intruder player is omitted during this
    phase (they never take the first player token).
3. PLAYER ROUNDS: The intruder player follows the standard order
    of play for playing their rounds, but they can only take 1 action
    (by playing a card from their hand) or pass. When passing, the
    intruder player may choose to keep 1 card from their hand and
    discard the rest.

```
During their round, the intruder player can play an intruder action
card in 1 of these 3 ways:
```
1. MOVE: Move any intruder through a corridor with a number
    matching the one printed on the intruder action card. If the
    intruder moves to a technical corridor, proceed according to the
    normal rules.
2. ATTACK: Choose any intruder in the same room as a character.
    The intruder attacks that character, following the normal rules,
    with one exception: the intruder player draws a number of
    intruder attack cards equal to the number displayed on the
    player intruder card played this round. Then, they choose 1 of
    these cards to be resolved and put all the others at the bottom of
    the intruder attack deck.
3. EFFECT: Resolve the effect on the intruder action card.

#### EVENT PHASE

```
Almost all of the entire event phase is omitted, with the exception
of the time track and fire damage.
```
```
All the other steps do not apply in this mode:
Intruders do not attack at the end of the turn (but they still make
surprise attacks during encounters or when characters escape
from rooms with intruders).
Event cards are not used unless as a result of intruder player
action card effects.
```
```
There is no intruder bag development step.
```
#### VICTORY CONDITION

```
The player controlling the intruders cannot win the game; their goal
is to ensure that no other players win.
```

movement in the neighboring room. If there is no one in there,
perform a noise roll; if it is unexplored, explore it as normal.
```
#### INTRUDER ATTACK

```
Intruder attacks happen during a surprise attack, intruder
attack step in the event phase, or a character escape.
```
1. Choose a character in the same room as the target. If there
    is more than 1, attack the character with the fewest action
    cards in hand. On a tie, the character with the first player

escape pods are automatically unlocked and the characters can
no longer stop the self-destruct sequence.
```
#### ACTIONS

```
In combat only: You may only perform this action in
combat (if there is an intruder in your room).
```
```
Out of combat only: You may only perform this action
when you are not in combat.
```
## BASIC ACTIONS

```
MOVEMENT: Move to a neighboring room (connected to
your room by a corridor). Closed doors block movement.
```
```
CAREFUL MOVEMENT: Move as normal, but instead of
performing a noise roll after moving, place a noise marker
in a corridor connected to the room you are entering. If there is a
noise marker in all the corridors, or you are in combat, you
cannot perform this action.
```
```
SHOOT: Attack an intruder with a weapon in your hand,
discarding an ammo marker from its card. You can only
shoot intruders in the same room.
```
```
MELEE ATTACK: Attack an intruder in the same room with
bare hands or an improvised weapon.
```
```
PICK UP HEAVY OBJECT: Pick up 1 heavy object in the
same room (character corpse, intruder carcass or intruder
egg). When you search and find heavy items, you do not need to
use this action.
```
```
TRADE: Start a trade with all characters in the same room.
If both involved players agree, they exchange the items.
The only player that performs the action is the one that started
it. Characters cannot exchange ammo.
```
```
CRAFT ITEM: Discard 2 item cards with blue craft icons to
gain a crafted item card with the same gray icons.
```
```
ACTIONS FROM ACTION CARDS: Discard the card from your hand
faceup and, in addition, pay its cost.
```
```
ACTIONS FROM ITEM CARDS AND ROOM TILES.
```
#### MOVEMENT & EXPLORATION

```
After entering a room:
```
1. If the room was unexplored (facedown), turn it over.
    Then reveal the exploration token on that room tile.
2. If the room is empty (explored or unexplored, but no other
    characters or intruders), perform a noise roll.

## EXPLORATION TOKENS

#### 1. SET UP NUMBER OF ITEMS IN A ROOM

```
Rotate the room tile until the number on the token faces the
item counter symbol printed on the board next to the room tile:
this is the number of items that available in the room.
Do not do this in the nest or the room covered in slime.
```
#### 2. RESOLVE SPECIAL EFFECT

```
After resolving an exploration token, remove it from the game.
```
```
SILENCE: Do not perform a noise roll. If you have a
slime marker, resolve DANGER instead.
```
```
DANGER: Do not perform a noise roll. If there is an
intruder in a neighboring room that is not in combat
with any character, move it to this room (if there is
more than 1, move them all). If there are no intruders in any of
the neighboring rooms (or if they are in combat), place a noise
marker in each corridor connected to the room without a noise
marker in it (including technical corridors).
```
```
SLIME: Place a status marker in the indicated slot of
your board: you have been covered with slime.
```
```
FIRE: Place a fire marker in the room.
```
```
MALFUNCTION: Place a malfunction marker in the
room.
DOORS: Place a door token in the non-technical
corridor through which you entered the room.
```
## NOISE ROLL

```
Roll a noise die:
1, 2, 3 OR 4: Place a noise marker in a corridor with a number
matching the result of your roll and connected to the room you
entered (including technical corridors).
```
```
DANGER: If there is an intruder in a neighboring room
that is not in combat with any character, move it to this
room. If there is more than 1 eligible intruder, move them
all. If there are no intruders in any of the neighboring rooms
(or if they are in combat), place a noise marker in each corridor
connected to the room without a noise marker in it (including
technical corridors, if there is an entrance in the room).
```
```
SILENCE: Nothing happens; do not place a noise marker.
If you have a slime marker on your character board,
resolve DANGER instead.
```
#### NOISE MARKERS

```
A corridor may never have more than 1 noise marker. If you
have to place a noise marker in a corridor that already contains
one, resolve an encounter instead.
```
```
If a noise marker must be placed and the number leads to the
technical corridor entrance, place the marker on the technical
corridors space.
```
## INTRUDER MOVEMENT

```
If an intruder ends its movement in an unexplored room, do not
reveal the room or its exploration token.
```
```
If an intruder moves to the technical corridors entrance, it
disappears in the ducts: discard all its injury markers, return
its token to the intruder bag, and remove its miniature from the
board. If there was a noise marker on the technical corridors
space, do not remove it.
When an intruder tries to move through a corridor with a closed
door token, it does not move, but destroys the door instead.
If several intruders are moving from the same room, their
movement is simultaneous: they destroy the door and all stay in
the starting room.
```
```
If you must place an adult intruder and all 8 models are already
on the board, they retreat. Remove all adult intruders not in
combat and put the corresponding intruder tokens back in the
intruder bag (if possible). Then, place an adult intruder model in
the room where the encounter occurred.
```
#### CRITICAL MOMENTS

FIRST ENCOUNTER: When the first intruder miniature of any
type appears on the board, everyone immediately chooses 1
of their objective cards and removes the other from the game.

FIRST DEAD CHARACTER: The first time any character dies,
all escape pods are automatically unlocked.

SELF-DESTRUCT AND HIBERNATION: When the time track
reaches any blue space, the hibernation chambers open.

When the self-destruct track reaches any yellow space, all
escape pods are automatically unlocked and the characters can
no longer stop the self-destruct sequence.

```
If a noise marker must be placed and the number leads to the
technical corridor entrance, place the marker on the technical
corridors space.
```
## INTRUDER MOVEMENT

```
If an intruder ends its movement in an unexplored room, do not
reveal the room or its exploration token.
```
```
If an intruder moves to the technical corridors entrance, it
disappears in the ducts: discard all its injury markers, return
its token to the intruder bag, and remove its miniature from the
board. If there was a noise marker on the technical corridors
space, do not remove it.
When an intruder tries to move through a corridor with a closed
door token, it does not move, but destroys the door instead.
If several intruders are moving from the same room, their
movement is simultaneous: they destroy the door and all stay in
the starting room.
```
```
If you must place an adult intruder and all 8 models are already
on the board, they retreat. Remove all adult intruders not in
combat and put the corresponding intruder tokens back in the
intruder bag (if possible). Then, place an adult intruder model in
the room where the encounter occurred.
```

#### ROOMS

You cannot perform a room action if it has a malfunction
marker or if you are in combat.

A computer symbol means the room has a computer. If there is
a malfunction marker in the room, treat the room as if there was
no computer symbol.

#### BASIC ROOMS (1)

###### ARMORY

RECHARGE YOUR ENERGY WEAPON: Add 2 ammo tokens
to 1 of your energy weapons (this action does not reload
classic weapons). A weapon can never exceed its ammo
capacity (as shown on its weapon card).

###### COMMS ROOM

```
SEND A SIGNAL: Place a status marker on the signal space
on your character board.
```
###### EMERGENCY ROOM

TREAT YOUR WOUNDS: Dress all your serious wounds or
heal 1 of your dressed serious wounds or heal all your light
wounds.

###### EVACUATION SECTION A

TRY TO ENTER AN ESCAPE POD: Only if any escape pod in
section A is unlocked and has at least 1 empty space.
Make a noise roll. If any intruder appears in this room, your
attempt to enter an escape pod fails.

If no intruder has appeared, place your character in 1 of section
A’s unlocked escape pods if there is any free space.
You cannot enter an escape pod if any intruder is present in the
corresponding evacuation section room.

###### EVACUATION SECTION B

As above, but applies to section B.

###### FIRE CONTROL SYSTEM

INITIATE THE FIRE CONTROL PROCEDURE: Choose any
1 room and discard a fire marker in it. All the intruders in
that room run in a random direction determined by drawing an
event card (draw 1 event card for each intruder). You can use
the fire control procedure to make intruders run away even if
there is no fire marker in the room.

###### GENERATOR

INITIATE / STOP SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE: You cannot
start the self-destruct sequence if any characters are
already hibernating. Place 1 status marker on the first (green)
space of the self-destruct track. Each time you move the time
marker, also move the marker on the self-destruct track by
1 space.

When any character stops the self-destruct sequence, remove
the marker.

When the marker reaches any yellow space on the self-destruct
track, the self-destruct sequence cannot be aborted anymore
and all escape pods are unlocked (but can be locked again).

When the marker reaches the last space (skull icon), the ship
explodes. If a hyperspace jump happens while the self-destruct
sequence is active, the ship is still destroyed.

###### LABORATORY

ANALYSE 1 OBJECT: You may only perform this action if a
character corpse, intruder carcass or egg is in the room
(for example carried by the character). Discover 1
corresponding intruder weakness card. The object is not
discarded afterwards, though you may drop it for free.

###### NEST

```
You cannot perform any search action in this room.
```
```
TAKE ONE EGG: Take 1 egg token from the intruder board
and perform a noise roll.
```
```
When there are no more eggs in the nest (they have all been
carried away or destroyed), the nest is destroyed: place 1 injury
marker in the nest to represent this.
If there is a fire marker in a room containing uncarried eggs,
destroy 1 uncarried egg during the fire damage step of the event
phase.
```
```
Destroying eggs: Whenever you are in a room with any uncarried
eggs, you may try to destroy them. Resolve this as a SHOOT
or MELEE ATTACK action. Each injury (of any type) destroys 1
egg. In the case of a melee attack action, you do not draw a
contamination card or suffer wounds if you miss.
```
```
You can also throw grenades into a room with uncarried eggs
as if an intruder were there. A grenade destroys 2 eggs and a
molotov cocktail destroys 1 egg.
```
```
After every single attempt to destroy an egg, you must perform
a noise roll.
```
###### STORAGE

```
SEARCH FOR AN ITEM: Draw 2 cards from the item deck of
a chosen color (red, yellow or green). Choose 1 card and
put the other at the bottom of the deck.
```
###### SURGERY

```
PERFORM A SURGICAL PROCEDURE: Scan all
contamination cards from your action deck, hand and
discards, and remove all INFECTED cards. If you have a larva on
your character board, remove it.
Then your character suffers 1 light wound and you automatically
pass. Shuffle all your action cards (including those in your hand
and discard pile) and place them in your action deck. Then pass
your round.
```
#### ADDITIONAL ROOMS (2)

###### AIRLOCK CONTROL

```
START EMERGENCY AIRLOCK PROCEDURE: Choose any
1 other yellow room (a yellow background on the action
part). The corridors connected to that room must not contain
any destroyed doors.
```
```
Automatically close the door in each corridor connected to the
room, and place the airlock procedure token in the room. If any
of the doors in corridors connected to this room are opened
before the current player phase ends, remove the token.
```
```
If all doors in each corridor connected to this room are closed
at the end of the current player phase (after all players have
passed), everything in that room dies immediately (both
characters and intruders). Then remove the token.
```
```
If there was a fire marker in the room, also remove it.
```
###### CABINS

```
CATCH A BREATH: When your character is in this room at the
start of a new turn and there are no intruders there, draw 1
additional action card (up to 6 instead of 5).
This room’s feature does not work if there is a malfunction
token in it.
```
###### CANTEEN

```
HAVE A SNACK: Heal 1 light wound. Additionally, you may
scan all contamination cards in your hand and remove all
non-infected cards.
```
```
If at least 1 of your cards is infected, place a larva miniature on
your character board (and do not remove this contamination
card). If there is already a larva on your character board, your
character dies and you place 1 creeper in the room.
```
#### ROOMS

```
You cannot perform a room action if it has a malfunction

###### AIRLOCK CONTROL

```
START EMERGENCY AIRLOCK PROCEDURE: Choose any
1 other yellow room (a yellow background on the action
part). The corridors connected to that room must not contain
any destroyed doors.
```
```
Automatically close the door in each corridor connected to the
room, and place the airlock procedure token in the room. If any
of the doors in corridors connected to this room are opened
before the current player phase ends, remove the token.
```
```
If all doors in each corridor connected to this room are closed
at the end of the current player phase (after all players have
passed), everything in that room dies immediately (both
characters and intruders). Then remove the token.
```
```
If there was a fire marker in the room, also remove it.

```
```
If at least 1 of your cards is infected, place a larva miniature on
your character board (and do not remove this contamination
card). If there is already a larva on your character board, your
character dies and you place 1 creeper in the room.
```

###### COMMAND CENTER

OPEN/CLOSE DOORS: You may choose any 1 room and
close/open any doors in corridors connected to it. You may
choose which doors to close and which to open, and you do not
have to open or close them all.

###### ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

CHECK ENGINE STATUS: You may check the status of the 3
engines (even if there is a malfunction marker in the
engine room). You cannot change the engine status.

###### HATCH CONTROL SYSTEM

```
LOCK/UNLOCK 1 ESCAPE POD: Flip 1 escape pod token to
its locked or unlocked side.
```
###### MONITORING ROOM

CHECK 1 ROOM AND EXPLORATION TOKEN: Secretly look
at any 1 unexplored room tile and its exploration token,
then place them back on the board. You don’t have to tell the
truth about what you saw.

###### ROOM COVERED WITH SLIME

YOU ARE SLIMED! Automatically get a slime marker. You cannot
perform any search action in this room.

###### SHOWER ROOM

TAKE A SHOWER: If you have a slime marker, discard it.
You may also scan all contamination cards in your hand
and remove all non infected cards. If at least 1 of your cards is
infected, place a larva miniature on your character board (and
do not remove this contamination card). If there is already a
larva on your character board, your character dies and you
place 1 creeper in the room where you died.

A fire marker can be placed in the shower room in the normal
way. The TAKE A SHOWER action does not discard a fire marker
from the shower room.

#### SPECIAL ROOMS

Special rooms are explored at the start of the game and
characters cannot perform any search action in them.
They can receive fire or malfunction markers normally.

###### COCKPIT

```
FLIGHT CONTROLS: CHECK COORDINATES or
SET DESTINATION.
```
CHECK COORDINATES: Secretly look at the coordinates card,
then place it back on the board. You don’t need to tell the truth
about what you saw.

SET DESTINATION: Move the destination marker to any space of
the destination track. You cannot change the destination when
any characters are already hibernating. You may never SET
DESTINATION if there is an intruder in the cockpit.

###### ENGINE ##

CHECK THE ENGINE: Check the current engine status in
this engine room by secretly looking at the top engine
token. You don’t need to tell the truth about what you saw.

REPAIR (OR BREAK) ENGINE: You may perform this action in this
room (using a REPAIRS action or a Tools item card) by taking
both engine tokens, secretly checking them, and placing them
back in the order of your choice.

You do not have to tell the truth if you have repaired the engine
or not, but you must say if you have changed the order of the
tokens. You can make this action even if there is a malfunction
marker in the room and even if you have not checked the engine
status.

###### ENGINE ##

As above, but applies to engine ##2.

###### ENGINE ##

As above, but applies to engine ##3.

###### HIBERNATORIUM

```
TRY TO HIBERNATE: You may perform this action only if
the hibernation chambers are open (the token on the time
track is on any blue space).
```
```
Perform a noise roll. If any intruder appears, your attempt at
entering the hibernation chamber has failed.
```
```
If no intruder appears, remove your miniature from the game:
you managed to hibernate safely and you no longer take part in
the game. Whether your character survives or dies along with
the ship is determined at the end of the game.
```
```
You cannot change the destination or start the self-destruct
when any of the characters are already hibernating.
```
```
You may never enter a hibernation chamber if there is any
intruder in the hibernatorium.
```
###### ESCAPE PODS

```
At the start of the game, all escape pods are locked.
During play, players may unlock them manually (by using some
of the item cards or room actions), or the pods will unlock
automatically when any character dies during the game or when
the self-destruct marker reaches any yellow space of the self-
destruct track.
```
```
If a given escape pod is unlocked, a character may enter
it (performing a noise roll first) through the corresponding
evacuation section room, as long as there are no intruders and
no malfunction token in the room.
After entering an escape pod place the miniature of your
character on 1 of the 2 spaces of that escape pod token.
Afterwards, decide if you want to launch an escape pod
immediately or wait.
```
```
If you launch immediately (or if you launch in one of the
following turns), remove your miniature and the escape pod
token from the game. You no longer take part in the game. Any
character in a launched escape pod is always treated as if they
have arrived on earth.
```
```
If you wait, you can decide to launch the escape pod at the start
of your first round during each player phase. You can also, if
you wish, exit the escape pod voluntarily, without performing
any action; during your round, place your miniature back in
the escape hatch corresponding to the pod you are leaving.
However, if you do not launch the escape pod in your round, it
means that you automatically pass this turn.
```
```
If (while you wait in the escape pod) an intruder appears in this
evacuation section room, then all characters in escape pods
are automatically returned to that evacuation section room.
Once another character enters the same escape pod as you,
they can decide to launch the escape pod immediately.
Heavy objects do not occupy any character space in an escape
pod.
```
#### ALTERNATIVE SIDE OF THE BOARD

```
This additional ship layout is primarily for campaign play. It can
be used in any game mode, but it is more difficult to survive
on it.
The double set of technical corridors work as usual, but each
one is not connected to the other (any noise marker in the
red technical corridors is separate from the blue technical
corridors).
Some of the rooms are connected to another room through a
pair of corridors. They are separate from each other, so any
closed doors in one corridor do not affect the other.
During setup, place the evacuation sections A and B faceup on
the highlighted spots on the map. Place an exploration token
facedown on each section (when a character enters these
rooms for the first time, explore as normal).
```
###### COMMAND CENTER

```
OPEN/CLOSE DOORS: You may choose any 1 room and
close/open any doors in corridors connected to it. You may
choose which doors to close and which to open, and you do not
have to open or close them all.
```
###### ENGINE CONTROL ROOM

```
CHECK ENGINE STATUS: You may check the status of the 3
engines (even if there is a malfunction marker in the

###### ROOM COVERED WITH SLIME

```
YOU ARE SLIMED! Automatically get a slime marker. You cannot
perform any search action in this room.
```
###### SHOWER ROOM

```
TAKE A SHOWER: If you have a slime marker, discard it.
You may also scan all contamination cards in your hand
and remove all non infected cards. If at least 1 of your cards is
infected, place a larva miniature on your character board (and
do not remove this contamination card). If there is already a
larva on your character board, your character dies and you
place 1 creeper in the room where you died.
A fire marker can be placed in the shower room in the normal
way. The TAKE A SHOWER action does not discard a fire marker
from the shower room.
```

about what you saw.
SET DESTINATION: Move the destination marker to any space of
the destination track. You cannot change the destination when
any characters are already hibernating. You may never SET
DESTINATION if there is an intruder in the cockpit.
```

You may never enter a hibernation chamber if there is any
intruder in the hibernatorium.
```
###### ESCAPE PODS

```
At the start of the game, all escape pods are locked.
During play, players may unlock them manually (by using some
of the item cards or room actions), or the pods will unlock
automatically when any character dies during the game or when
the self-destruct marker reaches any yellow space of the self-
destruct track.
```
```
If a given escape pod is unlocked, a character may enter
it (performing a noise roll first) through the corresponding
evacuation section room, as long as there are no intruders and
no malfunction token in the room.
After entering an escape pod place the miniature of your
character on 1 of the 2 spaces of that escape pod token.
Afterwards, decide if you want to launch an escape pod
immediately or wait.
```
```
If you launch immediately (or if you launch in one of the
following turns), remove your miniature and the escape pod
token from the game. You no longer take part in the game. Any
character in a launched escape pod is always treated as if they
have arrived on earth.
```
```
If you wait, you can decide to launch the escape pod at the start
of your first round during each player phase. You can also, if
you wish, exit the escape pod voluntarily, without performing
any action; during your round, place your miniature back in
the escape hatch corresponding to the pod you are leaving.
However, if you do not launch the escape pod in your round, it
means that you automatically pass this turn.
```
```
If (while you wait in the escape pod) an intruder appears in this
evacuation section room, then all characters in escape pods
are automatically returned to that evacuation section room.
Once another character enters the same escape pod as you,
they can decide to launch the escape pod immediately.
Heavy objects do not occupy any character space in an escape
pod.
```
#### ALTERNATIVE SIDE OF THE BOARD

```
This additional ship layout is primarily for campaign play. It can
be used in any game mode, but it is more difficult to survive
on it.
The double set of technical corridors work as usual, but each
one is not connected to the other (any noise marker in the
red technical corridors is separate from the blue technical
corridors).
Some of the rooms are connected to another room through a
pair of corridors. They are separate from each other, so any
closed doors in one corridor do not affect the other.
During setup, place the evacuation sections A and B faceup on
the highlighted spots on the map. Place an exploration token
facedown on each section (when a character enters these
rooms for the first time, explore as normal).
```

#### CARNOMORPHS

#### SETUP

Set up the game as normal using the basic side of the board (red
arrows icon).

Instead of the intruder board, place the carnomorph board
next to the main board and place 8 egg tokens and 3 random
facedown carnomorph adaptation cards in the appropriate slots.

Take 1 shambler, 1 fleshbeast and 1 butcher miniature and
place them on their corresponding adaptations.

Place these intruder tokens in the intruder bag: 1 blank, 2 blue
metagorgers, and 2 red metagorgers. Then, add 1 additional red
metagorger token for each player in the game.

Use the carnomorph event and carnomorph attack decks
instead of the corresponding intruder decks. Shuffle and place
the character mutation deck facedown with the other decks.

When using this expansion, consider the terms intruder and
carnomorph as being equivalent.

#### EVENT PHASE

## 1: TIME TRACK

Move the time marker on the time track 1 space to the right.
If the self-destruct sequence is active, also move its marker 1
space to the right.

## 2: INTRUDER ATTACK - FEEDING

Each carnomorph in combat with a character attacks that
character. If the voracious adaptation has been revealed,
carnomorphs feed before they attack.

When not in combat, a carnomorph feeds whenever it is in the
same room as any heavy object (character corpse/intruder
carcass/intruder egg) and/or a metagorger.

If there is more than 1 carnomorph in the same room, resolve
feeding in this priority order: butcher > fleshbeast > shambler >
metagorger

Resolve feeding by following these steps:

1. Heal: Remove all injury markers from the feeding
    carnomorph.
2. Evolve: Replace its miniature with a carnomorph miniature of
    the next level:
A metagorger becomes a shambler;

A shambler becomes a fleshbeast;
A fleshbeast becomes a butcher.

The butcher cannot evolve anymore: if it feeds, just remove all
its injury markers. A killed butcher can never come back into
play: in such a case, when a fleshbeast feeds, just remove all its
injury markers.

3. Eat: Remove the heavy object/metagorger miniature from the
    room. If necessary, remove in this priority order: red character
    corpse > intruder egg > intruder carcass > metagorger > blue
    character corpse.

When a carnomorph feeds, if there are no miniatures of the next
level available, it cannot evolve. Just remove all its injury markers
and the heavy object/metagorger from the room.

If there are still eggs on the carnomorph board, each
carnomorph in the nest room will consume 1 of them during the
intruder attack step.

```
All other rules that apply during the intruder attack step are
unchanged.
```
## 3: FIRE DAMAGE

```
Each carnomorph in the same room as a fire marker suffers
1 injury.
```
## 4: RESOLVE EVENT CARD

```
Draw and resolve 1 event card.
```
## 5: INTRUDER BAG DEVELOPMENT

```
Draw 1 intruder token from the intruder bag.
```
```
When asked to add metagorger tokens to the intruder bag,
always add red metagorger tokens instead of blue if they are
available.
```
```
Blue metagorger: All players, in order, perform a noise
roll, except if their character is in combat with an
intruder. Remove this token from the intruder bag and
add 1 metagorger token.
```
```
Red metagorger: Place a metagorger miniature in each
room already containing a metagorger (even in combat)
and/or a heavy object (even if the object is in a
character’s hands). If the nest is explored and not
destroyed, also place 1 metagorger there. Return the red
metagorger token to the bag.
```
```
Shambler: All players, in order, perform a noise roll,
except if their character is in combat with an intruder.
Return the shambler token to the intruder bag.
```
```
Fleshbeast: All players, in order, perform a noise roll,
except if their character is in combat with an intruder.
Return the fleshbeast token to the intruder bag.
```
```
Butcher: Place the butcher miniature in a room
containing a character with a slime marker and resolve
an encounter. Remove the butcher token from the bag.
```
```
If there is more than 1 character with a slime marker, the
one with the fewest cards in hand is affected. On a tie,
use the character order. If there is no character with a
slime marker, the butcher appears in the room with the
first player.
```
```
The butcher cannot fit into any technical corridors
entrance. If it should move into technical corridors, it
stays in the room instead.
```
```
Blank: Remove from the board all shamblers which are
not in a room with any character. Put their respective
tokens into the intruder bag. Add 1 metagorger to the
intruder bag. Then all players perform a noise roll in
order, except if their character is already in combat with
an intruder. Return the blank token to the bag.
```
#### CARNOMORPH ADAPTATIONS

```
Carnomorph adaptation cards replace intruder weaknesses.
```
```
Each time a new carnomorph type appears on the board, take
the corresponding carnomorph miniature from the carnomorph
board and reveal the appropriate adaptation card.
```
```
Characters may use the laboratory to analyze objects (character
corpse/intruder carcass/intruder eggs) and discard carnomorph
adaptations from the game, provided that the corresponding
adaptation is revealed and its miniature was removed from the
card.
```
#### ENCOUNTERS

```
When there is an encounter and you draw the blank token, place
a noise marker in each corridor connected to the room in which
the encounter took place.
If the blank token was the last token in the intruder bag, add 1
metagorger token to the intruder bag.
When adding metagorger tokens, always add red metagorger
tokens (if they are available) instead of blue ones.
```
#### FIRST ENCOUNTER

```
Remember that a metagorger which successfully performs
a surprise attack is treated as an encounter (even though it
disappears from the board instantly), so players normally then
have to choose the objective they keep.
```
#### MUTATIONS

#### MUTATION CARDS

```
Any time you are instructed to draw a mutation card, draw 2
cards, pick 1 and reshuffle the other one back into the deck.
```
```
Place the mutation card facedown next to your character board.
```
```
You can never have more than 1 mutation card: if you are
instructed to draw another one, nothing happens.
```
#### MUTATION MARKERS

```
Anytime you are instructed to get a mutation marker, if you
don’t have a mutation card, you get one instead of the marker.
```
```
If you do have a mutation card, place a mutation marker on your
character board in the space reserved for a larva.
```
```
When you get a 4th mutation marker, your character dies
immediately. Put a shambler miniature and a character corpse in
the room you died in.
```
```
There is no way of removing mutation markers during the game,
but you can get rid of the mutation card using surgery or the
antidote item. Mutation markers remain on your character board
until the end of the game, even you manage to remove their
mutation card.
```
#### MUTATION ACTION

```
To execute a mutation action, scan a chosen contamination card
from your hand and, regardless of the result, place 1 mutation
marker (use ammo/injury markers) on your character board.
```
```
If the contamination card is INFECTED, it goes to the action
discard pile and you perform the INFECTED action effect.
```
```
If the contamination card is NOT INFECTED, discard it from your
deck, draw a new contamination card and put it on top of your
action discard pile. Then, perform the NOT INFECTED action
effect.
```
```
The first time a mutation action is executed, flip the character
mutation card faceup so it is visible to everyone.
```
```
When a player gets an INFECTED result when scanning a
contamination card as a result of performing rest or shower
room/canteen actions, they get a mutation marker instead of a
larva miniature (remember if they don’t have a mutation card
yet, they draw one instead of getting the marker).
```
```
All other rules concerning contamination cards are unchanged.
```
#### METAGORGER ATTACK

```
Instead of drawing an attack card and checking its results, a
character attacked by a metagorger gets a character mutation
card, a contamination card, and suffers 1 light wound.
Add a shambler token to the intruder bag, and then remove the
metagorger miniature from the board.
If a character already has a mutation card, they only get a
contamination card and 1 light wound (the shambler token is still
added to the intruder bag).
```
```
All other rules concerning intruder attacks are unchanged.
```
#### CARNOMORPH INJURIES AND DEATH

```
When injuring any carnomorph, draw 1 intruder attack card
and check the injury effect. There are 2 numbers, one for
metagorgers and one for every other carnomorph type,
as indicated by the intruder symbols. If the number in the
corresponding icon is equal to or lower than the current number
of injury markers on the carnomorph, it is killed.
```
```
Metagorger and shambler: Remove its miniature and place an
intruder carcass token in the room.
```
```
Fleshbeast: Remove its miniature and place an intruder carcass
token and a shambler miniature in the room.
```
```
Butcher: Remove its miniature and place 2 shambler miniatures
in the room. Once the butcher is killed, it can never return to the
game in any way; return the miniature to the box.
```
```
Shamblers placed this way are not drawn from the intruder bag;
the number of tokens in intruder bag stays the same.
```
#### OBJECTIVES

```
Extreme Field Biology: At least 2 carnomorph adaptations must
be discarded.
```
```
The Great Hunt: Send the signal and the butcher must be killed.
```
```
Ab ovo: Intruder egg adaptation must be discarded.
Necroscopy: Send the signal and intruder carcass adaptation
must be discarded.
The blue character corpse can disappear, making 1 objective
impossible to fulfill.
```
#### CONTAMINATION CHECK

```
At the end of the game, each alive character (either asleep in
the hibernatorium or evacuated in an escape pod) checks their
contamination cards.
```
```
If there is a mutation card next to the character’s board, the
player skips step A and resolves step B.
```
```
A. The player scans all the contamination cards in their action
deck, discard pile and hand. If there is at least 1 INFECTED
card, the player gets a mutation card.
B. If the player has a mutation card next to their character’s
board, they shuffle all their cards (both action and
contamination) to create a new action deck, then draw the
4 top cards. For each contamination card drawn this way,
the character gets 1 mutation marker. If a character has 4
mutation markers, they die.
```

#### VOID SEEDERS

#### SETUP

Set up the game as normal using the basic side of the board (red
arrows icon).

Before shuffling the ##2 room tiles, remove the Room Covered
in Slime tile. Before shuffling the exploration tokens, remove 2
slime and 2 silence tokens, add add the 3 lair tokens.

Instead of the intruder board, place the void seeder board
next to the main board and place 5 egg tokens and 3 random
facedown void seeder weakness cards in the appropriate slots.

Place these intruder tokens in the intruder bag: 1 blank and 2
random void seeder tokens. Then, add 1 additional random void
seeder token for each player in the game.

Use the void seeder event and void seeder attack decks instead
of the corresponding intruder decks.

After choosing characters, add 1 insanity token of the
corresponding player color for each player taking part in the
game to the intruder bag. Place 1 insanity track card on each
character board (overlapping the miniature picture and slime
space), and put a status marker on space 1 of the track.

When using this expansion, consider the terms intruder and
carnomorph as being equivalent.

When using this expansion, players never put any intruder
miniature on their character board, or any status marker on the
slime space. Ignore all rules concerning slime markers.

#### EVENT PHASE

## 1: TIME TRACK

Move the time marker on the time track 1 space to the right.
If the self-destruct sequence is active, also move its marker 1
space to the right.

## 2: INTRUDER ATTACK - FEEDING

Each void seeder in combat with a character attacks that
character.

## 3: FIRE DAMAGE

Each void seeder and lair in the same room as a fire marker
suffers 1 injury.

## 4: RESOLVE EVENT CARD

Draw and resolve 1 event card.

## 5: LURKING

1. Find rooms that contain any void seeder not in combat and
    with no character in any of the neighboring rooms (remember
    that void seeders ignore closed doors).
2. Place a noise marker in each corridor connected to these
    rooms (unless there is already one).
3. Remove all void seeders in these rooms from the board
    and add 1 random void seeder token to the intruder bag
    for each void seeder removed this way.

## 6: INTRUDER BAG DEVELOPMENT

```
Draw 1 void seeder token from the intruder bag.
```
```
Void seeder: All players, in order, perform a noise roll,
except if their character is in combat with a void seeder
or a lair. Return the void seeder token to the bag.
```
```
Character insanity: The player of the corresponding color
character resolves a panic card. Return the insanity
token to the bag.
```
```
Blank: Add a random void seeder token to the bag. If
there are no void seeder tokens available, nothing
happens. Return the blank token to the bag.
```
#### VOID SEEDER MOVEMENT

```
Void seeders ignore closed doors during their movement. When
moving any void seeder, treat all closed doors in any corridor in
their path as open doors.
```
#### ENCOUNTERS

```
Discard all noise markers from all the corridors connected to this
room (including technical corridors), then draw 1 void seeder
token from the intruder bag:
```
```
Void seeder: Check the insanity level of the character
who just triggered the encounter. Take a void seeder
miniature of the type indicated by the symbol on the
insanity track and place it in the room. Put the drawn
void seeder token aside.
If the player has fewer cards in hand than the number
appearing on the void seeder token, a surprise attack
occurs (see below).
```
```
Character insanity: Place a noise marker in each corridor
connected to the room where the encounter took place.
The player whose character triggered the encounter
resolves a panic card. Return the insanity token to the
bag.
```
```
Blank: Place a noise marker in each corridor connected
to the room where encounter took place. Return the
blank token to the bag.
```
```
If they are no miniatures of the required type left when an game
effect or encounter asks you to place a void seeder miniature
on the board, place a void seeder miniature of the immediately
lower type instead.
```
#### SURPRISE ATTACK

```
All void seeder types have the same surprise attack. Any
character targeted by a void seeder surprise attack gets 1
contamination card and resolves a panic card instead of drawing
an intruder attack card.
```
#### ENTERING A ROOM WITH A VOID SEEDER

```
Each time a character enters a room occupied by a void seeder,
do not resolve an encounter. The void seeder and the character
are immediately considered to be in combat.
```
#### INSANITY

```
Track insanity levels following the arrows on the insanity card. A
character cannot go below level 3 once they reach level 3.
```
```
Any character with an insanity level of 5 dies instantly if asked
to increase their insanity level again.
```
#### PANIC CARDS

```
When drawing a panic card, if the character’s insanity level is
lower than the value next to the panic icon on the card, or if the
effect cannot be resolved, the character increases their insanity
level by 1. Otherwise, resolve the panic card effect.
```
```
Interruption cards have an additional effect: when a character is
about to resolve a panic card effect, any other character in the
same room may play an interruption card to cancel that effect,
and the player who drew the panic card does not increase their
insanity level.
```
#### LAIRS

```
Lairs count as intruders for the purpose of using any
actions (eg. grenade). When you reveal a lair
exploration token, do not perform a noise roll for this
movement. Place a lair miniature in the room. Lairs cannot move
and they are not moved by event cards, retreat or danger effects.
```
```
Characters in the same room as a lair are in combat.
Each time a character ends their round in a room with a lair, they
perform a noise roll (even though they are in combat). This is the
only way you can roll for noise when in combat.
```
#### LAIR INJURIES AND DEATH

```
To hit a lair with a shoot or melee attack action, a player needs to
roll at least.
When a lair suffers injuries, draw 2 intruder attack cards and
compare the total number of injuries with the highest number in
the blood icons of either of these cards. If the blood icon value is
equal or lower than the number of injuries, the lair is destroyed. If
any of the cards bears a retreat icon, the lair is not destroyed, no
matter the blood icon values.
Lairs may be also destroyed by the emergency airlock procedure.
```
```
When a lair is destroyed it leaves an intruder carcass token.
Place the lair miniature on a destroyed lair space on the void
seeders board.
When all 3 lairs are destroyed, the despoiler miniature is
removed from the game; it can no longer appear in the game.
```
#### VOID SEEDER INJURIES AND DEATH

```
Void seeders don’t die nor leave any carcass tokens. When a void
seeder is defeated, remove its miniature and add a random void
seeder token to the intruder bag.
```
```
Lurker: Draw 2 void seeder attack cards and choose the
lower number to check the injury effect. If any of the
drawn cards has the retreat icon, the lurker retreats.
```
```
Whisperer: Draw 1 void seeder attack card and check its
injury effect.
```
```
Stalker: Draw 2 void seeder attack cards and choose the
higher number to check the injury effect. If any of the
drawn cards has the retreat icon, the stalker retreats.
```
```
Despoiler: The despoiler cannot be destroyed by
conventional methods. It can never receive any injury
marker in any away. The only way to kill it is to destroy all
lairs in play. When the despoiler should suffer an injury,
draw 1 void seeder attack card. Any number in the blood
icon is ignored, but the despoiler may retreat as the
result of the attack.
```
#### LOCATIONS

```
Rest, canteen and shower room: When performing rest or
shower room/canteen actions, you may reduce your insanity
level by 1 (you cannot reduce your insanity level from 3 to 2)
and/or scan contamination cards from your hand.
```
```
If you get the INFECTED result while scanning your contamination
cards, your insanity level jumps to 5, even if you used the rest/
shower room/canteen action to reduce your insanity level. If
your insanity level is already 5 and you get an INFECTED result,
nothing happens (you still cannot reduce your insanity level
however).
```
```
Laboratory: Instead of analyzing a character corpse object,
you can now analyze a character insanity level. To do so, at
least 1 living character with an insanity level of 3 or more must
be present in the laboratory. All other rules concerning the
laboratory are unchanged.
Surgery: When you perform the surgery procedure action,
reduce your insanity level to 3 instead of removing a larva from
your character board. All other rules concerning surgery are
unchanged.
```
#### ITEMS

```
Antidote: When a character performs the antidote’s item action,
they reduce their insanity level to 3, instead of removing a
larva from their character board. All other rules concerning the
antidote item are unchanged.
```
```
Clothes: There is no slime, so ignore the rule concerning the
slime markers. Characters may still use clothes to dress their
serious wounds, however.
```
#### CONTAMINATION CHECK

```
At the end of the game, each alive character (either asleep in
the hibernatorium or evacuated in an escape pod) checks their
contamination cards.
```
1. For each contamination card, they raise their insanity level by
    1. The insanity level of any character cannot exceed level 5
    during this step (they cannot die).
2. Each player whose character has an insanity level of 5 shuffles
    all their cards to create a new action deck and draws the 4
    top cards. If there is at least 1 contamination card (infected or
    not), this character dies.

```
Characters with an insanity level of 5 skip step 1 and resolve step
2 directly.
```

#### EPILOGUE MODE

#### SETUP

First play a full regular Nemesis game. If you used any Aftermath
characters during that game, they will not be available in the
Aftermath game. If the ship was destroyed, the epilogue mode
cannot be played.

Remove all intruders from the board and put the corresponding
intruder tokens in the intruder bag. Then, add:

2 or 3 player game: 1 larva token and 2 adult intruder tokens.

4 player game: 2 larva tokens and 4 adult intruder tokens.
5 player game: 3 larva tokens and 6 adult intruder tokens.

If you run out of intruder tokens do not add any more tokens.

Remove all fire and noise markers from the board, and discard any
items that the players found or crafted.

Leave malfunction markers, door tokens and escape pods
where they were at the end of the regular game. Leave revealed
and unrevealed intruder weakness cards. Place status markers
on the revealed weaknesses: they are inactive until someone
rediscovers them. Rediscovering a weakness uses the same rules
as discovering a weakness.

Shuffle and place these decks facedown, next to the board:
intruder attack, aftermath event, contamination and serious
wounds. Shuffle the engine tokens and coordinates cards, and
place them on the board as in normal setup.

Turn over all unexplored rooms and reveal their exploration tokens
to set up the number of items in these rooms. Ignore any special
effects of the exploration tokens.

Shuffle the Aftermath exploration tokens and place 1 random
token facedown on each room tile and 1 each in the hibernatorium,
cockpit and engines.

Place the shuttle board next to the main board.

Shuffle all remaining additional room tiles (##2), without looking at
their fronts, and randomly place a faceup tile on each of the room
slots marked with a 2 on the shuttle board. If there is room covered
in slime, remove it and take another additional ##2 room tile.

Exchange basic help cards for Aftermath help cards. Take as
many help cards as there are players and deal 1 to each player
at random. These determine the order of choosing characters.
Each player takes the plastic inventory card holder with the same
number as their help card.

Shuffle all character draft cards and deal 2 to each player. Each
player picks 1 character and shuffles other card back into the
character draft cards.

Each player takes these components: character board, miniature,
action cards deck, starting item card(s), quest items and trait card.

The first player takes the first player token.

Each player, in the order determined by their number, places their
miniature in the main room.

Shuffle all personal requirement cards and deal 1 card to each
player.

Shuffle the alert cards deck and place it next to the board,
facedown. Reveal the first alert card.

Place the Lucrative Offer card faceup next to the board.

Place the time marker on the green space of the shuttle time track.

#### INTRUDER BAG DEVELOPMENT

```
This step doesn’t occur in the Epilogue mode.
```
#### EVENT PHASE

## 1: TIME TRACK

```
Move the time marker on the shuttle time track 1 space to the right.
If the self-destruct sequence is active, also move its marker 1
space to the right.
```
## 2: ALERT CHECK (TURNS 3 AND 5 ONLY)

```
Check to see if you have fulfilled the current alert’s requirements.
If you have, remove that alert card. If you have not, the game ends
with a defeat for all characters.
```
```
Afterward, if it is turn 3, reveal the second alert card.
```
## 3: INTRUDER ATTACK

```
Each intruder in combat with a character attacks them.
```
## 4: FIRE DAMAGE

```
Each intruder in the same room as a fire marker suffers 1 injury.
```
## 5: RESOLVE EVENT CARD

```
Draw and resolve 1 event card:
```
1. Intruder movement.
2. Event effect.
3. Perform a noise roll if the card has an alert icon.

## 6: END OF THE TURN

#### VICTORY CHECK

```
After turn 5, the shuttle leaves the Nemesis and goes back to the
mothership regardless of the characters on the shuttle board.
```
```
To win the game in this mode, a player must fulfill the following
requirements:
```
1. The players must have revealed all the Aftermath exploration
    tokens on the Nemesis. In a 2 player game, up to 3 exploration
    tokens may remain unrevealed.

```
If this condition is not met, the players lose.
```
2. The player must fulfill their personal requirement.
3. The player’s character must be on the shuttle board when the
    shuttle goes back to the mothership (or the character must leave
    the ship in an escape pod).
4. The players must resolve their contamination check (as in the
    base game).

```
Alternatively, if a player doesn’t want to help their teammates,
they can take the Lucrative Offer card at any time and discard their
personal requirement. Fulfilling the lucrative offer’s requirements
will give that player an automatic victory if they survive the
contamination check.
```
#### ADDING AFTERMATH COMPONENTS

```
When playing a regular Nemesis game, players can substitute any
basic character (and their cards) for the corresponding Aftermath
character (and their cards) with the same color.
The 4 new Aftermath ##2 room tiles, the 3 turret exploration tokens,
and trait cards can be added to the base game.
The Epilogue mode can be played after a research mission game
(or after a regular game using Aftermath characters), though you
cannot keep the same characters from one game to the other.
```
#### RESEARCH MISSION MODE

#### SETUP

```
This mode is a standalone Nemesis game using the Aftermath
elements. Set up the game as normal using the basic side of the
board (red arrows icon), with the shuttle board next to it.
Shuffle all ##2 room tiles without looking at them and randomly
place 1 tile facedown on each of the ##2 room slots on the 2 boards.
In the same way, place all ##1 room tiles on the ##1 room slots.
Reveal the room tiles on the shuttle. If you reveal a room covered in
slime, switch it with another random ##2 room tile.
```
```
Remove the doors and danger tokens from the exploration tokens,
add the turret tokens, shuffle them and place 1 token facedown on
each unexplored room tile.
Shuffle the Aftermath exploration tokens and place 1 token
facedown on each room of the Nemesis (cockpit, hibernatorium
and engines included). All room tiles will then have 1 exploration
token from the base game and 1 from Aftermath.
```
```
Place 1 random coordinates card facedown on the space next to
the cockpit.
Take this number of randomly chosen escape pod tokens: 1 (1-
players); 2 (3-4 players); or 3 (5 players).
```
```
Shuffle both ##1 engine tokens facedown and place them on the
engine 1 slot on the board, one atop the other, facedown. The top
engine token indicates the true status of the engine. Repeat this
procedure for engine tokens ##2 and ##3 on the 2 and 3 slots.
Place the intruder board next to the board and place 5 egg tokens
and 3 random facedown weakness cards in the appropriate slots.
```
```
Place these intruder tokens in the intruder bag: 1 blank, 4
larvae, 2 creepers, 3 adults, 1 breeder, and 1 queen. Then add
1 additional adult intruder token for each player. Place the rest
of the intruder tokens next to the board along with the intruder
carcass tokens.
Choose these events from the basic event deck: Lurking, Short
Circuit, Hunt (Intruder Move direction: 3), Scent of Prey, Damage,
Life Support Failure, Eclosion, Damaging Fire, and shuffle them with
the Aftermath event deck to create the research mission event deck.
Shuffle and place these decks facedown next to the board with
space for a faceup discard pile next to each: 3 items (each
with its own color), research mission event, intruder attack,
contamination, alert, and serious wound. Place the craft item
deck next to the 3 item decks, and the scanner next to the
contamination deck.
```
```
Place the rest of the markers, tokens and dice next to the board.
Place 1 status marker on the green space of the time track: this is
now the time marker.
Players receive their help cards, inventory card holder, objective
cards and character draft cards as normal. However, a player
controlling the android discards their personal objective facedown
and draws a second corporate objective.
```
```
Each player takes their chosen character’s character board and
places their character’s miniature (in a colored ring) in the main
room of the shuttle.
Take your character’s action card deck, shuffle it, and place it
facedown to the left of your character board.
Take your character’s starting item card (weapon) and place it in
one of the 2 hand slots on your character board. Place a number
of ammo markers equal to your weapon’s ammo capacity on the
weapon card.
Take your character’s 2 quest items and place them, horizontal
side up and inactive, next to your character board. Place your trait
card, horizontal side up, nearby.
Player 1 takes the first player token.
Place the blue character corpse token in the hibernatorium.
```
#### EVENTS & ALERTS

```
Each time you draw an event card bearing the alert icon, instead
of making a noise roll as in the Epilogue mode, draw 1 alert card
and set the shuttle time track on space 5 (ignore this icon if there
is already an alert already going on). You have 5 turns to complete
each alert.
```
```
Whenever the shuttle time track reaches the final red space, check
if you fulfilled all the alert’s requirements. If not, the game ends and
all characters on board die.
```
```
If there is an alert still going on when the game ends, check if you
fulfilled all the alert’s requirements. If not, the game ends and all
characters on board die.
```
#### INTRUDER BAG DEVELOPMENT

```
Resolve this step normally.
```
#### EVENT PHASE

## 1: TIME TRACK

```
Move the time marker on the time track, and (if present) the shuttle
time track, 1 space to the right.
```
```
If the self-destruct sequence is active, also move its marker 1
space to the right.
```
## 2: ALERT CHECK

```
Check the requirements for completing the alert.
```
## 3: INTRUDER ATTACK

```
Each intruder in combat with a character attacks them.
```
## 4: FIRE DAMAGE

```
Each intruder in the same room as a fire marker suffers 1 injury.
```
## 5: RESOLVE EVENT CARD

```
Draw and resolve 1 event card:
```
1. Intruder movement.
2. Event effect.

## 6: INTRUDER BAG DEVELOPMENT

## 7: END OF THE TURN

#### PLAYERS GOALS AND GAME END

```
Resolve these rules normally.
```
#### THE HOURGLASS

```
To add another layer of tension, use the hourglass.
```
```
Turn the hourglass over at the beginning of every game turn.
```
```
When any player notices that it is empty, they may pick it up, and
can then pick 1 room on the board and roll the noise die, applying
the usual rules. If an encounter takes place, a surprise attack will
target the player with the lowest number of cards in hand (if there is
no character in the chosen room, there is no surprise attack).
```
```
After resolving this noise roll, place the hourglass to one side. It will
be turned over at the beginning of the next game turn.
```
```
If any player objects against using the hourglass, it can be removed
after performing a noise roll.
```

#### AFTERMATH

#### ALERT CARDS

Alerts are short miniquests that the crew must complete. If an
alert is not completed in the assigned time, the game ends with
a defeat for all dharacters on board.

When alert requires you to place a sample in a specified
room, use the special objective tokens from Untold Stories ##1.
Samples are heavy objects.

If an alert is divided in 2 stages, you must successfully fulfill
the first stage before fulfilling the second (and final) stage, thus
completing the alert.

When fulfilling the first stage of an alert, mark it by placing any
marker on the green stage icon of the alert card.

ACTIVATION: Some alerts require performing the new
activation action. This new basic action may only be
performed in the room specified by the slert. It may be
performed both in and out of combat. The activation action has
no other effect other than fulfilling the task described on the
given alert card.

#### NEW ROOMS (2)

Along with the 4 new rooms, the expansion introduces 3 new
crafted item cards tied to one of the 4 new rooms: the Laser
Pointer, Combat Drone, and Enviro-Suit. These items cannot
be crafted outside of the crafting room, and require different
components than the ones needed to craft the items in the
base game.

###### CRAFTING ROOM

CRAFT SPECIAL ITEM: When any character in this room
performs the craft item basic action, they may exchange
one of the following items for one of the new crafted items:

Energy Charge = Laser Pointer
Tools = Combat Drone
Clothes = Enviro-Suit

The feature of this room does not work if there is a malfunction
marker in the room.

###### SERVER ROOM

```
USE ANOTHER COMPUTER: Use the room action of any
discovered, working room with a computer.
```
###### ALARM ROOM

MAKE NOISE: Choose any 1 other room without any
character in it. Perform a noise roll there. It may trigger an
encounter, though there will be no surprise attack.

###### TURRET ROOM

CONTROL TURRETS: Choose any 1 turret token on the
board and change its status. The changed status is placed
facedown on top of the status’ pile.

#### TURRETS

```
Place a turret miniature in the room in which its
exploration token was revealed. Turrets cannot be
placed in the nest or in a room covered with slime.
```
Their starting status is selected at random by shuffling the 3
status tokens and stacking them facedown next to the turret.
The topmost token is the current status of the turret. Turret
status is revealed when entering the room for the first time.

Turrets can be destroyed with a demolition action. Any
destroyed turret is removed from the board.

```
During the fire damage step, intruders always destroy any active
turret in their room. This is simultaneous with turret shooting,
so an intruder may destroy a turret while being killed in the
process.
Ignoring fire damage step does not apply to turrets.
```
###### TURRET STATUS:

######## INACTIVE

```
The turret is inactive and it cannot be destroyed.
```
```
TARGET: ALL
The turret shoots at everything that enters the room
this turn (any intruder spawning in the room counts as
entering it). Turret shooting is resolved during the FIRE DAMAGE
step. Characters receive 1 light wound, intruders receive 1
injury.
```
```
TARGET: INTRUDERS
As TARGET: ALL, but only works on intruders.
```
```
If you want to use turrets in the base game, add the 3 new
exploration tokens with a turret to your exploration token pool
and place the turret miniatures and their status tokens, next to
the board.
```
#### SHUTTLE BOARD

```
The shuttle consists of 4 rooms: the main room is printed on the
board; for the other 3, use randomly chosen additional ##2 room
tiles. The shuttle rooms do not have any item counter, so no item
may be found with the search action here.
```
```
The main room doesn’t have its own room action, though it is
referenced in some of the alerts
```
###### SHUTTLE MOVEMENT

```
When in the main room of the shuttle, a player may move to any
room of the Nemesis ship with a technical corridors entrance.
```
```
When in a room of the Nemesis with a technical corridors
entrance, a player may move to any additional ##2 room of the
shuttle.
```
```
The Nemesis and the shuttle are considered 1 ship for the
purpose of any remote action or rule (affecting another room,
the engines, etc.).
```
#### AFTERMATH EXPLORATION TOKENS

```
LOCKDOWN: Close all doors in corridors connected to

```
```
DANGER: As noise roll result.
```
```
EGG: Place an intruder egg heavy object in this room.
```
```
SLIMED ROOM: Leave this token on the room.
Each time you enter this room, you automatically get
a slime marker.
```

This does not trigger an encounter and you do not
perform a noise roll.
```
```
FIRE: Place a fire marker in the room.
```
```
CARCASS: Place an intruder carcass heavy object in
the room.

```
CORPSE: Place a character corpse heavy object

```
#### AFTERMATH

#### ALERT CARDS

```
Alerts are short miniquests that the crew must complete. If an
alert is not completed in the assigned time, the game ends with
a defeat for all dharacters on board.
When alert requires you to place a sample in a specified
room, use the special objective tokens from Untold Stories ##1.
Samples are heavy objects.
```
```
If an alert is divided in 2 stages, you must successfully fulfill
the first stage before fulfilling the second (and final) stage, thus
completing the alert.
```
```
When fulfilling the first stage of an alert, mark it by placing any
marker on the green stage icon of the alert card.
```
```
ACTIVATION: Some alerts require performing the new
activation action. This new basic action may only be
performed in the room specified by the slert. It may be
performed both in and out of combat. The activation action has
no other effect other than fulfilling the task described on the
given alert card.
```
#### NEW ROOMS (2)

```
Along with the 4 new rooms, the expansion introduces 3 new
crafted item cards tied to one of the 4 new rooms: the Laser
Pointer, Combat Drone, and Enviro-Suit. These items cannot
be crafted outside of the crafting room, and require different
components than the ones needed to craft the items in the
base game.
```
###### CRAFTING ROOM

```
CRAFT SPECIAL ITEM: When any character in this room
performs the craft item basic action, they may exchange
one of the following items for one of the new crafted items:
```
```
Energy Charge = Laser Pointer
Tools = Combat Drone
Clothes = Enviro-Suit
```
```
The feature of this room does not work if there is a malfunction
marker in the room.
```
###### SERVER ROOM

```
USE ANOTHER COMPUTER: Use the room action of any
discovered, working room with a computer.
```
###### ALARM ROOM

```
MAKE NOISE: Choose any 1 other room without any
character in it. Perform a noise roll there. It may trigger an
encounter, though there will be no surprise attack.
```
###### TURRET ROOM

```
CONTROL TURRETS: Choose any 1 turret token on the
board and change its status. The changed status is placed
facedown on top of the status’ pile.
```
#### TURRETS

```
Place a turret miniature in the room in which its
exploration token was revealed. Turrets cannot be
placed in the nest or in a room covered with slime.
Their starting status is selected at random by shuffling the 3
status tokens and stacking them facedown next to the turret.
The topmost token is the current status of the turret. Turret
status is revealed when entering the room for the first time.
```
```
Turrets can be destroyed with a demolition action. Any
destroyed turret is removed from the board.
```
```
During the fire damage step, intruders always destroy any active
turret in their room. This is simultaneous with turret shooting,
so an intruder may destroy a turret while being killed in the
process.
Ignoring fire damage step does not apply to turrets.
```
###### TURRET STATUS:

######## INACTIVE

```
The turret is inactive and it cannot be destroyed.
```
```
TARGET: ALL
The turret shoots at everything that enters the room
this turn (any intruder spawning in the room counts as
entering it). Turret shooting is resolved during the FIRE DAMAGE
step. Characters receive 1 light wound, intruders receive 1
injury.
```
```
TARGET: INTRUDERS
As TARGET: ALL, but only works on intruders.
```
```
If you want to use turrets in the base game, add the 3 new
exploration tokens with a turret to your exploration token pool
and place the turret miniatures and their status tokens, next to
the board.
```
#### SHUTTLE BOARD

```
The shuttle consists of 4 rooms: the main room is printed on the
board; for the other 3, use randomly chosen additional ##2 room
tiles. The shuttle rooms do not have any item counter, so no item
may be found with the search action here.
```
```
The main room doesn’t have its own room action, though it is
referenced in some of the alerts
```
###### SHUTTLE MOVEMENT

```
When in the main room of the shuttle, a player may move to any
room of the Nemesis ship with a technical corridors entrance.
```
```
When in a room of the Nemesis with a technical corridors
entrance, a player may move to any additional ##2 room of the
shuttle.
```
```
The Nemesis and the shuttle are considered 1 ship for the
purpose of any remote action or rule (affecting another room,
the engines, etc.).
```
#### AFTERMATH EXPLORATION TOKENS

```
LOCKDOWN: Close all doors in corridors connected to
this room, except for the corridor you just used to
enter. If you used the technical corridors to enter,
close all doors in the corridors connected to this room.
```
```
DANGER: As noise roll result.
```

```
```
SLIMED ROOM: Leave this token on the room.
