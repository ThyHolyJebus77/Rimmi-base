   - Each player gets some Command Points (special action tokens)

3. Taking Turns:
   - Players take turns activating one fighter at a time
   - Each fighter can do 2-3 actions like move, shoot, or fight

4. Moving and Shooting:
   - Measure distances with a ruler when moving
   - To shoot, roll dice and compare to the target's defense
   - If you hit, you deal damage

5. Close Combat:
   - When fighters are close, they can fight in melee
   - Both attacker and defender roll dice to see who wins

6. Special Abilities:
   - Each fighter has unique abilities listed on their card
   - Use Command Points to activate powerful team abilities

7. Winning the Game:
   - Score points by completing mission objectives
   - The game lasts 4 rounds

# Warhammer 40K: Kill Team - Rules

## SETUP

Choose open play, matched play, or spec ops narrative play, and
follow the appropriate sequence. The game is played on a 30" x
22" killzone.

Miniatures are called operatives (all your friendly operatives are
collectively called your kill team) and each game round is called
a turning point.

Distances can be measured at any time. When measuring
between operatives, measure from the closest part of their bases.
Something is ‘within’ a range if the closest part of its base is no
more then the specified distance. Something is ‘wholly within’ if
all of its base is no more then the specified distance.

You may never reroll a die more than once. All characteristic
modifiers are cumulative and dice results can be modified above
or below the maximum result possible. Modifications to an
operative’s action point limit (APL) last until the end of its current
or next activation (whichever comes first). The total modification
of an operative’s APL cannot be more than -1 or +1.

Roll off: Each player rolls D6 and the highest roller wins (reroll ties).

Figures are in each other’s engagement range if one of them is
visible to and within of the other.

## BATTLE STRUCTURE

## 1. INITIATIVE PHASE

## 1. READY OPERATIVES

Each player readies all friendly operatives by flipping their order
token to the ready (orange) side.

## 2. DETERMINE INITIATIVE

```
During the first turning point, initiative is
determined in the mission sequence. Subsequently,
roll off to determine initiative; the winner takes the
initiative token. On a tie, the player who did not
have initiative last turning point has the initiative.
```
## 2. STRATEGY PHASE

## 1. GENERATE COMMAND POINTS

Each player adds 1 command point (CP) to their pool (these
remain in your pool until they are spent).

## 2. PLAY STRATEGIC PLOYS

Starting with the player with initiative, players alternate either
using a strategic ploy, or choosing to pass. Repeat this until both
players have passed in succession.

Pay the cost of the strategic ploy in CPs, then resolve its effects
immediately. You cannot use the same strategic ploy more than
once per strategy phase.

## 3. TARGET REVEAL

Starting with the player with initiative, players alternate revealing
tac ops that may be revealed during this step, or choosing to pass.
Repeat this until both players have passed in succession. Players
do not have to reveal a tac op.

## 3. FIREFIGHT PHASE

```
Starting with the player with initiative, players alternate selecting
1 ready friendly operative, activating it, and completing its
actions. Repeat this until all operatives have been activated.
```
```
If an operative has a group activation (GA) of more than 1, it must
be activated in a group. Select ready friendly operatives of the
same type in succession until you have activated GA operatives,
or there are none left to activate. You can never activate more than
2 operatives in the same turning point before your opponent has
had a turn to activate a ready operative or perform overwatch.
```
```
Each time you activate an operative, place an
engage or a conceal order next to it (ready/orange
side). During the first turning point, it will have the
order given to it during setup.
```
```
The operative generates a number of action points (AP) equal to
its action point limit (APL). These are used to perform actions.
Once all AP have been used, their activation ends and they are no
longer ready: flip their order token to its activated (grey) side.
Operatives must pay the AP cost to take an action, and the same
action cannot be performed more than once per activation. While
taking an action, they are the active operative. All of an operative’s
actions do not have to be declared when it is activated.
Free actions do not cost AP and can only performed when their
requirements are met. They still count as performing an action.
Overwatch: On your turn, if you do not have any operatives left to
activate, but your opponent hasn’t yet activated all of theirs, you
can select an already-activated friendly operative with an engage
order to perform 1 overwatch action. While your opponent still
has operatives to activate, each of your operatives can perform 1
overwatch action per turning point.
```
#### NORMAL MOVE (1 AP)

```
Move the operative a number of inches up to its movement (M) in
straight increments (of any length) each direction. An increment
of less than is treated as. M cannot be modified to less than
2 (even if injured).
An operative cannot perform this action if they are within
engagement range of an enemy, or in the same activation in which
they performed a fall back or charge action.
An operative cannot move over another operative’s base,
through terrain features, over the edge of the killzone, or within
engagement range of an enemy unless another friendly operative
is already within engagement range of that enemy (and it cannot
finish its move within engagement range of that enemy). An
operative’s move must end in a location where they can be placed.
If an operative has the FLY keyword, it can move over other
operatives, but cannot finish its move on top of them.
```
#### CHARGE (1 AP)

```
Move the operative in the same way as a normal move a number
of inches up to its M plus. It must finish the move within
engagement range of an enemy operative (if this is not possible
choose a different action instead).
If it moves within engagement range of an enemy and no other
friendly operatives are within engagement range of that enemy,
it must finish the move within engagement range of that enemy.
An operative cannot perform this action if they have the conceal
order, are within engagement range of an enemy, or in the same
activation they performed a normal move, dash, or fall back.
```
#### FALL BACK (2 AP)

```
Move the operative in the same way as a normal move. They can
only perform this action if they are within engagement range of an
enemy. They can move within engagement range of an enemy, but
cannot finish the move within engagement range of an enemy (if
this is not possible choose a different action instead).
```
```
An operative cannot perform this action in the same activation in
which they performed a normal move or charge action.
```
#### DASH (1 AP)

```
Move the operative in the same way as a normal move a number
of inches up to only. An operative cannot perform this action
if they are within engagement range of an enemy, or in the same
activation in which they performed a charge action.
```
#### PASS (1 AP)

```
No effect. Use this action if you wish to do nothing, but have AP
remaining. Operatives can perform this action more than once.
```
#### OVERWATCH (0 AP)

```
Make a shooting attack with one of the operative’s ranged
weapons, worsening their BS by 1.
An operative cannot perform this action if they are within
engagement range of an enemy, and they can only perform it
once per turning point, only if they have an engage order, and only
according to overwatch rules.
```
#### PICK UP (1 AP)

```
The operative must be within of an objective token that can be
picked up. Remove that token from the killzone; the operative is
now carrying it and in control of it.
```
```
An operative cannot perform this action if they are within
engagement range of an enemy, they do not control the objective
token, or if they are already carrying another token.
```
```
An operative can drop a token it is carrying at any point during its
activation for free, and also does so if they are removed from the
killzone. Place the token within of, and visible to, the operative
(or visible and as close as possible if that is not possible).
```
#### SHOOT (1 AP)

```
Make a shooting attack with one of the operative’s ranged
weapons. The operative’s player is the attacker, and the target’s
player is the defender. An operative cannot perform this action if
they have the conceal order, or they are within engagement range
of an enemy.
```
#### FIGHT (1 AP)

```
Fight in combat against an enemy operative. The operative’s
player is the attacker, and the target’s player is the defender.
An operative cannot perform this action unless they are within
engagement range of an enemy.
```
## SHOOT

#### 1. SELECT RANGED WEAPON

```
The attacker selects 1 ranged weapon their operative is equipped
with and takes D6 equal to its ATTACKS (A).
```
#### 2. SELECT VALID TARGET

```
Select an enemy within the active operative’s line of sight (LOS)
that has no friendly operatives in that enemy’s engagement range.
If there are no valid targets, choose a different action instead.
```
#### 3. ATTACKER ROLLS ATTACK DICE

```
Each result that equals or exceeds the weapon’s BALLISTIC SKILL
(BS) is a successful hit and is retained. A 6 is a critical hit and
always successful and a 1 always fails.
```
#### 4. DEFENDER ROLLS DEFENCE DICE

```
Roll D6 equal to the target’s DEFENCE (D). Each result that
equals or exceeds the target’s SAVE (Sv) is a successful save and
is retained. A 6 is a critical save and always successful and a 1
always fails.
If the target is in cover, before rolling their defence dice, they can
retain one as a successful normal save without rolling it.
```
#### 5. DEFENDER RESOLVES SUCCESSFUL SAVES

```
The defender resolves their successful saves. To do so, they
select 1 or more of their retained defence dice, discard 1 of the
attacker’s successful hits, then discard that defence dice.
```
```
If the selected defence dice is a normal save, they select one of
the opponent’s normal hits to be discarded.
```
```
If they select 2 normal saves, they select one of the opponent’s
critical hits to be discarded.
```
```
If the selected defence dice is a critical save, they select one of
the opponent’s normal hits or critical hits to be discarded.
```
#### 6. ATTACKER RESOLVES SUCCESSFUL HITS

```
The attacker resolves remaining successful hits. To do so, they
select 1 of their retained attack dice, inflict damage on the target,
then discard that attack dice.
If the selected attack dice is a normal hit, inflict damage equal to
the weapon’s normal damage (first number).
If the selected attack dice is a critical hit, inflict damage equal to
the weapon’s critical damage (second number).
```
#### 7. REMOVE INCAPACITATED OPERATIVES

```
Any incapacitated operatives are removed from the killzone when
the active operative has resolved all of its shooting attacks for
that action.
```
## FIGHT

#### 1. SELECT VALID TARGET

```
Select an enemy in the active operative’s engagement range.
If there are no valid targets, choose a different action instead.
```
#### 2. SELECT MELEE WEAPONS

```
The attacker selects 1 melee weapon their operative is equipped
with and takes D6 equal to its ATTACKS (A).
```
```
The defender does the same.
```
#### 3. ROLL ATTACK DICE

```
Both players roll their attack dice simultaneously.
```
```
Each result that equals or exceeds your weapon’s WEAPON SKILL
(WS) is a successful hit and is retained. A 6 is a critical hit and
always successful and a 1 always fails.
```
```
For each other friendly operative that supports your operative
in the combat, improve the WS by 1. The supporting operative
must be within engagement range of the enemy operative and not
within engagement range of other enemy operatives.
```
#### 6. RESOLVE SUCCESSFUL HITS

```
Starting with the attacker, each player alternates resolving 1 of
their successful hits. Repeat this until one of the operatives is
incapacitated or you have no more hits to resolve (in which case
your opponent resolves their remaining hits).
```
```
To resolve a hit, select 1 of your retained attack dice, choose for
your operative to strike or parry, then discard that attack dice.
```
```
If you parry, one of your opponent’s successful hits is discarded.
```
```
If the selected attack dice is a normal hit, select one of your
opponent’s normal hits to be discarded.
```
```
If the selected attack dice is a critical hit, select one of your
opponent’s normal hits or critical hits to be discarded.
```
```
If you strike, inflict damage on the target.
If the selected attack dice is a normal hit, inflict damage equal
to the weapon’s normal damage (first number).
```
```
If the selected attack dice is a critical hit, inflict damage equal
to the weapon’s critical damage (second number).
```

## WOUNDS AND DAMAGE

Each time an operative is damaged, it loses a number of WOUNDS
(W) equal to the damage’s value. Mark lost wounds with a token or
similar. If wounds are reduced to 0, the operative is incapacitated
and removed from the killzone.

Each time an operative suffers a mortal wound, 1 point of damage
is applied to it (defence dice do not help).

```
An operative with fewer than half of its wounds remaining is
injured. Subtract from its M, and worsen the BS and WS of
the weapons it uses by 1.
```
## TACTICAL PLOYS

CPs may be spent on tactical ploys specific to a faction’s army
list. Each player can use each tactical ploy no more than once per
turning point.

The following tactical ploy is available to all factions and may be
used more than once per turning point.

#### COMMAND RE-ROLL (1 CP)

Use this tactical ploy to re-roll 1 attack dice or defence dice.

## OBJECTIVES

Friendly operatives control an objective if the total APL of friendly
operatives within of the centre of it is greater than that of
enemy operatives. Measure to and from the centre of an objective.
An operative carrying an objective token is always in control of it.

## LINE OF SIGHT

```
If the intended target has an engage order, it is in the
active operative’s LOS if it is visible and not obscured.
```
```
If the intended target has a conceal order, it is in the
active operative’s LOS if it is visible, not obscured,
and not in cover.
```
#### VISIBLE

For an intended target to be visible, you must be able to draw an
unobstructed straight visibility line from the active operative’s
head to any part of the intended target except its base (or
a selected point on the killzone if that is required). If a base
prevents a target from being visible, treat the base as being
invisible.

#### COVER

Draw cover lines from any part of the active operative’s base
to every part of the intended target’s base. To be in cover, the
intended target must be more than from the active operative,
and within of a point at which a cover line crosses another
operative’s base or a terrain feature that provides cover.

#### OBSCURED

For an intended target to be obscured, the intended target must
be more than from a point at which a cover line crosses a
terrain feature that is obscuring. However, if the active operative
is within of that point, that part of the terrain feature is not
treated as obscuring.

## TERRAIN TRAITS

```
HEAVY terrain provides cover and is obscuring.
```
```
LIGHT terrain provides cover unless otherwise specified.
```
```
TRAVERSABLE terrain can be traversed.
```
```
INSIGNIFICANT terrain has no impact on the rules.
```
```
BARRICADES are wide and tall and are light and traversable.
VANTAGE POINTS are terrain with a vertical element that operatives
can be placed upon. An operative cannot finish a move or be set
upon a part of a terrain feature that is not a VANTAGE POINT.
```
```
When an operative on a VANTAGE POINT makes a shooting attack,
each enemy with a conceal order, in cover provided by light
terrain or another operative, and at least lower than them, is
treated as having an engage order for that attack instead.
```
```
If a shooting attack is made against an operative on a VANTAGE
POINT, the target cannot use the floor of the vantage point as cover
or to be obscured, nor can they use parts of the vantage point’s
feature that are lower than them as cover or to be obscured. They
can however use parts that are the same height or higher, such as
a rampart or battlement.
```
#### WALL All parts have the heavy trait.

#### LOW WALL All parts have the light and traversable traits.

#### PIPES Pipes have the light and traversable traits.

#### BATTLEFIELD DETRITUS These features, such as crates, are

```
usually less than tall, and have the insignificant trait.
```
#### KILLZONE MATERIEL These features, such as stacked crates

```
and oil drums, have the light trait. They can also be traversable if
they are no more than tall.
```
#### INDUSTRIAL MACHINE All parts have the heavy trait.

#### OTHER FEATURES Buildings and structures, trees, and

```
containers can include parts with different traits.
```
## MOVING THROUGH TERRAIN

#### TRAVERSE

```
During a move, an operative may ascend and descend terrain with
the TRAVERSABLE trait at a cost of , but cannot finish a move on
top of it. If this is not possible, it must move around it instead. This
is not a climb, but a horizontal move over an obstacle.
```
#### JUMP

```
An operative may jump a gap between terrain that is within
horizontally and vertically from one edge to the other. The
operative must be within of the edge of the gap.
```
```
Take a jump test by rolling D6: on 1, the test is unsuccessful,
the operative remains where it is, and that action ends; and on
2+ you can move the operative across the gap.
```
```
Only the horizontal distance counts towards how far the operative
has moved. An operative cannot jump instead of climbing.
```
```
The operative must be able to end their move in a location where
it can be placed; if it cannot, it cannot attempt the jump.
```
#### CLIMB

```
An operative may ascend or descend a terrain feature that it
cannot traverse. The operative must be within of a climbable
part of the feature (wall, pipe, chain etc), and may then climb
it, counting the distance it travels towards the total distance it
moves, rounding up any incremental distances of less than
to.
The operative must be able to end their move in a location where
it can be placed; if it cannot, it cannot begin the climb (though
they may perform a dash action during a climb).
```
#### DROP

```
An operative may descend a height without climbing. The
operative must be within of the edge of the terrain feature it
will drop from, and the intended location must be vertically within
3 of the level it occupies.
It then drops, counting the vertical distance it travels towards the
total distance it moves, rounding down any incremental distances
of more than to (so a total vertical distance of is ignored).
```
```
An operative cannot move through any part of another operative’s
base (unless it can FLY), so it cannot make the drop if the
intended location has any operatives that would prevent the
operative moving in that direction.
```
#### FLYING

```
Operatives with the FLY keyword ignore vertical distances when
moving on or over terrain features, so do not need to climb or
traverse and can move freely across gaps.
When they drop, their intended location can be any vertical
distance and the vertical distance they travel does not count
towards their move.
```
## TAC OPS

```
Tac ops are secondary objectives you can achieve to earn victory
points (VPs). The mission sequence will specify what category of
tac op you can use and how to select from that category. Tac ops
are kept secret until revealed, and specify when they should be
revealed.
```
```
You can score VPs from each of their 2 conditions once, and you
cannot score VPs from a condition before that tac op is revealed.
```
## CLOSE QUARTERS

## ACTIONS

#### GUARD (1 AP)

```
This action is treated as a shoot action. The operative goes on
guard until it performs a guard attack or any actions (including
pass); or an enemy operative ends an action within engagement
range of it and does not make a guard attack; or its order is
changed to conceal; or it is the end of the turning point.
The operative cannot perform this action if it has a conceal order
or while within engagement range of an enemy operative.
On guard: Once during each enemy’s activation, after that enemy
performs a normal action, you can interrupt it and select 1
friendly operative on guard to make 1 of these guard attacks: an
overwatch action, a free fight action, or point-blank overwatch.
Point-blank overwatch is an overwatch action while within
engagement range of the enemy operative that is its target. Until
the end of the interrupted enemy operative’s activation, each time
the friendly operative fights, do not select melee weapons or roll
attack dice for it during that combat.
If an enemy operative has its activation interrupted by a guard
attack, is incapacitated and subsequently revived, its activation
immediately ends.
```
#### HATCHWAY FIGHT (1 AP)

```
This action is treated as a fight action. An operative can perform
this action if it is not within engagement range of an enemy
operative, and its base is touching an open hatchway’s access
point, and an enemy operative is blocking that access point (by
bring on the other side and within of it).
Fight in combat against an enemy operative blocking that access
point. That operative is a valid target.
```
#### OPERATE HATCH (1 AP)

```
An operative can perform this action while within of a
hatchway’s access point to open or close that hatchway. They
cannot do so while within engagement range of an enemy
operative, or if that hatchway is open and an enemy operative is
within of its access point.
An operative can perform this action during a dash or normal
move action, and may use any remaining increments of
movement after it does so. The move action would usually
end if opening the hatchway caused the operative to be within
engagement range of an enemy operative, however.
```
## CONDENSED ENVIRONMENT

```
Weapons with the Blast x, Splash x, and/or Torrent x special rules
gain the Lethal 5+ special rule.
Each time a friendly operative makes a shooting attack with a
weapon with the Indirect special rule, you must choose whether
or not to use that rule. If you do, that weapon gains the Rng
special rule for that shooting attack.
```
```
Each time a friendly operative makes a shooting attack against
an enemy operative , if a cover line drawn to that target crosses 1
or more operatives with an engage order (excluding those with a
WOUNDS of 5 or less, and friendly operatives whose bases touch
the active operative’s), roll 1 less attack dice.
```
## TAC OPS

```
Do not use these tac ops: Seize Ground, Hold the Line, Sabotage,
and Vantage. If this would mean you cannot build a 6-card
tac ops deck, you can select the number of cards needed to
complete your deck from one of the other archetypes your kill
team has access to (in matched play, if they do not have any other
archetypes, you can select the needed cards from any 1 other
archetype).
```
## TERRAIN

#### BARRICADES Barricades can be set up anywhere in the killzone

```
that is more than from your opponent’s dropzone, more than
from access points, more than from other barricades, and
not on a terrain feature (unless it has the insignificant trait).
```
#### WALL All parts of a wall have the heavy and wall traits. Operatives

```
cannot move over or through walls, other than as a result of the
accessible trait. Visibility lines cannot be drawn over or through
them, and an operative is never a valid target if every cover line
drawn to it crosses walls. Range cannot be measure over or
through walls (measure around it using the shortest route). A
cover line must cross a corner or end of a wall for it to provide
cover or be obscuring.
```
#### HATCHWAY Hatchways begin the battle closed: the hatch is fully

```
within its access point, and all parts of it have the heavy and wall
traits.
```
```
While a hatchway is open, its hatch must be fully open, its access
point has the accessible trait, and its hatch has the wall trait.
```
```
Accessible: An operative can move through walls up to
adjacent to this access point as if they were not there, as long as
at least part of its base moves through this access point when it
does so. It must finish a move wholly on one side or the other of
this terrain feature.
```
#### ANCIENT APPARATUS Ancient apparatus features have

```
the heavy and traversable traits. Some missions treat them as
objective markers. A friendly operative controls one while within
of it, and if the total APL of friendly operatives within of it is
greater than that of enemy operatives within of it.
```
#### PIPES Pipes have the insignificant traits. Broken pipes have the

```
light and traversable traits.
```

Figures are in each other’s engagement range (ER) if one of
them is visible to and within of the other.

## 1. INITIATIVE PHASE

#### 1. READY ALL OPERATIVES

#### 2. ROLL OFF TO DETERMINE INITIATIVE

On a tie, the player who did not have initiative last has initiative.

## 2. STRATEGY PHASE

#### 1. EACH PLAYER RECEIVES 1 CP

#### 2. PLAY STRATEGIC PLOYS

Player with initiative first, players alternate playing strategic
ploys. You cannot use the same one more than once.

#### 3. TARGET REVEAL

Starting with the player with initiative, players alternate playing
relevant tac ops cards.

## 3. FIREFIGHT PHASE

Player with initiative first, players alternate activating a ready
operative; repeat until all activated. Those with GA 2+ activate in
a group. To activate, place an engage or a conceal order token,
take actions (spend AP up to APL), then flip the order token.

#### COMMAND RE-ROLL TACTICAL PLOY (1 CP)

Re-roll 1 attack dice or defence dice.

#### NORMAL MOVE (1 AP)

Move up to M. Less than is. An operative cannot perform
this action if they are within ER of an enemy, or in the same
activation in which they performed a fall back or charge action.

An operative cannot move over another’s base, or within ER of
an enemy unless another friendly is already within ER of that
enemy (and it cannot finish its move within ER of that enemy).

#### CHARGE (1 AP)

Make a normal move up to M plus. The move must end within
ER of an enemy. If it moves within ER of an enemy and no other
friendly operatives are within ER of that enemy, it must finish
the move within ER of that enemy.

An operative cannot perform this action if they have the conceal
order, they are within ER of an enemy, or in the same activation
as a normal move, dash, or fall back action.

#### FALL BACK (2 AP)

Make a normal move. An operative can only fall back if they are
within ER of an enemy. They can move within ER of an enemy,
but cannot finish the move within ER of an enemy.

An operative cannot perform this action in the same activation
in which they performed a normal move or charge action.

#### DASH (1 AP)

Make a normal move up to only. An operative cannot perform
this action if they are within ER of an enemy, or in the same
activation as a charge action.

#### PASS (1 AP)

value if several apply.

Barrage: When shooting this weapon, instead of the normal
retention of defence dice due to cover, if any part of the target
operative’s base is hidden by a terrain feature from directly
above, the defender can retain defence dice as if in cover.

Balanced: Each time the operative fights in combat or shoots
with this weapon, you can reroll one of your attack dice.

Blast x: After shooting this weapon, make a shooting attack
(using the same profile) against each other operative within x of
the original target. When determining if these other operatives
are valid targets or in cover, treat the original target as the active
operative. You cannot shoot this weapon using overwatch.

Brutal: Each time the operative fights in combat with this
weapon, your opponent can only parry with critical hits.

Ceaseless: When the operative fights in combat or shoots with
this weapon, you can reroll any or all your attack dice results of 1.

this operative, the defender can use its invulnerable save
instead of its normal SAVE. It cannot be modified in any way,
and is not affected by any APx special rules.

Lethal x: When the operative fights in combat or shoots with this
weapon, your attack dice results of equal to or greater than x
that are successful hits are critical hits.

Limited: This weapon can only be used once per battle. If it has
a special rule that allows it to make more than 1 shooting attack
for an action, make each of those attacks as normal.

critical hits, the weapon gains the APx special rule for that
shooting attack.

Range (Rng x): When shooting this weapon, only operatives
within x are a valid target (all other rules for selecting a valid
target still apply).

Reap x: When fighting in combat with this weapon, if you strike

shoot actions if this is the ranged weapon (or profile) that is
selected for the shooting attack(s).
Splash x: When shooting this weapon, for each critical hit
retained, inflict x mortal wounds on the target and each other
operative visible to and within of it.
Stun: When shooting this weapon, if you retain any critical hits,
subtract 1 from the target’s APL. Each time you fight in combat
with this weapon, the first time you critical hit, select one of your
opponent’s normal hits to be discarded, and the second time
you critical hit, subtract 1 from the target’s APL.
```
```
Torrent x: After making a shoot or overwatch action with this
weapon, make a shooting attack with this weapon against each
other valid target within x of the original target and each other.
Unwieldy: An operative can only shoot this weapon if an extra

## TERRAIN

```
HEAVY terrain provides cover and is obscuring.
LIGHT terrain provides cover unless otherwise specified.
BARRICADES are wide and tall, light and traversable.
VANTAGE POINTS When shooting from a vantage point, each
enemy with a conceal order, in light terrain cover, and at least
lower than them, is treated as having an engage order. When
shooting at an operative on a vantage point, that operative cannot
use the floor or parts of the terrain lower than them as cover or
to be obscured.
```
#### TRAVERSE Ascend/descend traversable terrain at a cost of ,

```
An operative cannot stop on top of such terrain.
```
#### JUMP Jump a gap within horizontally and vertically from

one edge to the other. Must be within of an edge. Roll D6: on
1, the operative remains where it is and that action ends; on 2+
move across the gap (only the horizontal distance counts).
```
#### CLIMB Ascend/descend a terrain feature. Must be within of

```
a climbable part; then climb it, counting the distance travelled

```
of the edge of the terrain, and the intended location must be
vertically within 3 of the level occupied. Then drop, counting
the vertical distance they travel towards the total move distance,
rounding down more than to.
```
## LINE OF SIGHT

```
If the intended target has an engage order, it is in the operative’s

LOS if it is visible, not obscured, and not in cover.
```
#### VISIBLE Must be able to draw an unobstructed line from the

```
active operative’s head to any part of the target (not its base).
```
#### IN COVER Draw cover lines from any part of the operative’s

base to every part of the target’s base. Target must be more
than away, and within of where a cover line crosses
another operative’s base or a terrain feature that provides cover.
```
#### OBSCURED Target must be more than from the point where

## TERRAIN

```
HEAVY terrain provides cover and is obscuring.
LIGHT terrain provides cover unless otherwise specified.
BARRICADES are wide and tall, light and traversable.
VANTAGE POINTS When shooting from a vantage point, each
enemy with a conceal order, in light terrain cover, and at least
lower than them, is treated as having an engage order. When
shooting at an operative on a vantage point, that operative cannot
use the floor or parts of the terrain lower than them as cover or
to be obscured.
```
#### TRAVERSE Ascend/descend traversable terrain at a cost of ,

```
An operative cannot stop on top of such terrain.
```
#### JUMP Jump a gap within horizontally and vertically from

```
one edge to the other. Must be within of an edge. Roll D6: on
1, the operative remains where it is and that action ends; on 2+
move across the gap (only the horizontal distance counts).
```
#### CLIMB Ascend/descend a terrain feature. Must be within of

```
a climbable part; then climb it, counting the distance travelled
towards the total move distance, rounding up less than to.
May perform a dash action during a climb.
```
#### DROP Drop to descend a height without climbing. Must be within

```
of the edge of the terrain, and the intended location must be
vertically within 3 of the level occupied. Then drop, counting
the vertical distance they travel towards the total move distance,
rounding down more than to.
```
## LINE OF SIGHT

```
If the intended target has an engage order, it is in the operative’s
LOS if it is visible and not obscured.
```
```
If the intended target has a conceal order, it is in the operative’s
LOS if it is visible, not obscured, and not in cover.
```
#### VISIBLE Must be able to draw an unobstructed line from the

```
active operative’s head to any part of the target (not its base).
```
#### IN COVER Draw cover lines from any part of the operative’s

```
base to every part of the target’s base. Target must be more
than away, and within of where a cover line crosses
another operative’s base or a terrain feature that provides cover.
```
#### OBSCURED Target must be more than from the point where

```
a cover line crosses a terrain feature that is obscuring. If the
active operative is within of that point, that part of the terrain
feature is not treated as obscuring.
