## Quick Start Rules Guide

1. Setup: 
   - Form two teams, each with a spymaster and field operatives.
   - Place 25 word cards in a 5x5 grid on the table.
   - Spymasters sit on one side, field operatives on the other.
   - Spymasters draw a key card showing which words belong to each team.

2. Objective:
   - Be the first team to identify all your words on the grid.
   - Avoid guessing the assassin word, which causes an instant loss.

3. Gameplay:
   - Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues to their team.
   - Clue format: "Word: Number" (e.g., "Tree: 2")
   - The number indicates how many words relate to the clue.

4. Guessing:
   - After receiving a clue, field operatives discuss and touch words they think match.
   - If correct, cover the word with your team's agent card and continue guessing.
   - If wrong, your turn ends immediately.
   - You can always guess one more word than the number given in the clue.

5. Turn End:
   - Your turn ends when you guess incorrectly or choose to stop.
   - The other team then takes their turn.

6. Winning:
   - First team to cover all their words wins.
   - Guessing the assassin word results in an immediate loss for that team.

7. Key Rules:
   - Clues must be one word only.
   - Don't use any form of a word visible on the table.
   - Spymasters must remain poker-faced during guessing.

Remember, have fun and be creative with your clues!

# Codenames - Rules

[[Codenames.pdf]]

SETUP Players split up into two teams of similar
size  and  skill.  You  need  at  least  four players (two teams of two) for astandard game. Variants for two or three players can be found on the back page.
Each  team  chooses  one  player  to  be their spymaster. Both spymasters sit on the same side of the table. The other players sit across from their spymasters. They are field operatives.
Randomly  choose  25  codenames  and place them on the table in a 5-by-5 grid.
Note:  While  shuffling  the  codename cards, be sure to flip over half the deck once in awhile. This will mix the words more thoroughly.





field operatives








spymasters

THE KEY
Each game has one key that reveals the secret identities of the cards on the table. The spymasters should choose the key card randomly and slide it into the stand between them. Any side can be up. Don't think about it. Just slide it into the stand. And don't let the field operatives see it.










The key corresponds to the grid on the table. Blue squares correspond to words that Blue Team must guess (blue agents). Red squares correspond to words that Red Team must guess (red agents). Pale squares are innocent bystanders, and the black square is an assassin who should never be contacted at all!
2
STARTING TEAM
The four lights around the edge of the key card indicate which team starts. The starting team has 9words to guess. The other team has8. The starting team will give the first clue of the game.


AGENT CARDS 8red agents








1double agent






7innocent
bystanders



8blue agents
















1assassin




The red agent cards go in a stack in front of the red spymaster. The blue agent cards should be in front of the blue  spymaster.  This  helps  everyone remember which team they are on.




The double agent belongs to whichever team starts. Flip it to that team's color. It will be one of that team'sagent cards for the duration of the game.




The innocent bystander cards and the assassin  should  be  kept  in  between, where both spymasters can reach them easily.






GAME OVERVIEW
Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames.
Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues. A clue may relate to multiple words on the table. Thefield operatives try to guess which words their spymaster meant. When afield operative touches aword, the spymaster reveals its secret identity. If it is one of their team'sagents, the operatives may keep guessing. Otherwise, it is the other team's turn. The first team to contact all their agents wins the game.

GAME PLAY
Teams take turns. The starting team is indicated by the 4lights on the edges of the key card.
GIVING ACLUE
If you are the spymaster, you are trying to think of aone-word clue that relates to some of the words your team is trying to guess. When you think you have a good clue, you say it. You also say one number, which tells your teammates how many codenames are related to your clue.
Example: Two of your words are NUT and BARK. Both of these grow on trees, so you say tree: 2.
You are allowed to give aclue for only one word (cashew: 1) but it'sfun to try for two or more. Getting four words with one clue is abig accomplishment.
One Word
Your clue must be only one word. You are not allowed to give extra hints. For example, don't say, "This may be abit of astretch…" You are playing Codenames. It'salways abit of astretch.
Your clue cannot be any of the codenames visible on the table. On later turns, some codenames will be covered up, so aclue that is not legal now might be legal later.
MAKING CONTACT
When the spymaster gives aclue, his or her field operatives try to figure out what it means. They can debate it amongst themselves, but the spymaster must keep a straight face. The operatives indicate their official guess when one of them touches one of the codenames on the table.
•	If the field operative touches acard belonging to his or her team, the spymaster covers the word with an agent card in that color. The team may guess another word.
•	If the field operative touches an innocent bystander, the spymaster covers it with an innocent bystander card. This ends the turn.
•	If the field operative touches acard belonging to the other team, the word is covered by one of the other team'sagent cards.This ends the turn. (And it helps the other team.)
•	If the field operative touches the assassin, the word is covered by the assassin card. This ends the game!The team that contacted the assassin loses.
Tip: Before saying your clue out loud, make sure it doesn't relate to the assassin. Number of Guesses
The  field  operatives  must  always  make  at  least  one  guess.  Any  wrong  guess  ends  the  turn immediately, but if the field operatives guess aword of their team'scolor, they can keep guessing.
You can stop guessing at any time, but usually you want to guess as many words as the spymaster said. Sometimes you might even want to guess one more:
Example: Red Team's first clue was tree: 2. The red operative wanted to guess ORANGE and NUT. Sheguessed ORANGE first. That was an innocent bystander, so she did not get achance to guess NUT.
Blue Team took aturn and correctly guessed two words. Now it is Red Team'sturn again.
The red spymaster says river: 3. The red operative is pretty sure the AMAZON is ariver, so she touches that card. The spymaster covers it with a red agent card, so she gets to go again. A river has a BED, so she touches that codename. It'salso red, so she can go again.

PENALTY FOR INVALID CLUES

She'snot sure of the third river word. She picks NUT. This has nothing to do with river. She is guessing aword from the previous clue.
NUT is a red word. The operative has made 3 correct guesses for the clue river: 3. She is allowed one final guess. She can try to find the thirdriver word, or she can try to find the other tree word. Or she can stop at three and let Blue Team have aturn.
You are allowed only one extra guess. In the example  above,  the  red  operative  would  be allowed 4 guesses because her spymaster said the number 3. When the field operatives say they are done guessing (or when they guess wrong) it is the other team'sturn.
GAME FLOW
Spymasters take turns giving clues. Each turn covers  up  at  least  one  word,  which  makes guessing progressively easier.
ENDING THE GAME
The game ends when one team has all their words covered. That team wins.
It is possible to win on the other team's turn if they guess your last word.
The game can end early if a field operative makes    contact    with    the    assassin.    That operative'steam loses.
Setup for the Next Game
Do   other   people   want   a   chance   to   be spymasters?   Setup   for   the   second   game is   easy.   Remove   the   cards   covering   the codenames and put them back in their stacks. Now  just  flip  over  the  25  codenames,  and you're ready to go!

If  a  spymaster  gives  an  invalid  clue,  the team'sturn ends immediately. As an additional penalty, the other team'sspymaster may cover one of his or her words with an agent card before giving the next clue.
But if no one notices that a clue is invalid, it counts as valid.


KEEPING ASTRAIGHT FACE The spymaster is expected to keep a straight face. Do not reach for any card while your teammates are considering the words. When a teammate touches a word, consult the key card  and  cover  the  word  with  the  card  of the corresponding color. When a teammate chooses  a  word  of  the  correct  color,  you should act as though it was exactly the word you meant, even if it wasn't.
If you are a field operative, you should focus on  the  table  when  you  are  making  your guesses. Do not make eye contact with the spymaster while you are guessing. This will help you avoid nonverbal cues.
When  your  information  is  strictly  limited  to what can be conveyed with one word and one number, you are playing in the spirit of the game.


WHAT'STHE TIMER FOR? Sorry. We almost forgot. You see, we don't use the sand timer very often.
If a player is thinking too long, any player can flip the sand timer and ask the slow player to make adecision before time runs out.
If you are having trouble, you can even use the sand timer on yourself. If you can't find a good clue before time runs out, just give aclue for your hardest word and keep thinking while the other team plays.

VALID CLUES
We playtested various rules. Some groups like the rules one way. Some like the rules another way. Youshould experiment to find out what your group likes.


FIRM RULES
Some clues are invalid because they violate the spirit of the game.
Your clue must be about the meaning of the words. You can't use your clue to talk about the letters in aword or its position on the table. Gland is not a valid clue for ENGLAND. You can't tie BUG, BED, and BOW together with a clue like b: 3 nor with a clue like three: 3. However…
Letters and numbers are valid clues, as long as they refer to meanings. You can use X: 1as a clue for RAY. You can use eight: 3 as a clue for BALL, FIGURE, and OCTOPUS.
The number you say after your clue can't be used as a clue. Citrus: 8 is not a valid clue for LEMON and OCTOPUS.
You must play in English. A foreign word is allowed only if the players in your group would use  it  in  an  English  sentence.  For  example, you can't use Apfel as a clue for APPLE and BERLIN, but you can use strudel.
You  can't  say  any  form  of  a  visible  word on the table. Until BREAK is covered up by a card, you can't say break, broken, breakage, or breakdown.
You can't say part of acompound word on the table. Until HORSESHOE is covered up, you can't say horse, shoe, unhorsed, or snowshoe.

HOMONYMS & SPELLING English has a lot of homonyms. For example, night sounds like knight, but these two words don't mean the same thing.
Same-sounding	words	with	different meanings	and	different    spellings	are considered different words. So you can't give knight-related clues for NIGHT.
Words   that   are   spelled   the   same   are considered the same even though they might have  different  pronunciations  and  meanings. For example, actors take abow and the bow is part of a ship, so you could use bow as a clue for THEATER and SHIP. You could also use it as a clue for archery-related things, even though thatbow is pronounced differently.
You are allowed to spell out your clue. For example, if you want your teammates to guess THEATER and STRING, you can spell out b-o-w without committing to apronunciation. You can give the clue k-n-i-g-h-t even when NIGHT is one of the codenames on the table. (But you can't use t-h-e-a-t-r-e when THEATER is on the  table.  Theatre  and  theater  are  different forms of the same word.)
You should spell out your clue if someone asks. If you aren't that strong on spelling, ask the opposing spymaster for help.
Tip: Spelling is not just for homonyms. It'salso useful when the room is noisy or when the players have very different accents.


DON'T BE TOO STRICT
England and island were originally compound words, but in this century, island is a valid clue for ENGLAND. Even land is avalid clue for ENGLAND. And anybody who says you can't say sparrow when ROW is on the table is just trying to cause trouble.
If the opposing spymaster allows it, the clue is valid. If you aren't sure, ask your opponent. (Quietly, so the others can't hear.)
6
FLEXIBLE RULES

Sometimes  you  have  to  make  judgment  calls about what is valid and what is not. Different groups may prefer to play the game differently.
Compound Words
English  has  three  ways  to  write  a  compound word. Greenhouse is one word. Pack rat is two words.Mother-in-law is hyphenated. Technically, onlygreenhouse can be aone-word clue.
You can decide to allow any compound words. However, in no case should a player be allowed to invent compound words. Lunar squid is not avalid clue for MOON and OCTOPUS.
Proper Names
Proper  names  are  always  valid  clues  if  they follow the other rules. George is avalid clue, but you might want to specify whether you mean George  Washington  or  George  W.  Bush.  Your group can agree to count proper names as one word. This would also allow titles such as The Three Musketeers. Even if you don't allow multi-word proper names, you might want to make an exception for place names like New York.
Spymasters should not be allowed to make up names,  not  even  names  that  turn  out  to  be real. Sue Mee is not a valid clue for CHINA and LAWYER.



EXPERT CLUE: ZERO You are allowed to use 0 as the number part of your clue. For example, feathers:0means, "None of our words relate to feathers."
If 0 is the number, the usual limit on guesses does  not  apply.  Field  operatives  can  guess as many words as they want. They still must guess at least one word.
If  you're  not  sure  why  this  is  useful,  don't worry. You'll figure it out.

Acronyms and Abbreviations Technically,  CIA  is  not  one  word.  But  it  is a great clue. You can decide to allow common abbreviations like UK, lol, and PhD. And words like laser, radar, and sonar are always allowed, even though they originated as acronyms.
Homonyms
Some people prefer to allow a more liberal use of homonyms. You can allow knight to be aclue for night-related things if that makes the game more fun for you.
Rhymes
Rhymes  are  always  valid  when  they  refer  to meanings. Snail is a valid clue for MAIL because this  rhyme  is  a  common  phrase.  Snail  is  also a valid clue for WHALE because they are both animals.  Snail  is  not  a  valid  clue  for  SCALE because  their  main  association  is  through  the sound of the words. (If someone in your group has a job weighing snails, however, this clue is perfectly fine.)
Some people like to allow any kind of rhyming clue. If you decide to allow this, just remember that you aren't allowed to indicate you are giving a  rhyming  clue.  Your  operatives  will  have  to figure that out for themselves.



EXPERT CLUE: UNLIMITED Sometimes you may have multiple unguessed words  related  to  clues  from  the  previous rounds. If you want your team to guess more than  one  of  them,  you  may  say  unlimited instead of a number. For example feathers: unlimited.
The disadvantage is that the field operatives do not know how many words are related to the new clue. The advantage is that they may guess as many words as they want.


7
TWO-PLAYER GAME
If there are only two of you, you can play on the same team. This two-player variant also works for larger groups of people who don't feel like competing against each other. You will try to get a high score against asimulated opponent.
Set up the game as usual. One player will be the spymaster and the rest will be field operatives. Theother team has no players, but you still need their stack of agent cards.

Your team should go first, so be sure to pick a key card that makes you the starting team.
Play your turns as usual. Try to avoid enemy agents and the assassin.
The spymaster simulates the enemy team by covering up 1 of their words each time they get a turn. The spymaster gets to choose which word is covered, so there is abit of strategy here.
If your team contacts the assassin, or if all the enemy agents are contacted, you lose. There is no score.
If your team wins, give yourselves ascore based on how many agent cards are still left in the enemy'sstack.


8    That is … difficult to believe.

7    Mission impossible.

6    Wow!

5    MI6 will be giving you acall.

4    Top secret clearance.

3    Your watches are synchronized.

2    Okay. But you can do better.

1	Well, awin is awin, right?

Note: Your score will be determined by how many turns you needed and also by how many enemy agents you contacted accidentally.


THREE-PLAYER GAME
Three players who want to be on the same team can play as described above. If two players want to compete against each other, they can be spymasters and the third player can be their operative.
Setup and game play are as usual, except that the single field operative is working for both sides. (Just like spies in real life!) The winning spymaster is determined in the usual way. The field operative tries to do agood job for both sides.
