## Quick Start Rules Guide
## Quick Start Rules Guide

Welcome to Kemet! This guide will help you and your friends dive into the game quickly and easily. Follow these steps to set up and start playing.

### 1. Setup

1. **Board Setup**:
   - Place the game board in the center of the table. Use the side that corresponds to the number of players (2-3 players use one side, 4-5 players use the other).

2. **Components**:
   - **Power Tiles**: Arrange the power tiles by color (ruby, sapphire, diamond) and level (1 to 4) next to the board.
   - **Creature Miniatures**: Place each creature miniature on its corresponding power tile.
   - **Divine Intervention Cards**: Shuffle and place them face down to form a deck.
   - **Victory Point Tokens**: Place them in a general supply accessible to all players.

3. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding components: 12 unit miniatures, 5 action tokens, 1 prayer marker, 1 individual board, 1 order marker, 6 battle cards, and 3 pyramids (one of each color: ruby, sapphire, diamond).
   - Place your prayer marker on the "7" space of your prayer track.
   - Draw 2 divine intervention cards.

4. **City and Troop Placement**:
   - Each player selects a city on the board as their starting location.
   - Place 5 units in two different districts of your city and keep the remaining 2 units in your supply.

5. **Turn Order**:
   - Randomly determine the turn order by placing order markers on the turn order track.

6. **Pyramid Points Distribution**:
   - In turn order, distribute 3 level points among your pyramids (options: 1/1/1 or 2/1/0) and place them in your city.

### 2. Turn Structure

Each round consists of a Day Phase, Night Phase, and Dawn Phase.

#### Day Phase

1. **Action Tokens**:
   - In turn order, place one of your action tokens on an empty action space on your individual board and resolve the action immediately.
   - Continue until all players have placed their 5 action tokens.

2. **Available Actions**:
   - **Pray**: Gain 2 prayer points.
   - **Raise a Pyramid**: Spend prayer points to increase the level of one of your pyramids.
   - **Buy a Power Tile**: Acquire a power tile by spending prayer points and meeting pyramid level requirements.
   - **Recruit**: Spend prayer points equal to the amount of units to add to your city.
   - **Move**: Move your troops across the board to control areas or engage in battles.

#### Night Phase

1. **Resolution Steps**:
   - **Offering**: The player controlling the Sanctuary of All Gods may remove 2 units to gain 1 Sanctuary VP.
   - **Delta Control**: The player controlling the delta Temple may remove 1 unit to gain 5 prayer points.
   - **Temples Control**: Gain 1 Control VP if you control at least 2 temples.
   - **Adoration**: Gain prayer points based on the temples you control.
   - **Prayer**: Each player gains 2 prayer points.
   - **Divine Intervention**: Draw 1 divine intervention card in turn order.
   - **Awakening**: Retrieve your action tokens.

#### Dawn Phase

1. **End of Game Check**:
   - If a player has 9 victory points, the game ends after this phase. The player with the most victory points wins.

2. **Turn Order**:
   - Re-establish turn order based on the number of victory points, with the player having the least points choosing first.

### 3. Key Concepts

- **Victory Points**: Earned through battles, controlling temples, and other achievements. The first player to reach 9 victory points triggers the end of the game.
- **Battles**: Resolved using unit strength, battle cards, and divine intervention cards. The player with the highest strength wins.
- **Prayer Points**: Used to perform actions and acquire power tiles. Manage them wisely to maximize your strategic options.

### 4. Additional Tips

- **Strategic Planning**: Balance your actions between building your forces, acquiring power tiles, and engaging in battles.
- **Engagement**: Kemet encourages aggressive play, so don't hesitate to challenge your opponents and seize control of key areas.
- **Adaptability**: Be ready to adjust your strategy based on the actions of other players and the power tiles you acquire.

With these rules, you're ready to embark on your journey to become the most powerful god in Kemet. Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!

## Additional Rules and Tips for New Players

To help new players get a better grasp of Kemet and enhance their gaming experience, here are some additional rules and tips:

### Understanding the Game Flow

- **Phases Overview**: Familiarize yourself with the sequence of phases (Day, Night, Dawn) and what actions are available in each. This will help you plan your strategy effectively.

### Strategic Tips

- **Balance Your Actions**: Try to balance between building your pyramids, acquiring power tiles, and engaging in battles. Overcommitting to one aspect might leave you vulnerable in others.
  
- **Use Prayer Points Wisely**: Prayer points are a crucial resource. Plan your actions to ensure you have enough prayer points for key moves, especially when buying power tiles or raising pyramids.

- **Power Tiles**: Focus on acquiring power tiles that complement your strategy. Some tiles enhance combat, while others improve resource management or movement.

### Combat and Movement

- **Troop Management**: Keep your troops well-positioned to defend your city and control key areas. Remember, controlling temples and pyramids can earn you valuable victory points.

- **Battle Cards**: Use your battle cards strategically. Discarding a card face down during the war council step can bluff your opponent, while the card you play can turn the tide of battle.

### Victory Points and Endgame

- **Temporary vs. Permanent VP**: Understand the difference between temporary and permanent victory points. Temporary points can be lost if you lose control of an area, so plan to secure them.

- **Triggering Endgame**: Be aware of your victory point total and that of your opponents. The game ends when a player reaches 9 victory points, so time your actions to maximize your score before the endgame is triggered.

### Learning and Adaptation

- **Observe Opponents**: Pay attention to the strategies and actions of other players. This can help you anticipate their moves and adjust your strategy accordingly.

- **Experiment and Learn**: Don't be afraid to try different strategies and learn from each game. Kemet offers a rich variety of tactical options, and experimenting will help you discover what works best for you.

### Social Interaction

- **Communication**: Engage with other players and discuss strategies or alliances. Kemet is a social game, and interaction can add depth to the experience.

By keeping these additional rules and tips in mind, new players can enhance their understanding of Kemet and enjoy a more rewarding gaming experience. Remember, practice makes perfect, and each game is an opportunity to refine your skills and strategies. Enjoy the journey to becoming a master of Kemet!

## FAQ
A: Can Players teleport into a space containing another players units?
Q: No, you cannot teleport into a space that already contains units. Teleportation in Kemet requires that the destination space be empty, except for spaces with an Obelisk, which allows teleportation from a District with a Pyramid. However, if you teleport into a space with an opponent's Troop, it would immediately trigger a battle. Therefore, while you can teleport into a contested space, it will result in combat.

Q:
A: In Kemet, players recover their discarded Battle cards when they have used all of their Battle cards. Specifically:

1. At the end of each Battle, the Battle cards that were played are discarded face up.

2. The Battle card that was discarded face down during the War Council step remains face down and is not revealed.

3. If a player has discarded all of their Battle cards (meaning they have no more Battle cards in hand), they immediately take all of their Battle cards back into their hand.

This mechanic ensures that players always have Battle cards available for combat, but also requires them to cycle through their entire set of cards before getting them all back. It adds an element of strategy in managing which cards to use and when, as players need to consider not just the current battle but also future conflicts before they can recover their full set of cards.

Remember, the face-down discarded cards from the War Council step are never revealed and are only recovered along with the other cards when a player has used all their Battle cards.

3 GAME PLAY
A game of Kemet is played over a series of Rounds, and ends when the End of game has been triggered. Each Round consists of
one Day Phase (where Battle usually happen), then one Night Phase, and finally one Dawn Phase.
You will find a glossary of important concepts and terms on page 8.
3.1 Day Phase (player actions) :
â€¢ In turn order, each player becomes the active player and plays 1 of their 5 Action tokens.
â€¢ Movements and Recruitments may trigger Battle Phases.
3.2 Battle
â€¢ A Battle only involves the players whose Troops are on the same space.
â€¢ Resolve the Battle steps in order.
3.3 Night Phase (resolution) :
â€¢ The Night Phase is divided into steps which are resolved in order.
â€¢ Nocturnal Powers activate, VP and are awarded, and DI cards are allocated.
3.4 Dawn Phase (Determination) :
â€¢ If the End of game has been triggered, identify the winner.
â€¢ If the End of game has not been triggered, establish turn order for the next Day Phase.
Rules order of precedence:
When two rules contradict each other, the rule with the highest priority (highest number) takes precedence:
4) DI card > 3) Power tile > 2) expansion rules > 1) game rules.

3.1 â€“ DAY PHASE
Day Phase mechanics
In turn order, each player must place 1 Action token on a empty Action space of their individual board. Action token placement
is subject to the Equilibrium rule (described below), and a selected action effects are resolved immediately. This continues until
each player has placed (and resolved) their 5 Action tokens, at which point the Day Phase is over.
You may play a DI card with a DAY icon before or after any action taken by any player, and just before a Battle Phase.
The Equilibrium rule: At the end of the Day Phase, each player must have at least 1 Action token on each of the
3 levels of the pyramid on their individual board.
Playing silver and gold Action tokens: Play these Action tokens at the same time as an Action token of your color to
receive a bonus action. You may choose in which order you resolve your actions but each action must be completely
resolved before moving onto the next one.
Note: In the Kemet base game, the golden icon on top of the pyramid is only available to the player that owns the
God's Will Power tile.
Note: In the Kemet expansions, some Power tiles may give a gold Action token: you may buy several Power tiles
using a gold Action token, but you may only own 1 gold Action token, thus you may only trigger one Power using a
gold Action token per Round.
Triggering the End of game!
If a player has 9 VP (sum of their temporary and permanent VP) before playing one of their Action tokens, they
trigger the End of game, which occurs after the following Dawn Phase. This player places a Sanctuary VP from
the general supply under their Order token as a reminder.
Available actions on individual boards are detailed below.

4

3.1.1 PRAY ACTION
Gain 2 .

3.1.2 RAISE A PYRAMID ACTION
Raise the level of 1 of your Pyramids by any number of levels: spend as much as the value
of each level you wish to raise your Pyramid (raising a Pyramid multiple levels will sum up the
cost of each level). If you raise the level of the Pyramid in your supply, place it in your District
without a Pyramid.
Raising multiple levels with the same action is a unique cost.

Example : To raise a level 2
Pyramid to level 3, you need
to spend 3 .
Example : To raise a level 1
Pyramid to level 3, you need
to spend 5 .
(2 to raise to level 2, and 3
to raise to level 3)

Pyramid effects:
â€¢ Each Pyramid allows their controller to buy Power tiles that match its color and are of the same or lower level.
â€¢ Each level 4 Pyramid gives 1 Pyramid VP to the player that controls its District.
â€¢ Each Pyramid allows Units in its District to be teleported to any space that contains an Obelisk by spending 2 .
important!
If the Pyramid's District is controlled by an opponent, the original owner no longer gains these benefits, instead the
controlling opponent does.

3.1.3 Buy A POWER TILE ACTION
This action allows you to buy a Power tile of the same color as the space you placed your Action token. You may buy only 1 Power
tile of a specific color during the same Round.
Buy condition: To buy a Power tile, you must control a Pyramid of the same color which is at least the same level
as the Power tile you want to buy. You cannot buy a Power tile that has the same artwork as one you already own.
Power tile effects are immediately active. However, some of them will only trigger during a specific Phase, denoted
on each Power tile (eg. Battle Powers, Nocturnal Powers).
Cost: When you buy a Power tile, you have to spend as much as the level indicated on the Power tile. You own it
for the entire game, and it cannot be lost. Place it in front of you so everyone can see it.
(eg. To buy Shields of Neith, a level 3 Power tile, you have to control a level 3 or 4 sapphire Pyramid and spend 3 ).
Creatures : Immediately when you acquire a Creature tile or anytime a Creature is in your supply, you may place it in one of
your Districts where you have a Troop without a Creature. Otherwise the Creature is placed on its Power tile in your supply.
Before playing an Action token, you may exchange Creatures from your supply with Creatures that are in your Districts. When
a Creature has no more Troop with it, it goes back to your supply.
A Creature is not a Unit:
â€¢ It does not count against the Troop limit (5 Units max), but you may not have more than one Creature in each Troop,
â€¢ In Battle, only the Creature's bonuses are added to the tied Troop, it does not add +1 Force (as it is not a Unit inside
the Troop).

3.1.4 RECRUIT ACTION
Spend X to recruit X Units: take these Units from your supply and place them in one, two or three Districts of
your City.
You may only recruit into the Districts of your own City. Even if you control an opponent's District, you may not recruit in it.
If you recruit into one of your Districts controlled by an opponent, it immediately triggers a Battle in which you are
the attacker.
important!
In your City, your Troops have +1 Strength.

5

3.1.5 MOVEMENT ACTION
Move 1 of your Troops according to their Movement potential. Movement Potential is always
calculated at the beginning of a Movement action.
Movement potential for a Troop is a series of 1 Land move and 1 Teleportation.
Some Power tiles and DI cards may raise the number of Land moves, Teleportations per
Movement action.
During a Movement action you may:
- use each kind of move (Land move and Teleportation),
- move only a part of your Troop to leave some Units behind,
- add Units that are in spaces you pass through when moving your Troop.
important!
When moving, a Troop may temporarily exceed the Troop limit (5 Units) provided
the Troop limit is fulfilled at the end of the Movement action for each Troop on
the board.
Likewise, more than one Creature may temporarily be on the same space provided the
Creature limit (1 Creature per Troop) is fulfilled at the end of the Movement action.
Land move:
Spend 1 Land move to move your Troop to a directly adjacent space or one linked by an
arrow between 2 Harbors over the Nile.

3

A
2

1

B

Example:
Claire would like to move her
Troop from her City to the Nile
east bank.
She has 2 options:
A- She may teleport her Troop
by spending 2 and placing
her Troop on the Temple space.
B- She may use only land
moves if her Troop is able to
do 3 land moves (see diagram).
A way to do this is to have the
"Celerity" Power of the Desert
Snake Creature tied to this
Troop, which would save her 2
to move to the same space.

Teleportation:
Spend 2 to teleport your Troop from a District with a Pyramid (in your City or an opponent's one) to a space containing
an Obelisk.
Note: You do not spend a Land move when you teleport a Troop.
Walls:
Each District is surrounded by Walls. You may only enter an opponents' District if your Troop starts its Movement action
in a space adjacent to its Wall (which means you may only move into 1 opponent District during each Movement action).
Battle:
Whenever your Troop enters a space containing an opponent's Troop, your Movement action ends and a Battle is
immediately triggered.
Note: At the end of a move (and potentially the Battle that occurred) if you control a Temple or a level 4 Pyramid,
you take the corresponding temporary VP, wherever it is. To control a Temple or an opponent's Pyramid, you must
have a Troop in its space: if you ever move out of an opponents' space (leaving it empty) after controlling it, then any
temporary VP (temple or level 4 pyramid) gets returned to that player.

3.2 â€“ BATTLE
The attacker is the player whose move triggers the Battle, their opponent is the defender.
Resolve the following steps in order, even if a player has no Troop left at some point:
1) War council
At the start of a Battle, attacker and defender each choose 2 Battle cards from their hand:
- The first one is discarded face down on the table and will never be revealed,
- The second one will be played during the Battle, do not reveal it yet.
2) Preparation
Attacker and defender may add DAY or BATTLE DI cards to their Battle card by hiding them under it: this is the only
time you may play DI cards during the Battle. A player may tell their opponent they have played DI cards, but need not
be truthful. Players also do not need to admit to playing DI cards, even if asked. Other players may not play DI cards
during a Battle Phase.

6

3) Confrontation
When each player has finished selecting their cards, they simultaneously reveal them.
The DI card(s) effects are only taken into account if their owner spends the required.
Beginning with the attacker, each player announces whether they spend and in which
order they resolve their DI cards.
4) Resolution
The player who has the most Strength is the Champion. In case of a tie, the defender is
the Champion.
The Strength of each player in the Battle is the sum of:
â€¢ The number of Units they have in the Battle,
â€¢ The Strength value of their played Battle card,
â€¢ The potential Strength bonus given by their Power tiles,
â€¢ The potential Strength bonus given by the Creature tied to their Troop in the Battle,
â€¢ The potential Strength bonus given by the DI cards they played,
â€¢ +1 Strength if the Battle occurs in a Quarter from the City of the player.
5) Casualties
Each Battle card shows a Damage value and/or a Defense value. These values can be modified
thanks to DI cards, Powers and Creatures in this Battle.
Each player in the Battle loses as many Units from their Troop as the total Damage value their
opponent has, minus their own Defense value.
If the Champion has lost their Troop, they are still considered to be the Champion, even if
the loser still has a Troop in the space where the Battle occurred.
6) Reward
If the attacker is the Champion and they still have a Troop on the space where the Battle
occurred, they gain 1 Battle VP.
7) Loser's aftermath
The loser has to choose between retreating and recalling their Troop.
If the Champion has no more Troop on the space where the Battle occurred, the loser
may also choose to stay on this space instead.
8) Champion's aftermath
The Champion chooses if they recall their Troop of if they stay on the space where the
Battle occurred.
Retreating
If the loser retreats, the Champion chooses an adjacent empty space where they move the
vanquished Troop. This is not a Movement action. They may not choose a District from a
City that is not the loser's. If no space is available, the loser may not retreat and has to recall
their Troop.
Recalling a Troop
After battle either player may recall their Troop, removing their entire Troop to gain X-1 ,
where X is the number of Units removed this way.
9) Battle ending
Each player discards the Battle card they played and resolved face up. The one they
discarded during the War council step stays face down and should never be revealed.
If a player has discarded all their Battle cards, they immediately take them back all to
their hand.
The played DI (used or not) cards are discarded face up near the DI deck.
Resume the Phase where it was interrupted.
Note: Any effect that adds Units in a District controlled by an opponent triggers a Battle
in Night Phase (eg. Reinforcements Power tile). Resolve these Battles like the ones triggered
during a Recruit action.

Example : Jacques moves
his Troop to a Temple
controlled by Guillaume's
Troop.
â€¢ Jacques is the attacker.
Troop: 5 Units.
Powers:
â€¢ Charge! (+1 Strength when
attacking)
â€¢ Blades of Neith (+1
Strength in Battles).
He has 7 Force (5+1+1).
â€¢ Guillaume is the defender.
Troop: 4 Units.
Creature: Ancestral Elephant
(+1 Strength to its tied
Troop).
He has 5 Force (4+1).
Both players choose secretly
2 Battle cards: the first one is
discarded face down and the
other is kept in hand and will
be played.
â€¢ Jacques plays his Battle
card: 3 Strength, and 2
Damage.
He does not play any DI card.

trigger during the same step, they choose the order of resolution.

3.4 â€“ DAWN PHASE
1) End of game
If the End of game was triggered during the previous Day Phase (see end of page 4), each player sums up the temporary VP and
permanent VP in their possession: the one who has the most VP wins the game (the reminder VP under the Order token is not
added).
In case of a tie, if the player who triggered the End of the game is tied, they win the game. Otherwise, the tied player thats owns
the most Battle VP wins the game. If there is still a tie, the tied player who is leftmost on the Turn order track wins the game.
2) Turn order
Starting with the player that has the least VP, then in growing VP order, each player chooses their position on the
Order track by placing their Order token on an empty space. In case of a tie, the tied player who was leftmost on the
Order track during the previous round chooses first and so on.
Note: In order to keep the view of the previous turn order, lower the Order tokens under their current spaces. This
will help you manage ties.
