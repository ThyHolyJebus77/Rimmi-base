   - Explore: Read only the part of the card that applies to your choice.

6. Draw and Gain Cards:
   - Draw cards until you have 3 in your hand.

7. Key Rules to Remember:
   - You can't gain the Attribute Trophy as your final trophy to win the game.
   - Keep track of how many turns you take for final scoring.
   - When you defeat a monster, don't draw a new one to replace it.

8. Game End:
   - The game ends when you've defeated all 3 monsters and gained the Attribute Trophy.
   - Compare your turn count to the table in the rulebook to see how well you did.

Remember, solo play is a great way to learn the game mechanics. Take your time, and don't hesitate to refer to the full rulebook if you need clarification on any points. Enjoy your adventure in the world of The Witcher!

Setup for a 2-Player Game




9 Starting Player and Help Cards

The Player who most recently read a Witcher book is the Starting Player; alternatively, you can determine this randomly.
Each Player takes an Action and Fight Help Card.

10 Player Components Each Player does the following:
1.     Starting with the Player to the right of the starting Player, then continuing in counter-clockwise order, each Player takes a Player Board, by performing the following steps (one at a time):

ƒShuffle all (unchosen) Player Boards face-down.

ƒDraw 2; then, choose 1 to keep. (Return the uncho-sen one back with the remaining Boards.)

ƒThe next Player repeats the two previous steps until all Players have chosen a Player Board.

Clarification: The Starting Player of the game should be making the last choice (in a 5-Player game the Starting Player draws the last remain-ing Player Board).

Optionally: Players can distribute Player Boards using any method they choose.

2. Take the Scoring Token (matching your School color) and place it on the lowest spot of the Trophy Track.

3. Take the Witcher Miniature that corresponds to your chosen Player Board; take and attach the matching colored ring to it, then place the miniature on the School Location that matches your chosen School symbol.

5. Take the number of your Witcher Trophy Cards equal to the number of your opponents (i.e. 3 cards in a 4-Player game); place them face down under your Player Board.

6. Take the Shield Marker (matching your School color) and place it on the “1” spot of the Shield Track.

7. Take your 10 starting cards (they can be identified by the icon in the top right corner that matches your chosen School); shuffle them in a face-down deck and place it on the corresponding spot next to your Player Board.

8. According to the number of Players and Player order:

ƒTake the indicated amount of Gold; place it nearby your Player Board.
Firstly, we recommend playing a 1-3 Player game first, before playing a 4 or 5 Player game. Once each Player is familiar with the game, the game will proceed much more smoothly.
When playing the game with 4 or 5 Players, after you setup the game as normal, perform the 2 additional steps below:

1.	Prepare an additional stack of Level I Monster tokens.
Place the stack face down near the Monster section on the Game Board.
For a 4-Player game:

ƒRandomly draw 1 Level I Monster token for the stack.
For a 5-Player game:



ƒDraw the indicated number of cards from your deck.
ƒRandomly draw 2 Level I Monster tokens for the stack.

ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageTHE GOAL OF THE GAME


In The Witcher: Old World, each Player takes control of a Witcher, trained in one of the five schools. Players set out to explore the vast Continent, training and fighting to gain glory along the way. Players take Turns in clock-wise order. Players strive to acquire 4 Trophies during the game. The first Player to do so wins immediately, bringing the highest honor and renown to their Witcher School!
Trophies are gained in multiple ways: Defeating Mon-sters (the primary way), winning fights against other Witchers, and by reaching level 5 of an Attribute.


How to use this Rulebook?

The best way to learn how to play The Witcher: Old World, is to go through the next four chap-ters of this Rulebook, in this order:

ƒGame Basics (page 9),

ƒPlayer’s Turn Explained (page 12),

ƒFights (page 20),

ƒLocation Actions (page 35).
We also recommend that you use this order when teaching the game – just focus on the main rules to help new Players grasp the game flow.




Golden Rule
Card text supersedes the Rulebook:

ƒIf any text on a card contradicts any rule written in this rulebook, obey the rules on the card.

ƒIf Players disagree on how an effect should be resolved: resolve it in a way that would maintain the greatest thematic sense.




GAME BASICS


Action Cards

Each Player begins with a unique Deck of 10 Action Cards; additionally, each Player can gain new cards – and even permanently lose some cards – to craft their own customized deck during the game!
Action Cards have multiple uses; you can play each card for one of the following effects, either:

1.	to Move, or

2. use a Fight ability.


The bottom-left corner of the card depicts a Terrain sym-bol. (See Movement, on page 12).
ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageThe bottom-right corner depicts the name and the cost of the card (see Drawing and Gaining Cards, on page 18).
The top-left part of the card depicts the ability that may be used during an Attack (see Witcher’s Fight Turn, on page 22).
There are 5 Types of cards: Fast Attack (blue), Strong Attack (red), Dodge (green), Defensive Sign (yellow), and Offensive Sign (purple).
Attributes and Witcher’s Level

You have 4 Attributes depicted on your Player Board.
The 3 leftmost ones are common among all Player Boards:


Combat will help you draw more cards during a Fight.


Defense will help you block more Damage during a Fight.



Fight Ability







Card Type/Color

Starting Deck




Extension
Any time you raise your Defense level, im-mediately raise your Shield level by 1 on your Shield track.

Alchemy will help you consume more magical Potions during a Fight.
Any time you raise your Alchemy level, im-mediately gain 1 Potion taken from the top of the Potion Deck.


The rightmost Attribute - Specialty - is unique; it is de-termined by the Witcher school you chose during setup:



Terrain Symbol	aard

Name and cost




Rules for each Player’s deck:

ƒAlways keep it face down on the left side of your Player Board.

ƒYou can always look at all the cards in your deck when you suffer Fatigue (page 29). You may have to look at all the cards in your deck as a result of some Exploration Cards. Besides that, you can look through your deck, when you are not the Active Player and you are not in a Fight. When you are done looking through your deck, you must shuffle it and place it face-down.

Specialty is different for each Witcher, and all of them are explained later in this Rulebook (see page 34).


Leveling Up
After all of your Attribute markers are raised above your current Witcher Level, you immediately Level-Up to the next Level.

ƒWhen you Level-Up to Level II or III: Immediately


Rules for each Players’ discard pile:

ƒAlways keep it face up, to the left of

ƒIf any effect forces you to discard a face up on your discard pile.


Rules for Trashing a card:

ƒIf any effect forces you to Trash a ca the game box; it cannot be used an this game.




1. The Player raises their Alchemy level, so they move their Alchemy Attribute marker to the Level 2 spot.



10
ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImagee-

When you turn up on the following day to col-lect the potion, the man is nowhere to be found. You return to the inn and find out where he might be hiding.
Discard all Potions.

2. Each of Player’s Attributes are on the Level 2 or	Enter:	34. higher, so the Player raises their Witcher’s Level to II.





!
Note: Sometimes, during a Fight or Exploration, you lower your Attribute. You never lower your Witcher’s Level, even if all your Attributes are lowered below your current Level.

If one of your Attributes reach Level 5, it also may never be lowered.

ƒAs Trail Tokens for a specific Monster – kept face-down on the Player Board, i.e. face-down Forest Token is considered as a Monster Trail Token for the Monster that is occupying a Forest Location at that moment.




Location Tokens
Location Tokens serve several purposes in the game. To avoid any confusion, we have explained them here, before we get into the rules description. LocationTokens are kept face-down near the Board.
They are used in several ways:

ƒTo show where the Monsters are located – placed face-up on the designated slots on the Game.



Location Tokens Clarifications

ƒIf there is no Location Token of a specific Terrain Type, the Player can not get a Trail Quest or a Trail Token for the Monster oc-cupying Location of that Type.

ƒIf there is no Location token of the Terrain Type indicated on the Exploration Card, the Player draws a Location Token of any other TerrainType. If there are no other Location Tokens in the pool, they can not resolve the Quest and the Exploration card is dis-carded.
Manticore School Special Location
There is a special Location on the Map that doesn’t have any corresponding Location To-ken. This Location number is 0 and it may be found in the east. Although there will be no Monsters, Trails or Quests connected to this Lo-cation, it still has a Location Action that Players can use (see Location Actions on page 35). The Witcher from the School of the Manticore is part of Monster Trail Expansion and is described with details in the rulebook to this expansion.
















Potions
Keep your unused Potions face up near your Player Board.
You may have up to 4 Potions at a time, regardless of your Alchemy level.
If you exceed the limit, discard any chosen Potion(s) down to 4.

PLAYER’S TURN EXPLAINED


ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageEach Player’s Turn is divided into 3 Phases:

I.	Movement and Actions

II. Fight, Meditate, or Explore

III. Draw and Gain Cards

The Game Board depicts Phases I, II and III to aid Players.










Once all Players are familiar with the game, Player Turns (Phases) may overlap with the next Player (when Player decisions are not impacted by what other Players do). Phase III of a Player’s Turn consists mostly of some deck management. When the Active Player is doing that, the next Player can begin Phase I of their Turn.

HASE I: Movement and Actions


The Witcher travels across the vast Continent; it may be a long trip, where you visit huge cities to prepare for your next hunt.
In Phase I, the Active Player uses car visit different Locations to perform Act

The Active Player may also decide to entirely, and proceed to Phase II.

1. Movement

ƒYou can discard any 2 cards (depic icons), to move to a Connected L picts any Terrain.

ƒYou can discard any 1 card (depic icon) and 1 Gold, to move to a Con that depicts any Terrain.





[…] Otto leaned towards me over the table, his eyes a little unfocused now from the local moonshine. I must mention that nowhere in the world is dwar-ven drink as fine as in the mountains of Mahakam. It warms the bones as fiercely as a phoenix rising, even in the midst of winter. Otto tells me with pride, that dwarves fear no one. He goes on to explain that years ago his people created complex systems that allow them to flood mines and withdraw during war-time. I told him it’s fortunate they need not test those systems yet and ask him to pour, for my mustache was turning into icicles. But the thought of how dif-ferent the mountainous land of the dwarves truly is and how unique the temperament of its people stayed with me for a long time. In the following years I learned that no two lands are the same, just like you’ll not find two identical snowflakes. And every land is worth discovering for yourself!
Chronicles of Benno Kobart, excerpt from chapter III, A Description of the World.
ƒ If a card has a Wild icon: you ca discard just this 1 card to move t a Connected Location that depict any Terrain.

Movement Clarifications

ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageƒSince step 2 of Phase I is optional, you may Move any number of times before proceed-ing to step 2 – discarding a card(s) for each Movement.

ƒBefore you go to step 2, you must Move
Location Action Clarifications

ƒYou may perform a LocationAction even if other Witchers or Monsters are there.

ƒIt is possible to take a Location Action at your starting Location; to do so, you must move away from, and then back to that Location during your Turn.














Dice Poker Clarifications

ƒYou don’t need to play Dice Poker at all, and you can pick and choose who you play with.

ƒIt is possible to play Dice Poker at your starting Location; to do so, you must move away and back, during step 1, using cards for each movement as normal.

ƒIf you choose to perform the Location Ac-tion, you may also play Dice Poker with another Witcher at this Location, either before or after.

ƒIf you play Dice Poker with a Witcher, you can’t decide to fight with that Witcher during Phase II of the current Turn.

ƒDice Poker is explained below and on your Help Card.

3. Both Players each take a set of 5 dice and roll them simultaneously.

Do NOT perform step 2 if this would end the game, giving you your “Final Trophy” to win the game with.

3. Proceed to Phase III.



a) Witcher Fight

ƒYou may choose a Witcher at your Location to Fight; if you do, they cannot refuse to participate.

ƒYou cannot Fight a Witcher that you played Dice Poker with this Turn.

ƒYou cannot Fight with another Witcher on a School Location and on a Location with a Closed Tavern Token.





!


Note: The game can only end from a Trophy that is obtained from a Fight. Because of this, if you Meditate, and this would result in you gaining your Final Trophy (i.e., gaining this Trophy will end the game): do not move on the Trophy track and do not suffer Fatigue. You still take the Trophy for its ability, but the game does not end.

“Witcher Fight” is explained on page 20.


b) Monster Fight

ƒYou may choose to Fight a Monster in your Lo-cation (marked by a Monster Token).

“Monster Fight” is explained on page 21.

Note: After reaching Level 5 in an At-tribute, it may no longer be lowered for any reason.



[…] and among warriors, witchers are the finest. They fight using not only swords, but magic too. Those mutants, while far less adept at the arts of magic than wizards, can still do things undreamed of by most men. And when they face monsters, they seem to go into a battle rage and become like monsters themselves.

Exploration Cards
Exploration Cards are divided into 3 sections:

1. The Introduction with 2 Options.



When you Explore, you must choose one of the following to explore, either:

a. The City, which you are currently in; explore the streets and buildings, and talk to people.


!

Note: The Option may require the Play-er to pay a certain amount of Gold. If that Player is unable to do so,they can-not choose this Option.



b. The Wilds, which surround the City you are cur-rently in; explore the trails, villages and take in the fauna of the wilderness.


2. Option A Result (containing the story and cost and/or result of making that choice).



After choosing one, the following steps must be per-formed in order:
3. Option B Result (containing the story and cost and/or result of making that choice).



Note: Exploring has no requirements, so this option is always available for you to choose.


1. The Player to the right of the Active Player draws a card from the corresponding deck - either the City or Wilds deck, depending on your choice.



Introduction with 2 Options

You are stopped by guardsmen in the middle of the street.
‘You were seen using sorcery. Don’t you know that you need a license from the Chapter for that?’
Not long after, you find yourself in a dungeon, where you spend several hours in a filthy cell. When a guard brings your meal, you feel confident there’s no one else around but the two of you.
Attack the guard and fight your way out.
Ask for a cup of water. You never know what might happen before the guard brings it.



2. They read the Introduction and Options on that card to the Active Player.
Do not read or discuss the results at this point!

3. The Active Player chooses one of the options on the card; then, they are read the Result of that choice.
Do not read or discuss the results of the other choice!

Option A Result



Option B Result

Before he drops face-first into a bowl of groats, the guard seems momentarily surprised. You find your swords, but can’t seem to find your purse anywhere.
Lose 2 Gold and raise your Combat level by 1.
Before long, an official of high station enters the prison. He regards you with contempt and in-forms you that to him, a witcher and a sorceress are the same kind of devilry. But he admits that the charges were false and pays you a compen-sation fee.
Gain 2 Gold.




Exploration Cards Clarifications

ƒAll the effects on the Exploration Cards, whether positive or negative, relate to the Active Player.

ƒSome Exploration Cards allow the Active Player to draw any 1 of the revealed Action Cards of some cost to their discard pile. If there is no card of that specific cost in the pool, the Player reveals cards 1 at a time, from the top of the Action Deck and adds the first card of that specific cost to their discard pile. All other newly revealed cards are then discarded.

ƒSome Exploration Cards ask the Active Player to gain any 1 Trail. In that case, they choose 1 type of Terrain and draw 1 Token from the chosen Terrain Token pile. They keep that Token as a Trail Token.

ƒIf the Quest has a Terrain Type connected with it, you draw a random Terrain Token of that Type and place it face-up on the Quest. The Location rep-resented by the token is now the Quest Location.

ƒThere is no penalty to ignore a Quest. Unresolved Quests are simply discarded at the end of the game with no effect.

ƒYou can acquire any number of Quests; you do not need resolve one before getting another.

ƒIf you need to take a specific type of a Terrain To-ken, and the pool is empty, take any other random Terrain Token to define the Quest Location.

These cards are kept by the Active Player near their Player Board for the entirety of the Game (unless the card states otherwise).

After resolving a Quest with a Location Token, shuffle the token back into the appropriate stack and remove the Exploration Card from the game.

The last Phase of your Turn represents rest and training. After traveling – encountering new places, people, and dangers – it’s time to calm your mind and prepare for the road ahead; however, a Witcher still needs to practice their new fighting and magical skills too.
In this Phase, Player completes following 3 steps in order:















crossbow Once per Fight:
1.     You may choose and discard any number of cards from your hand (you may have a maximum of 3 cards at the end of this step).

2. Draw Cards from your Action Deck until you have 3 Cards in your hand.

ƒWhen you need to draw an Action Card but your Action Deck is empty, immediately shuffle all discarded Action Cards to create a new Action Deck, then continue drawing as normal.

3. Choose 1 of the 6 Action Cards revealed on the Board which will be added to your deck and pay its cost.










!
Note: When you lower your Defense as a result of an Exploration or Event Card, remember to lower your Shield level if necessary.

Hand-Limit
ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageYour Hand-Limit is 7 cards: if you have 7 cards in your hand, and you are supposed to draw any number of additional cards, stop drawing additional cards; the effect is lost.



Depending on the card’s position (in the row of cards on the Board), its cost may be modified:
Clarifications

ƒGaining a new card is not optional; you must take 1, even if you don’t want it.

ƒWhen you pay for a new card, you discard cards from your hand to your discard pile.

ƒCards with a higher cost will typically be stronger.


ƒIf the card is on the right-most slot, you may take it discarding 1 less card than its normal cost. The cost may be reduced to 0, but not below (any additional reduction is ignored).

ƒIf the card is on one of the two left-most slots, you must discard 1 additional card to take it.
















When you take a new card in this step, it goes directly into your hand (not your discard pile); after, slide cards to the right (to fill the empty space); then, draw 1 new card and place it on the left-most (empty) slot.

Note: Gaining a new card after losing a Fight is explained on page 27.


fights



ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageWitchers are trained to hunt Monsters, but their ex-ceptional skills are of use when they must defend their schools’ honor in a bar fight.
When at the same Location as another Witcher or Mon-ster, as the Active Player, you can choose to Fight in Phase II of your Turn. You cannot Fight with another Witcher on a School Location.
Fights with a Monster or a Witcher have some simi-lar rules, which are described first – these are General Fight Rules. Unique rules for either type of Fight are described next.



They say each one of them carries two swords – silver for monsters and steel for people. I’ve met witchers who drew the latter with reluctance, and I’ve met witchers who rarely left it in its scabbard.
Chronicles of Benno Kobart, excerpt from chapter XVI, What is a Witcher?
to that situation is not considered to be Knocked-Out and is the winner.
When you are Knocked-Out by the Monster, you may still get a reward for Driving the Monster Away (explained on page 26).


[…] To see one of them fighting a monster is a feast for the eyes, but to see two witchers dueling is a spectacle! The one I found most spectacular hap-pened in Vengerberg. One of the witchers was a Wolf, the other must have been a Cat, based on his feline grace and speed. They were at each other’s throats from the moment when news came out about a con-tract, then they fought at a tavern... what a sight that was! None who saw it will ever forget it. Only the tavern keeper seemed sad after they split a long table in two.
Chronicles of Benno Kobart, excerpt from chapter XVI, What is a Witcher?



WITCHER FIGHT RULES


ƒBoth Witchers prepare to fight as described in the General Fight Rules.

GENERAL FIGHT RULES


These apply to both Witcher and Monster Fights.
If you are the Active Player (the Attacking Witcher) or the Defending Witcher, you both:
Keep the cards that are in your hand (do not discard any of them); you do not draw additional cards at the begin-ning of a Fight, unless another rule explicitly says so.
To create your Life Pool Deck, do the following:
Combine and shuffle all of your discarded Action Cards with your entire Action Deck; place it nearby as a face-down deck – this is your Life Pool Deck.

ƒBoth Witchers in the Fight take one Turn at a time, alternating back and forth, with the Attacking Play-er taking the first Turn.

ƒThe Fight ends immediately when a Witcher is Knocked-Out (as detailed above in the general rules).

ƒAfter a Witcher Fight, place the Closed Tavern Token on the Location. A Player cannot attack an-other Player on a Location with that Token. The Closed Tavern Token remains in this Location and is moved only when another Witcher Fight took place elsewhere.


Life Pool Deck and Getting Knocked-Out

The cards in this deck represent your remaining Life. Once your Life Pool Deck runs out and you discard/ play your last in-hand card, you are Knocked-Out; the opponent immediately wins the Fight!
When both opponents lose their last card on the same Fight Turn, the Player who played the card(s) which led

Make a Wager

ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageAdditionally, before a Witcher Fight only, spectators may make a Wager.
Each other Player (those not Fighting), may place one Wager.
To place a Wager, take 1 Gold (from your supply) and place it on one of the upper-right spots on your Player Board.

e it on this spot, you wager tacking Witcher (the Active
going to win the Fight.

If you place it on this spot, you wager that the Defending Witcher (non-Active Player) is going to win the fight.
MONSTER FIGHT RULES



ƒThe Player to the right of the Active Player becomes the Player controlling the Monster.
ƒBefore the Fight, the Player controlling the Monster reads out loud the Monster’s Special Ability de-scription - the description states when the Special Ability must be used.





Wager Clarifications

ƒYour miniature does not need to be on the Location (where the Fight is taking place) to place a Wager.

ƒPlacing a Wager is always optional.

ƒDuring a 2-Player game, no Player can make a Wager.

Monster’s Level


Monster’s Life Points

Monster’s Special Ability




During the Monster’s first Fight Turn:
pick the Attack Type that makes the Player discard more cards from their deck or hand.



ƒPlayers place Wagers against the “bank”, not one of the other Witchers.

ƒPlayers can’t Wager more than 1 Gold.

ƒ Before the Fight, the Player controlling the Mon-ster creates Monster’s Life Pool. That Player draws a number of Monster Fight cards from the top of the Monster Fight Deck, equal to the Monster’s Life Points as depicted on the Monster Card. They shuffle the drawn cards together to form the Mon-ster’s Life Pool.


ƒIf the Monster takes any Damage, Player controlling the Monster discards a number of Cards from the Monster Life Pool equal to Damage suffered.

ƒWhen the Monster takes it’s Turn, Player controlling the Monster will draw a single card from the top of the Monster Life Pool (see page 25 for more details).

ƒAny Player may always count the number of cards in the Monster Life Pool, without looking at them or changing their order.

ƒIf the Active Player has a Monster Trail Token for that Monster, they take the first Turn during this Fight; otherwise, the Monster takes the first Turn.

ƒThe Witcher and the Monster will take Fight Turns alternately, until the Witcher is Knocked-Out, or the Monster is Defeated.
WITCHER’S FIGHT TURN


ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImage’ImageImage’…ImageImageEach Turn represents just a few seconds during the Fight. The Witcher can drink Potions, utilize Specialties they’ve learned, and most importantly, attack their op-ponent. Creating Card Combos represents a Witcher’s fighting finesse by combining the right dodges, magi-cal signs, and sword mastery. The Witcher constantly moves to avoid attacks, and tries to use the momentum of the attacks to their fullest.
The Witcher Fight Turn is divided into 4 Steps, resolved in the following order:

1. Using Potions, Specialties, and Effects
Potions:
You may use one or more Potions, up to your limit. The limit of Potions that you can use in total during the entire Fight is shown by your Alchemy Attribute Level.

Potions Limit:You may have up to 4 Potions at a time, regardless of your Alchemy level.


Potions, Specialties and Effects Clarifications
ƒYou can use any effect during this step, unless it explicitly states that it must be used at another time.

ƒAs long as card or Specialty description doesn’t say otherwise, you can use these any number of times and in any order.

ƒUsing any of these is always optional.

ƒAll of these effects count toward your At-tack and may trigger some other effects, applied as a result of your Attack.



2. Playing a card Combo

From your hand, play 1 or more cards connected together to form a Combo.
To form a Combo, do the following:


1.	Place any card face up in front of you.

2. Place another card connected (on top):

ƒThe color of the card must match 1 of the Combo Extension Color(s) on the card you place it on.







To keep track of how many Potions you have used this Fight, flip them face down after using and keep them nearby; discard them after the Fight is over.

Witcher Speci You may use you scription found o of this rulebook.
Card Effects: You may use card Effect.

Note: The color only needs to match one Combo Extension color of the card directly beneath (this is only relevant when making a Combo comprised of 3 or more cards).
3. Resolving a card Combo

a) Dealing Damage
Sum all used Damage Icons on all cards in your Combo; your opponent Suffers Damage equal to this sum.




All the effects on the card played and on the Combo Extensions that Player used are resolved in the follow-ing steps.
The effects are resolved only after the Player is done playing their Card Combo.

Card Details:
Each card has a color, and most have Combo Extensions allowing them to create Combos with other cards.
The Player deals 3 Damage to their opponent.
There is no card connected to the Block card Extension, so the Yellow Extension Effect does not apply.



When fighting a Monster:



ƒ Card Combo Clarifications
For each point of Damage dealt to the Monster, discard 1 card from the top of Monster’s Life Pool.



ƒ1 card is still considered a Combo, even though it is only a 1-Card Combo.

ƒIf you have any cards in your hand, you must play a combo of at least 1 card; how-ever, you are not required to play all of your cards, even if you are able to play a larger Combo.

ƒThe connected card (on top) must match only 1 Combo Extension. Remaining Exten-sions and their effects are ignored.

When fighting a Witcher, Damage is always applied in this order: Shield, deck, then hand, as follows:

ƒ For each Damage taken, the Player lowers their Shield level;

ƒ If their Shield level is 0, and there is still excess Damage to suffer, they discard 1 card from the top of their deck for each excess Damage;

ƒ If their deck is empty, and there is still excess Damage to suffer, they discard 1 chosen card from their hand for each excess Damage;

b) Raising Shield level
ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImage’“”After all Damage is taken, you sum all Shield icons that are visible on your Combo, and raise your Shield level by that amount.
ƒAdd or subtract any modifiers coming from Combo played during this turn.

ƒ Modify the result again for any special cards or effects.




!


Note: Your Shield level may never go above your Defense Attribute value.
The final result is the number of cards you draw.
If your Combat Attribute value result is 0 (or less), you draw 0 cards (any value below 0 is ignored, and has no additional effect).
If your deck is depleted, do not shuffle your discard pile and stop drawing cards.
After drawing cards, place all cards from your Card Com-bo into your discard pile (with card starting the Combo being on the bottom).
Your Hand-Limit is 7 cards: if you have 7 cards in your hand, and you are supposed to draw any number of additional cards, stop drawing additional cards; the ef-fect is lost.


There are 3 Shield Icons in Player’s Combo. Their current Shield level is 1, so they raise it by 2, to the level 3. The Player cannot raise their Shield level to 4, since their Defense level is 3.

c) Performing Special Effects
After raising your Shield level, perform the special Effects in your Combo (if there are any):

Draw the top card from the discard pile.
The Player takes the top card from their discard pile and adds it to their hand. The cards used for this Turn’s Combo are not part of the discard pile yet.

Return this card to your hand.
The Player takes this card and adds it back into their hand. Other Cards used in the combo (if any) are sent to the discard pile.

Draw more or less cards
Cards with this Effect are resolved during Step 4 of the Fight Turn.

Combo Extensions effects: Some of the Combo Ex-tensions have special effects. Resolve them only if the Combo Extension is used to extend this Combo.


4. Replenishing Your Hand

At the end of each Fight Turn, Player replenishes their hand as per below steps:

ƒ Basic number of cards is equal to Combat Attri-bute value.


The Player’s Combat level is 2 and there is a +2 modifier in their Combo. They have used a Potion that tells them to draw 1 less card.
2+2-1=3, so the Player draws 3 cards.

MONSTER’S FIGHT TURN

END OF THE FIGHT AND THE OUTCOME
ƒDiscarding random cards from their hand

The Active Player shuffles their hand of cards and the Player controlling the Monster randomly choos-es 1/2/3 cards (based on the Monster Level). Those cards go to the discard pile.
If the Player doesn’t have the required number of cards in their hand, the whole hand is discarded, and any remaining cards are discarded from the top of their deck.

The Fight ends when the Life Pool of one Witcher or Monster is reduced to 0, then the opposing side (that still has Life remaining) is declared the victor and wins the Fight.
This can occur through taking Damage, or by having an opponent play their last card(s) and after resolv-ing it/them, the opposing player still has 1 or more cards left.




The Player discards a number of random cards from their hand (empty hand: from the top of their deck) according to the Monster’s level:

The Monster Fight may result in one of three Outcomes:

1.	Player Defeats the Monster, as explained above.

2. Player Drives the Monster Away.
4/5-Player Gameplay Changes
The Additional Monster Token Stack:



This happens when the Player is Knocked-Out, but the Monster has 0 or 1 card left in their Life Pool.

3. Player is Defeated.
It happens when the Player is Knocked-Out, and the Monster has 2 or more cards left in their Life Pool.
If there is a Level I Monster token available in this stack, when a Level I Monster is Defeated during normal gameplay (not Driven Away), place the top token from this stack into the game (instead of placing a Level II Monster as you would normally).




Defeating the Monster

1.     When you Defeat a Monster, take the Monster Card and gain 2 Gold.

2. Turn the card over and read the fight description. You may read it out loud.

3. Move up by 1 on the TrophyTrack and suffer Fatigue (detailed on page 29).

4. Slide the Monster Card under your Player Board, so the Trophy ability is visible.
When the additional stack is empty, continue playing the game and placing new Monsters as normal.




Driving the Monster Away

If you are Knocked-Out during a Fight, but you manage to reduce the Monster’s Life Pool to to 1 or 0, you Drive the Monster Away; when this occurs, perform the fol-lowing steps:




After a Monster is Defeated, you must Spawn a Monster, by performing the following steps.
1.	Gain 2 Gold.

2. Discard the Monster Card and the Monster Token.



1.	Draw a random Monster Token which is 1 level higher than the just Defeated Monster. Example: If a Level II Monster was Defeated, you draw a ran-dom Level III Monster token.
3. Add a 0-cost Action Card to your discard pile (explained below).
Follow Spawn a Monster steps as explained above, with one change.



ƒIf Level III Monster is Defeated: draw another Level III Monster instead.

ƒIf you run out of Monster Tokens of a certain level, make a new pile from all the Driven-Away Monsters of that level.

2. The Monster Token, Location Token connected to the Defeated Monster, corresponding Trail Tokens, and corresponding Trail Quests from all Players are discarded face-down back to their respective pools and shuffled. Location Tokens on Quest cards are not discarded.

3. Draw a Location Token of the same Terrain type as the Defeated Monster’s one and place it on the emp-ty Monster section of the Game Board.

4. Place the Monster Token (that was drawn during step 1) near the Location on the Game Board, that corresponds to the Location Token drawn in step 3.
Draw the new Monster of the same level as the Mon-ster you have Driven Away. If you run out of Monster Tokens of a certain level, make a new pile of Driven Away Monsters of that level.

Complete Defeat

If you are Knocked-Out during a Fight, and you failed to reduce the Monster’s Life Pool to 1 or 0, you suffer a Complete Defeat; when this occurs, perform the following steps:

1. Take 1 Trail Token matching the Monster’s Terrain (if the Player doesn’t already have one).

2. Add a 0-cost Action Card to your discard pile.

3. Modification: During this Turn only, you can only draw up to 2 cards during Phase III of your Turn (see page 18).

1.     Shuffle all the Monster Fight Cards together to form a new deck.

2. Shuffle the Action Cards in your deck, discard pile, and hand together to form a new deck. Then, proceed to Phase III of your Turn (see page 18).

3. Raise your Shield level up to your Defense level.



Add a 0-cost Action Card to your discard pile
When you Drive the Monster Away or the Monster or other Player Defeats you, you are required to add a 0-cost Action Card to your discard pile; in all cases, perform the following steps exactly, unless explicitly stated to do otherwise:
2. The Defending (non-Active) Player won:

ƒThe Defending (non-Active) Player gains Gold, shuffles their deck and draw 4 cards.

ƒThe Attacking (Active) Player adds a 0-cost Ac-tion Card to their discard pile and draws one card less, during Phase III.


Rulers and city councils throughout the Continent are giving out privileges and monopolies like it’s a contest, and levy import taxes to regulate mar-kets in accordance with their own interests. And the merchants, unsurprisingly, are racing to find ways how to bend the rules and get ahead. To think they could simply go out and have an honest fistfight, like the witchers do… I guess some people simply love bureaucracy.
Chronicles of Benno Kobart, excerpt from chapter VII, Politics and Cliques.



1.	Take any 1 of the Action Cards from the re-vealed pool that has a printed cost of 0. Ignore the printed cost modifier on the Game Board.

2. Place it on your discard pile.

3. Replenish the Action Card pool as normal, described on page 19.
Gaining a Trophy

If the Active Player (who initiated the Fight) won, they perform the following steps:
If you already have a Trophy from that Witcher (i.e. you initiated the Fight with them before and won), skip all steps below.



If there are no 0-cost cards in theAction Card Dis-play: ignore steps 1, 2, and 3; then instead, perform the following steps:

1.	Reveal cards (one at a time) from the top of the common Action Deck, until a 0-cost card is revealed;

1. Take 1 Witcher Trophy that belongs to the Defeated Witcher. Those Trophies are kept underneath the upper part of the Player Board.

2. Turn the card over and read the fight description. You may read it out loud.



2. Place that card into your discard pile, then

3. Place the remaining cards that were revealed (if any) into a common discard pile, next to the Game Board.
3. Move up by 1 on the TrophyTrack and suffer Fatigue (detailed on page 29).

4. Slide the Witcher Trophy under your Player Board, so the Trophy ability is visible.





WITCHER FIGHT OUTCOMES


The Witcher Fight may result in one of two Outcomes:

1. The Attacking (Active) Player won:

ƒThe Attacking (Active) Player gains a Trophy and Gold.

ƒThe Defending (non-Active) Player adds a 0-cost Action card to their discard pile, shuffles their deck and draws 3 cards.
For Example: If a Wolf Witcher started and won a Fight against a Bear Witcher, the Wolf Witcher takes a Bear-Witcher Trophy from its pool. The Bear Witcher does not lose any trophies gained previously.



Trophy Clarifications
ƒTrophy Limit: Each Player may have at most 1 Trophy from each other Witcher’s School.

ƒIf the Defender wins the Fight, they don’t gain a Trophy from their opponent.

The Witcher that won the fight gains Gold based on the Reputation of their opponent. The amount of Gold Player wins – 1, 2 or 3 – is shown on the Trophy Track next to their opponent’s position.
If no Wagers were placed, you can move on and skip this section.
After the Witcher Fight, if any Wagers were placed, do the following:

ƒIf a Player placed a Wager on the Witcher who lost: they move their wagered Gold to the Com-mon Pool.

ƒIf a Player placed a Wager on the Witcher who won: they take back their Wagered Gold; addi-tionally, they gain the same amount of Gold as the winner of the Fight.


As time goes by, the Witchers are getting more recog-nition and the wagers, as well as the fight rewards, are naturally growing.



Adding a 0-cost Action Card

LosingWitcher adds a 0-cost Action Card to their discard pile, as explained above.

Forming a new deck

Regardless of the result–both Witchers do the same – they each: raise their Shield level up to their Defense level, shuffle all of their Action Cards found in their deck, discard pile, and hand together to form a new deck.
After doing so, both Players will draw cards based on their performance during the fight, as detailed next:

a. The non-Active Player doesn’t proceed to Phase III like the Active Player does; instead,

[…] the prefect’s son, Olgierd, rose and gestured for silence, then proceeded to speak in florid words about the time last year when he went to the edge of the forest to ambush the beast that has been ter-rorizing the area. He was in the middle of naming all the lands he should receive for getting rid of the problem, when a witcher entered the tavern, cov-ered in blood and carrying the head of a wyvern. The boy turned pale, then purple in the face, opened his mouth like a fish out of water and ran out, not to be seen again that night. I guess some folk are all talk, while others are all action.

GAINING TROPHIES AND FATIGUE


ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageYou may gain a Trophy in 3 ways:

ƒMeditate (see page 15).

ƒYou start (and win) a Fight against another Witcher (see page 20).

ƒYou win a Fight against a Monster (see page 21).
Regardless of how you gain a Trophy, perform the fol-lowing steps:


Fatigue value
This is determined by your current position the Trophy Track.
For example: After ga ing the first Trophy, t Fatigue is 1, as indicat by the Trophy Track.



1.	Read the text at the top out loud.

2. Advance 1 spot on the Trophy Track.
If you reach the top spot, you immediately win the game! (Meditate Exception explained below.)



Meditate Exception
The game can only end from a Trophy that is obtained from a Fight; because of this, if you Meditate, and this would result in you gaining your Final Trophy (i.e., gaining this Trophy will end the game):

ƒdo not move on the Trophy track

ƒdo not suffer Fatigue.
You still take the Trophy for its ability, but the game does not end.


3. Suffer Fatigue:
Fatigue represents the toll that long fights and trav-els have taken on Witcher’s health.


Trash
This is not the same as discarding; when you Trash a card, you get rid of it for the entire game (it is returned to the game box, never to be seen again during this adventure)!
You can trash multiple cards of the same type, or all different types; all that is required is that youTrash exactly the required amount; you can-not choose to Trash more or less than what is explicitly required.
Unless otherwise specified by an effect, you can remove a card from your hand, deck, or discard pile.



Trash a number of cards equal to your Fatigue value as shown on your current position on the Trophy Track.
To do so: Search through all of your Action Cards – those in your deck, hand, and discard pile – Trash the required number of cards. Afterwards, shuffle all of your remaining Action Cards and form a deck.

4. Finally, slide the Trophy Card into the special slot on your Player Board
Trophy Cards are always displayed with theirTrophy Effect visible to all Players.

WINNING THE GAME


After one Player reaches the top spot on the Trophy Track, that Player immediately wins the game!
Remember: the game cannot end after Meditation.

solo mode


ImageImageImageImageImageSolo Mode

Set up the game as you would for a regular (2/3-player) game with the following changes:

New Solo-Help Card:
Take the Solo-Help Card and keep it nearby.
Player Setup Change:
Take 3 Gold and place it on your Player Board. Draw 5 cards from your deck.
Monster Setup Change:
Draw 1 Monster token from each Monster-token stack (3 in total; 1 each of Level I, II and III). Do this instead of drawing 3 from the Level I stack. The rest of Monster setup is the same.
Attribute Trophy Setup Change:
Shuffle one set of Attribute Trophy cards together (one of each type). Randomly draw 1 and place it near the game board face up. (Return the remaining attribute trophies to the game box.)

How to Win

Exploration Cards
Any effect that asks another Player to read something, must be read by yourself. When reading, cover the card (that you are reading) with another, so that you do not see the results until you make a choice. (If possible, do not read the result that corresponds to the choice you didn’t make.)
Fighting Monsters
During your Fights, when the Monster attacks, the attack type is determined by a Die roll: On a roll of 1-3, the type is Charge; on a 4-6, it is Bite.
Defeating a Monster
Do not draw a new Monster Card after Defeating one.
Drive a Monster Away
If you Drive a Monster Away, you still spawn a new Mon-ster of the same Level (as normal); however, Driving a MonsterAway does not count as Defeating a Monster (for the purposes of winning the game, as you do not obtain a Trophy).
Gain a new card
During Phase III, if you gain any other card than a card from the right-most spot, discard the card from the right-most spot at the end of this Phase.

Solo Dice Poker Results



To win, you must gain 4 Trophies. To do this, you’ll need to do both of the following:

1.	 Defeat all 3 monsters (that were placed during setup).

Your Result	Reward

Pair
0 Gold



2. Gain the Attribute Trophy (that was placed during	Two Pairs setup).

As in the regular game, the Attribute Trophy may not be the final Trophy that you obtain; thus, you may not Defeat the final Monster until you obtain the Attribute Trophy.
Keep track of how many turns you take during the game for final scoring purposes.

Gameplay changes

Play the game as normal, except for the following changes:
Dice Poker
All Location Actions during Phase I are the same, except for Dice Poker.
You start a game of Dice Poker as normal – you pay 1 Gold, roll 5 Dice, and then you may perform one reroll of any number of those Dice.
After that, you compare your result to the Solo-Help Card. Gain Gold based on your result (see next page).

Your Result


Not bad… for a greenhorn. You wield your sword better and better, and the power of your Signs grows. Although you are still far from the greatest among witchers, you are a hunter whom monsters cannot ignore.

You can be relied on. When given a quest, you often return with the head of the targeted beast. There are still witchers in the world who surpass you in skill, but you have nothing to be ashamed of.

This world needs a professional, and that's you! Your efforts do not go unnoticed. The first rumors of a brave witcher can be heard among the people. But the road to mastery is long -there is still a long way to go.

You are on the road to become a legend. You know your job like no other. With a sword in your hand, you become the real terror of monsters, and people know that they can feel safe with you.

You are a living legend! Bards compete in composing songs to praise your heroic deeds. Thanks to your efforts, the honor and reputation of your School are known across the Continent.

WITCHERS SPECIALTIES




School of the Viper – Venomous-Steel

Once per Fight: When your opponent discards 1 (or more) cards as a result of your Attack, you may perform your Ven-omous-Steel Ability to view and alter the order of your opponent’s top cards of their deck and (if level 2 or higher) discard their cards.

ƒAccording to the icons directly to the right of your Venomous-Steel marker, draw a number of cards from the top of your opponent’s deck; (and possibly) discard a number of them; and then
put the remaining cards back on top of your opponent’s deck in any order you choose.

ƒIf discarding cards is part of the effect, you must do it.


School of the Bear – Armor

Once per Fight: On your Turn, if your Shield level is 0, your Armor Ability au-tomatically triggers: draw cards from your deck (and if level 2 or higher, raise your Shield level).



34


School of the Cat – Speed

ImageImageImageImageImageImageOnce per Fight: During your first Fight Turn, you may perform your Speed Abil-ity to draw cards from your deck (and possibly return some to the top of the deck in any order).

School of the Wolf – Swordsmanship

Once per Fight: When you make a Combo of 3 (or more) cards, you may perform your Swordsmanship Ability to deal ad-ditional Damage (and, if level 2 or higher, draw additional cards).












!
School of the Griffin – Magic

Once per Fight: You may perform your Magic Ability to draw 1 card from the top of your discard pile; then, discard 0-2 cards from your hand.

If this ability is level 4 or 5: Look through your discard pile and pick any 1 card to add to your hand.


Note: As you raise your Specialty level, you cannot use the ability of the lower level.


LOCATION ACTIONS



Traveling and Taking Actions on the Map is done by a Player during the “Movement and Actions Phase” (see page 12). Following are the details for each Location Action:



alchemy	level




At this Location, you may gain 1 level of the Indicated Attribute, only if that Attribute’s level is equal to or lower than your Witcher Level.
For example: If your level is 1, you can increase your Combat (from level 1) to level 2; However, if your level is 1, and your Combat level is 2, you cannot increase it to level 3 by using this Location Action.
Alchemy: Any time you advance your Alchemy level, immediately gains 1 Potion taken from the top of the Potion Deck.
Defense:Any time you advance your Defense level, raise your Shield level by 1 (exception: level 5).







At three Locations with this symbol, Active Player can draw 1 Potion from the top of the Potion Deck. Potions are kept face-up near / or below Player’s Board. If you exceed the limit of 4 Potions, discard any chosen Po-tion(s) down to 4.

In two Locations, the Player may play Dice Poker with some locals.
The Player has to place 1 Gold to the pool, 2 Gold is placed in the pool from the bank.
Resolve a game of Dice Poker where the locals are rep-resented by a Player to the right of the Active Player.
If the Player is the winner, the Player takes all 3 Gold, if the locals have won, the Gold goes back to the bank.
All other rules are the same as with Witcher Dice poker (see page 14).







In that Location, the Player may trash one, chosen card from their hand, and gain one card from the 6 cards available on the Game Board.
The printed cost of a newly gained card may be lower, the same or 1 higher than the cost of the trashed card.
The Player adds the newly gained card to their hand.





35














ImageImageImageImageImage!ImageImageImageLocations with this symbol are Witcher Schools. Each Witcher School has similar effect, but Witcher Specialty can be trained only in the school that Witcher belongs to.

1.	 Choose 1 of the following Attributes to train: Combat, Defense, or Alchemy.

ƒIf you are taking that Action in your school, you may choose to train your Specialty instead.

ƒYou can’t train other School’s Specialties using this Action.

2. Pay the cost to Train that Attribute;

ƒThe cost is Gold of value equal to the current level of the Attribute + 1.
When the Player would enter that Location indicated on the token, the Player gets that Gold from the Token and turns that Token over – that Token represents a Trail for that particular Monster.
Eg. There is a contract for Harpies, that occupy a Moun-tain Location of Doldeth. The Player wants to get some intel on them, so the Player takes a Mountain Location Token. It shows Location Ard Modron. The Player places 1 Gold on that Token and the Player should try to get to it in coming Turns to get 1 Gold and a Trail Token on Harpies.


Note: If there are no Terrain Tokens of one type available in the pool, the Player may not choose to start a Trail Quest for that Terrain type.


3. Move the chosen Attribute up 1 level.

ƒYou do not have to train Attributes evenly – School training is actually a good way to spe-cialize in one (or more) Attributes.

ƒIf you cannot cover the cost, you cannot choose that Attribute to train.

Eg. The Player is taking an Action in one of the Schools. The Player chooses to train Defense, and that Player moves the Defense up by 1 level – from level 3 to level 4. The Player has to pay 4 Gold for that training.






In two Locations, the Player may talk to local people about any information they have on a Monster.
First, the Player gets 1 Gold. Then, the Player chooses one Monster that they wish to track. The Player gets a Terrain Token from the pile that the Monster is currently occupying. The Player places it face-up on their Player Board (with a Location shown) and places 1 Gold from the bank on it – it’s called a Trail Quest. It cannot be the same Location that the Player is currently at (in that case, the Player draws another token).

In that Location, the Player gets 1 Gold, if the Player has 0 Gold.
Also, the Player may trash 1 or 2 Action Cards from the 6 available in the pool on the Game Board. After doing so, the available Action Cards are moved to the right, and the pool is replenished from the common Action Card Deck.


[…] I will now try to give a detailed description of the weeks I’ve spent on the trail in the company of a witcher, back when our paths crossed in a most unexpected way!
Chronicles of Benno Kobart, excerpt from chapter XIII, Dangers on the Trail.

Dear friend,

I hope this letter reaches you in good health... Are you still having boils? The witch doctor lady that I recom-mended in the last letter has undoubtedly seen worse things before, her lousy husband’s face at the top of that list. How much this man has made my blood boil is a topic for a completely different occasion. I believe that I will be able to tell you this over a pint of harder liquor.
Meanwhile, I need to share some disturbing information with you. As I travel through the northern lands, I hear more and more often about grime, the very thought
of which makes the hair curl on the back of my neck. Being on the trail for years, I have seen a lot - ghouls, drowners, and once I even had the chance to encounter an ekimmara! However, what I am writing about today seems to be much worse.
The monsters that many believed were only legends - fairytales - designed to frighten naughty children, turned out to be real... Terrifyingly real! Almost every
day, I hear rumors of more travelers who have stumbled upon one of these mighty beasts.

Yesterday, I received information that forced me to reach to you, my friend. These legendary beasts are getting bolder. They recently crushed the cities of Poviss and Kovir to dust; the local population lost their homes, and was forced to flee to Kaedwen. However, it is only
a matter of time until it is no longer safe there as well.

Fortunately, I also heard that the witchers already know everything. They will have to abandon vampire and necrophage assignments for a while to deal with these -more pressing - matters. The lesser evils can wait.
The world will not be at peace until the witchers deal with this issue. I sincerely believe they can do it; how-ever, if something happened to me, I also send you the key to a bank locker, in an envelope. There you will find further instructions.
Hopefully, you won’t have to use them. May Melitele protect you.

First, setup the base game as normal. After, proceed to setup the Legendary Hunt as follows:
ƒThe remaining Legendary Monster cards and min-iatures are returned to the box.



1.	A large help card 1 is placed near theTrophy track:
ƒThe first time you use the expansion, use the “A”
side of the card. 2
ƒSide “A” is the basic version of the expansion; but if you decide you would prefer a longer game, use the “B” side.

2. Players choose (or randomly determine) a Legendary Monster to use:
ƒPlace its large card 3 near the Main Board.
3. Shuffle the Special Fight cards 6 and place it near the large Monster card. (These cards are only used when fighting the Legendary Monster.)

4. The Player sitting to the right of the starting Player
(called the last Player in this rulebook) shuffles the 12 Legendary Monster Movement cards 7 together and places it as a face-down deck near themself.
(See Legendary Monster Movement below for what to do with these cards.)
5. All Destruction tokens 8 are shuffled face-down and kept near the Main Board.

While playing with the Legendary Hunt Expansion, the	18 overall gameplay remains the same with some changes
explained in this rulebook. The biggest change is the win condition; now, to win the game, the Player needs to kill a Legendary Monster. The first Player to do so immediately wins the game.

The secondary Location, depicted with a small Location number.




The number of Movements, depending on the number of Players in the game.




The Legendary Monster is present on the board from the beginning of the game.

Players may freely move onto and out of the Location occupied by the Legendary Monster. Players are not affected when the Legendary Monster moves into (or through) their Location.
1.	For each Movement, the Legendary Monster is moved onto the neighboring Location that is clos-est to the main Location. The Legendary Monster cannot be moved onto Destruction tokens during Legendary Monster Movement!

2. If there are 2 equally close Locations, the last Player chooses which of the two Locations (without a De-struction token) the Monster moves onto.

3. If the Legendary Monster is occupying the main Lo-cation on the card, it moves toward the secondary Location, following steps 1 and 2.

4. If all of the closest Locations each contain a Destruc-tion token, the last Player chooses any neighboring Location (without a Destruction token) to move it to.

5. If all neighboring Locations contain a Destruction token, this Movement, and all consecutive Move-ments this Turn are ignored.



Players may not use the Location Action of the Location occupied by the Legendary Monster. To remember it, place the Legendary Monster miniature on that Location Action.

A 2-Player Game Example

1.	The Player draws a Legendary Monster Movement card. It’s a 2-Player game so the Legendary Monster performs 2 Movements.



LEGENDARY MONSTER MOVEMENT


After the last Player takes their Turn, they reveal the top card of the Movement deck to determine how the Leg-endary Monster moves. (This essentially occurs at the end of the Round, after each Player has taken a Turn.) Each Movement card has three pieces of information:

Players execute all the Movements shown on the card one by one:

2. The Legendary Monster is occupying the main Lo-cation, so the last Player chooses the neighboring Location closest to the secondary Location (18) and moves the Legendary Monster to it.

3. The last Player places 1 face-down Destruction token on Location the Legendary Monster moved from.

4. According to the Legendary Monster Movement card, the Legendary Monster moves twice during this Turn. The last Player repeats 2nd and 3rd steps, moving the Legendary Monster to the next closest Location (11).

ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageLegendary Hunt Movement Clarifications

ƒClosest Location: a Location along a path that would require the least number of movement spaces to reach the marked Location.

ƒEach time the Legendary Monster leaves a Location, place 1 face-down Destruction token on the Location that the Monster just left. Place it on the Location art, so the Lo-cation Action is still visible and available.

ƒMultiple Destruction tokens may be placed during the same Turn.

ƒAfter completing the top-most Movement shown on the card, the last Player performs the next movement (if any), and so on.

ƒIf the deck of the Movement cards ever runs out, shuffle its discard pile to create a new deck.


DRIVING THE LEGENDARY MONSTER AWAY


After performing at least one Movement in your Turn, you may decide to drive the Legendary Monster away. To do it, you must share the same Location with the Legendary Monster, then perform the following steps (in order) on your Turn:

FIGHTING THE LEGENDARY MONSTER
Legendary Monster Protection

The Legendary Monster has a level of Monster Protec-tion that depends on the Player’s position on theTrophy Track. It is shown on the large help card.



Players may decide to attack the Legendary Monster just like any other Monster.
For the a side, the level of Monster Protection is 3/2/1/0.



If you have 1 or more face-down Destruction tokens, you take the first Fight Turn. Otherwise, the Legendary Monster takes the first Fight Turn.

The Player controlling the Legendary Monster shuffles all 20 Special Fight cards into a deck. Then, they put away a number of cards equal to the number of Destruc-tion tokens that the attacking Player has.

The remaining cards are the Legendary Monster’s Life Pool.

The attacking Player keeps their Destruction tokens.
For the b side, it is 4/3/2/1/0.

solo mode



The goal of the game is to hunt down the Legendary Monster before it brings too much destruction to the Continent.

While playing with the Legendary Hunt expansion, the overall solo gameplay remains the same as the standard solo mode with some changes explained below.

SETUP


The setup follows the rules explained above with few differences:

Place 3 Monsters in the pool - a Level I Monster, a Level II Monster, and a Level III Monster.

Use the Solo help card that is part of the basic game components.

The Player decides whether they use the “A” or “B” side of the large help card.

Create a pool of a face-down Legendary Monster Move-ment cards and put the remaining ones (without looking at them) in the game box. The size of the pool depends on the difficulty level you choose:
GAMEPLAY


The gameplay follows the rules explained above with few differences:

ƒIf the Legendary Monster is unable to perform the Movement, the Player draws 1 Legendary Mon-ster Movement card and places it on the top of the Legendary Monster Movement cards discard pile. They do not place the Destruction token on the Game Board.

ƒIf the Player kills a Monster and gains the Trophy, they do not replace it with another Monster. If they drive the Monster away, they replace it with a new Monster of the same level as the driven away Mon-ster.

ƒIf the Player drives the Legendary Monster away, they do not draw a Legendary Monster Movement card. Instead, they choose any connected Location (without a Destruction token).

ƒThe Legendary Monster’s Life Pool is decreased by 1 card for every 2 Destruction tokens the Player possesses (rounded down).




Easy	Normal	Hard

The Player wins the game if they manage to kill the Legendary Monster.

The Player loses the game if, at any point during the game, they need to draw a Legendary Monster Move-ment card and the deck is empty.

There are - at least - two reasons why I find it ex-tremely difficult to write anything about magic.
ImageImageImageImageImageFirst, it is a vast field, the secrets of which are avail-able only to a small handful of gifted elects. It is good for the chosen ones to come from wealthy homes; although, apparently for quite some time, it has not been necessary anymore. The knowledge that can be acquired without being gifted yourself is not very broad, and probably not much of what I write here will surprise you, dear reader.
There are two academies that train magic practi-tioners: the girls-only college in Aretuza and - con-sidered inferior by many - the boys’ school in Ban Ard.
Mages learn to draw energy from the elements such as fire, water, air, and earth. They also exercise the mind; because without enormous knowledge and mental strength, a wizard can easily lose control of magic and become a plaything in the hands of unpredictable power.
Wizards are much more respected than witchers, and they would never agree to be put on the same
level. But I’ve heard of magicians who, like mutants, they don’t want to associate with so much, go out into the thicket to hunt dangerous beasts. Supposedly, many magical ingredients are necessary for exper-iments, and brewing potions can be extracted from excised monsters. Wizards constantly dream of more power, so it’s no wonder that they eagerly reach for newer - and more dangerous - ways to get it.
The second reason I don’t want to go too deep into magic is much more prosaic. Wizards are, for the most part, beings that treat themselves seriously, and they take any unflattering attention deeply per-sonally. As a dreadful combo, they have an extraor-dinary memory that allows them to cultivate hatred in their hearts and plan revenge for a long time. The last thing I wish for is to get under a wizards skin as a result of unfortunate vocabulary, misinformation, or a simple mistake - so here I will end.

Since there are differences on how to prepare and play the game when all Players decide to play as Mages, and when only some do so, you need to decide on the way you are going to proceed before step 2 of the standard Setup rules.

Depending on the chosen way to play the game, follow the steps explained in one of two sections below.

ALL PLAYERS DECIDE TO PLAY AS MAGES


Setup changes:

ƒPlayers do not use the Action cards found in the basic game. Instead, a deck of Mage Action cards is used. Basic Action cards are placed back in the game box.

ƒPlayers shuffl	on deck and place it where the sta                              d be placed 1 (the Game Board e                              eeded). The first six available card                            ce up following the standard rule
b






SOME, BUT NOT ALL PLAYERS DECIDE TO PLAY AS MAGES


Setup changes:

ƒPlayers use both the basic Action cards and the Mage Action cards for the entirety of the game. First, place the Game Board extension 1 to create space for two s	ks. Then, shuffle each deck separately                        cards from each deck (following the                         es). That way, there
should be 6 Wi	cards 2 and 6 Mage
Action cards 3 1

1	2	2





ƒAfter each Pla	he Mage (any meth-od they choos                              layer is chosen, the last Player go                               g their “School”. The Player choose                             hool and places their School token                             e School symbol on the Game Board. The Player also places their Spe-cialty token b to cover the Specialty printed on the Game Board, and places their Mage miniature
c on that Location. Then, the next Player in the counter-clockwise order chooses any School that is not yet chosen and claims it to be their School for that game. Players do so, until all have claimed their School.

The remaining setup for Mages is identical to the regular game setup.
ƒAfter each Pl	the Witcher or the Mage that th                              (any method they choose), and                                chosen, the Mages need to claim                              ation. The Mage that will take their                             es the Location first, then all other Mages choose a Location in count-er-clockwise order.

ƒThe Player chooses any of the Witcher Schools that are not present in the game and places their School token covering the School symbol on the Game Board. The Player also places their Specialty token to cover the Specialty printed on the Game Board and place their Mage miniature on that Location.

The remaining setup for Mages is identical to the regular game setup.

SOME, BUT NOT ALL PLAYERS DECIDE TO PLAY AS MAGES



Gameplay changes:

ƒWhenever a game rule or component refers to a Witcher, treat it as if it instead says Mage or Witch-er, depending on the situation. If a game rule or component refers to Witchers treat it as if it instead says Mages and Witchers.

ƒWhenever any Player gains an Action card in any way, they choose a card from their respective pool or deck, following all standard rules (e.g. a Witcher can not gain Mage cards).

ƒWhenever any Player is allowed to discard Action cards (eg. using Vizima Location Action), they may choose cards from either pool in any combination.



For example: A Witcher gains the rightmost card from
their pool, takes it into their hand a, and the rightmost
Mage Action card b is discarded. Each card pool is
moved right c and replenished with a new card.
ƒMages may fight one another, Witchers may fight Mages and vice-versa.

ƒMages can pay Gold to train their Specialty on their School Location, as shown on the Specialty Token placed there during the game setup.

Mages replace the Defense Attribute with Wisdom. Mages also do not have a Shield level, and they gather and spend Energy instead.

Gathering Energy

ƒWhenever a Mage would raise or lower their Shield level, they raise or lower their Energy level instead.

ƒWhenever the game refers to the Player’s Shield, the Player playing as a Mage treats it as Energy. (Exception: a Mage does not lower their Energy level after taking Damage.)

ƒWhenever a Mage raises their Wisdom level, they immediately raise their Energy level by 1.

ƒEnergy is spent and gained during Fights. During Fights, Energy can exceed the Mage’s Wisdom level (different from the rule for Shields).

ƒAfter a Fight, the Energy level is raised up to that Mage’s Wisdom level.

That icon appears on Mage Action cards and Specialties. When a Player uses such a card or Specialty, they raise their Energy level by 1.

Card draw increase/d the Player’s Fight Tu

NEW


Mage Action cards have the same colors as standard Witcher Action cards, so when any effect in the game refers to a specific type and color, it can affect both Witch-er and Mage cards.

But Mages Action cards represent the different Spells which belong to 5 different branches:

Blue - Water	Red - Fire
Yellow - Air	Green - Earth	Purple - Mind



Spending Energy

Mage Action cards are used similarly to basic Action cards. A Player gets a starting deck, builds it, and uses it to travel and fight. The cards have different effects explained below, but many of them have a new ability that allows boosting it by spending Energy.

After creating a card Combo, the standard rules require Players to resolve its effects in a specific order. While playing as a Mage the Player resolves cards in their Combo one-by-one, from left to right.

Protection

Mages do not have Shields, and all re-ceived Damage requires them to discard
cards from the top of the deck (then from their hand when empty).

Mages can protect themselves from receiving Damage by gathering Protection. Protection gathered by a Mage only affects the very next opponent’s Fight Turn. Even if your enemy doesn’t deal Damage, the Protection is lost at the end of their Turn.

The Protection reduces only the regular Damage. When the effect forces a Player to discard a card from their hand or deck, the Protection does not apply.

Examples:

Draw any 1 chosen card from the discard pile.
Search your discard pile to take any 1 card (adding it to your hand). You can not change the order of cards in the discard pile while doing so.




Deal Damage according to your Energy level.



1.     During your Fight Turn, you gain 2 Protection. Next, you are attacked by a Monster, and they deal 4 Damage, but your Protection reduces this by 2, so you actually only receive 2 Damage.

2. During your FightTurn, you gain 2 Protection. Next, you are attacked by a Monster, and the effect forces you to discard 2 cards from your hand. As you have got only 1 card in your hand, you discard it; then, you discard 1 card from your deck. The Protection does not apply and is lost with no effect.

3. During your Fight Turn, you gain 3 Protection. Next, you are attacked by a Witcher who uses a Potion to deal 2 Damage, both of which is annulled by the Protection, but there is 1 Protection left (only until the end of the Fight Turn). Then, the Witch-er creates a card Combo dealing 4 Damage, 1 is decreased by the remaining Protection, and you receive 3 Damage.

Alternatively, the Witcher could have played a dif-ferent card Combo to raise their Shield level instead (dealing no Damage) – that way, 3 Protection that you gained would be lost with no effect.


Gather Protection according to your Energy level.





Increase your draw by the number equal to your Energy level. Remember to resolve that effect during the 4th step of your Fight Turn along with all other draw modifications.





Raise your Energy level by 1.




Treat this card as if it had a Combo Extension of any color.

The witcher stopped, feeling a shiver of anxiety running down his neck. There had been absolute silence in the forest for some time. The sound of the birds that had accompanied him for the last few hours had died down. There was also no sign of wild game anywhere.
ImageImageImageImageImage“Anyone who goes too far never comes back from the forest,” one of the villagers had said the previous evening. “The forest now belongs to a werewolf... or some other devil.”
The peasant, of course, was wrong. The scraps of truth picked up from the tales of the villagers made it clear that it was a devil - not a werewolf - who liked the local thickets.
The witcher crouched down, noticing a fresh trail in the undergrowth. His hunch was right; it was a Fiend, and quite a big one at that...
He reached to his waist to make sure the bomb, called the ‘Devil’s Puffball’, was strapped in place. Then he took a small vial from his pouch and un-
corked it. He applied special oil to the blade with practiced precision.
In the fight against a beast that can kill a rider and its horse with one stroke of the paw... there are no holds barred. Moreover, they are absolutely es-sential.
Straightening up, he saw movement at the edge of his field of vision. A dark shape flitted through the bushes. The witcher closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
He was ready...

And I? I was sitting in the village then, waiting for his return from the forest with the others. And he came back, of course - barely standing up actually - but he crawled back. And after they had sewed and put him back together, he collected the prize... and we went on.

Setup and gameplay remain the same except for not-ed changes detailed for each mode below.

MANTICORE SCHOOL WITCHER


When choosing to use this, the Manticore School Witch-er is used as any other Witcher in the base game. That Witcher has their own School Location and Witcher components.
When choosing to use this, shuffle all Mutagen cards together (to form the Mutagen deck) and place them face-down near the Potion deck.

During the game, each time you reach a next Level, instead of drawing 1 or 2 cards (as shown on your Player Board), you get a new Mutagen card.

When you get a new Mutagen card, draw 3 cards from the top of the Mutagen deck, choose 1 of them and shuf-fle 2 remaining cards back with the deck. Put the chosen Mutagen in your play area.

When you get 2 Mutagen cards (by reaching the 4th and 5th Level), go through the steps described above two times.

Each Mutagen card has an Ability that can be used during the Fight. Each Mutagen that the Player owns, can be used once per Fight.


















Potion Tolerance Specialty:

Once per Fight: during your Fight Turn, you may discard 1 unused Potion (if lev-el 1, discard 2 Potions) to perform your Potion Tolerance Specialty and deal Damage (and, if level 3 or higher, draw 2 cards).


TROLL MONSTER


When choosing to use this, add the Troll Monster to the Monster pool.

The Troll Monster has a card and a token (if using the Deluxe version, it has a miniature).
BOMB CARDS




ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageI have already written about potions that would send an ordinary mortal to the grave, as for the witchers - on the contrary - they allow them to endure longer in battle. However, it must be honestly admitted that all these potions are only a part of the alchemical specifics that witchers can prepare.

You can carry up to 4 Potion and Bomb cards each (i.e., 8 cards in total).

During a Fight, you may use a combined number of Potion and/or Bomb cards equal to, or lower than your Alchemy Level.

Bombs do not count as Potions (e.g., if an effect says, “discard Potions”, ignore Bombs you have).

Dimeritium Bomb explained:



Bombs are of particular interest to me, although I rarely have met those who use them. They said that - yes - the right bomb on hand would not hurt, but its preparation is expensive, and requires a lot of time. Therefore, only those who knew that they had a really demanding fight ahead of them made sure they had it at hand. A pity, because it is a view to admire!
The Chronicles of Benno Kobart, a fragment of chapter XVII, Swords and Stones, or How We Made Everything a Deadly Weapon.



When choosing to use this, shuffle all Bomb cards to-gether (to form the Bomb deck) and place them face-down near the Potion deck.

This Bomb has a special ability that works on if you use the “Monst Weakness and Speci Attacks” Game Mod
If you are not using th mode, put Dimeritiu Bomb cards back in the game box.



ADVANCED




Against a Witcher: use before creating the Life Pool. Temporarily, during this Fight only, your opponent’s Specialty level is lowered to 1.












Potion deck



Bomb deck





During the game, each tim	ion card (from any effect for any reason) you must immediately make a choice; either:

ƒDraw 1 Potion from the top of the Potion deck as normal, or

ƒDiscard 1 Potion or 1 Gold to draw the top card from the Bomb deck instead.
[...] I will not say that I am a combat or fencing master, because I had the sword in my hand only once… when I was asked to take it to the armorer. But I saw ‘things’ in my life. I was, among other things, a witness of a tav-ern murder, in which the witcher from the Viper school took a powerful punch on the ribs with his chair leg, and a moment later, he was in a battle trance and knocked down four biggies before the others even realized who had hit them! I do not hesitate to say, that among the top ten warriors on the continent, at least seven are adepts from one of the witcher schools. What a well-trained witcher can do in combat is indescribable. I wish you, reader, to see for yourself one day - but not feel on your own skin at the same time!
The Chronicles of Benno Kobart, excerpt from Chapter XVI, What is a Witcher?



There are 10 different types of Advanced Action cards in the game, 4 copies of each.

When choosing to use this, you may immediately add all 40 Advanced Action cards at once, or do it gradual-ly. If you choose to add them gradually, choose what types of cards to add, then add all 4 cards of each of the chosen types.

All chosen cards are shuffled with the main Action deck, before the Action card pool is prepared on the main board.

All Advanced Action cards have text explanations on 1

ome cards require you to trash card (from your hand) as part f the cost to purchase it. When urchasing such a card, the layer chooses 1 card from their and and trashes it. When gain-

a card is the only cost.

Interesting things, however, result from witcher animos-ity. You can get the impression that each school wants to stand out, and shine from the rest. From an early age, they prepare students in their own ways, believing that their ideas will bring the best results. Who’s right? I am not the one to judge.
The Chronicles of Benno Kobart, excerpt from Chapter XVI, What is a Witcher?


When choosing to use this, add the Unique card to each Witcher staring deck.

Each card has the Witcher’s art depicted on it, so you can quickly determine which deck to add it to.

Each Player now begins the game with 11 cards in their starting deck.



You can not choose a card with a trash cost from the Vengerberg Location Action, or any effect telling you to take a 0, 1, or 2-cost card.

However, when told to gain can choose a card with a tra to trash a card in this case t

Rolling dice

Cards may tell you to roll dice; depending on the result, the effect chang-es.







When also using Mages:

Each Mage starting deck also gets 1 Unique Action card. Each card has the Mage’s art depicted on it, so you can quickly determine which deck to add it to.

MONSTER WEAKNESS AND SPECIAL ATTACKS



ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImage’’’’’ImageImage’’ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageGame Setup:

When choosing to use this, use the large Monster cards (instead of the regular-sized ones), both during game setup and when new Monsters are spawned.

The regular-sized Monster cards are kept in a pile near the Game Board; they are still used as Trophies after a player kills a Monster.

Instead of keeping the three Monster cards on the Game Board, Players should keep them near it.

The large Monster cards have two sides and Players should keep the side with Special Attacks face-up 1 . Players may look at both of the sides of the large Mon-ster cards at any time.

















There are three sets of Monster Weakness Tokens, each set contains 6 tokens (for a total of 18 tokens). Shuffle and keep them face-down and separate from the Loca-tion Tokens.

repeated – if needed – until a Weakness Token is placed on a Location containing no Witchers.











After 3 different Weakness Tokens are placed face-down on the map, all Location Tokens revealed during this step are shuffled back together.

There are 4 Special Attack cards in this Expansion.








Players shuffle the regular 20 Monster Fight cards and draw 4 of them – those cards are placed face-down back in the game box and are not used.

Another 4 regular Monster Fight cards are placed face-down near the large Monster cards. Those will appear in the game later.

The remaining 12 Monster Fight cards are shuffled to-gether with the 4 Special Attack cards to create a 16-card Monster Attack Deck. When fighting with a Monster, Players draw an appropriate number of cards from that deck. After the Monster Fight, all the 16 cards are shuf-fled back together.

When a Level 3 Monster appears in the game for the first time, the 4 Monster Fight cards, that were placed aside before, are added to the deck. At this point it should include 20 cards and remains that way for the remainder of the game.

face-up	face-down
Gameplay:


After the three starting Monsters are placed on the Game Board, Players draw 1 Location Token of a corresponding Terrain Type for each Monster, and place a random face-down Weakness Token on that Location. If there are 1 (or more) Witchers at that Location, discard this token and draw another Location Token instead. These steps are
Weakness Tokens:

Entering a Location with a Weakness Token

When the Player enters a Location with a Weakness Token, they reveal it immediately and place it next to the Player Board.

Then, the Player reads the paragraph on the large Mon-ster card that occupies the same Terrain Type as the token revealed – the number on the token shows which paragraph to read.

The firs	on, and the	hat Player g	ter.

The Pla	ce-up on t	ple Weakne	me or differ

After reading the paragraph, a new Weakness Token, with the same Terrain Type, is placed on the Game Board. In order to do so, a Location Token (with the same Terrain Type) is drawn, and the Weakness Token is placed there face-down.

If there is a Witcher in that Location, a new Location To-ken is drawn. These steps are repeated – if needed – until a Weakness Token is placed on a Location containing no Witchers. Then, all Location Tokens revealed during this step are shuffled back together. In other words – there should always be 3 different Weakness Tokens face-down on the Game Board.

If there is no Location token with the sameTerrainType in the pool, the Player to the right of the Active Player chooses any Location of that Terrain Type, and the Weak-ness Token is placed there.

The only exception to the above rule is a situation, when all 6 Weakness Tokens have been collected already. In this situation, a new Weakness Token is not placed on the Game Board.

Using Weakness Tokens during the Fight

When a Player begins the Fight with a Monster, before it begins, they may use all of their Weakness Tokens for that particular Monster. The Player does not discard used Weakness Tokens, unless the text on Monster’s card says to do it.

The Player may decide to use only some of their Weak-ness Tokens in the Fight.

Clean-Up after the Fight

If the Monster remains on the Game Board after the Fight, the Player keeps their Weakness Tokens.

If the Monster was killed or driven away, all Players must give back the Weakness Tokens related to that Monster back to the pool. Then, all 6 Weakness Tokens are shuf-fled together face-down.

After a new Monster is placed on the Game Board, Play-ers place 1 Weakness token, following the steps in the Game Setup of that Mode.

Special Monster Attacks:

While you play the game with this Mode, you use large Monster cards.

Each card shows Life Pool and a Monster Ability that is exactly the same as on their regular Monster cards.

The card also has a description of 4 Special Attacks and a Passive Attack Ability.

In the Monster Life Pool there will most likely be one or more Special Monster Attacks.

1.	If the Special Monster Attack card is revealed during the Monster Attack, the Special Attack is activated, regardless if “Charge” or “Bite” was chosen.

An appropriate description from the large Monster card is read and the effect is applied.

2. The Special Monster Attack card may also be re-vealed as a Result of Damage dealt by the Player.

If that happens, the Player controlling the Monster Life Pool stops discarding any further cards.

The Special Passive Ability is read, and the effect applied.

Then, if any additional Damage was sup-posed to be dealt, the Player continues to discard the cards.

It is possible to activate a Passive Ability more than once during the same Fight Turn.

Gaining a Monster Trophy:

If the Player defeats the Monster they gain the Trophy of that Monster. They search through the pile of regular Monster cards to find it and place it face up below their Player Board. The large Monster card of that Monster is put back into the box.

MONSTER TRAIL AND OTHER EXPANSIONS


ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageThe MonsterTrail may be combined with some other Expansions. During the first game with this Expan-sion, we suggest not to use any other Expansion. When Players are familiar with this Expansion, they may use the Monster Trail Expansion with:

ƒMages Expansion

ƒLegendary Hunt Expansion

ƒAdventure Pack Expansion

ƒSkellige Expansion

ƒWild Hunt Expansion.

If you combine Monster Trail and Wild Hunt Expan-sions, keep in mind that the gameplay may be more difficult or easier depending on the game modes you use.

Every year, as we approach the winter solstice, or Midinváerne in Elvish, the first snow and frost on the meadows reminds me of my journey to the Skellige archipelago. Believe me, dear reader, that not even last year’s winter, called the ‘winter of the century’ by many in Kaedwen, can be compared to the weather on these mountainous islands. I’ve only visited Skellige once, and I feel the need to openly admit that the memories I brought back with me are a mixed bag.
ImageImageImageImageImageImageThe islanders are an interesting people. It’s not easy to form a deep relationship with Skelligans, as if their thick pelts and furs protect them not only from the cold, but also from making friends. Note, however, that once an islander calls you their friend, you’ll now have a friend for life.
And a worthy friend it is indeed, for Skelligans are honorable and loyal. They don’t waste time playing courtly games or employing stratagems, but rather resolve their conflicts quickly and firmly, through force of argument, or force of arms, de-pending on the matter.
I never saw fighting between the islanders, but I did witness rival clans – for Skelligan society is divided into clans - burying the hatchet. I doubt anyone on the continent could keep up with the
drinking that occurred on that occasion, and I must add that the spirits on the archipelago are of the highest quality. Better moonshine can’t be found anywhere - except perhaps for the dwarven keeps of Mahakam. Clearly the biting cold of the islands has led to the development of spirits that can warm a man from the inside.
Why then, you ask, are my memories from Skellige a mixed bag?
The harsh weather makes the people strong, but also makes various beasts more fierce than those we see on the Continent. I’ve heard of were-wolves that can tear witchers to shreds, and ice gi-ants that can hurl a block of ice dozens of fathoms.
I also heard talk of Dagon, an underwater crea-ture many see as a god. Skelligans don’t like to talk about Dagon. They are brave, but not stupid. They know there are creatures in this world too terrifying to face, and Dagon is one of them.
If you decide to visit the archipelago, you are in for an adventure to remember. Taste the fresh fish, and feel the warmth of a bear’s pelt, but beware – the waters of the Great Sea hide many perils.

4. Place the Skellige Event cards 4 face-down without shuffling, on a designated spot on the Skellige Board. The topmost card should have a number	on its back.
5. Place the Dagon miniature 5 on the appropriate spot of the Danger Track:

a. In a 1-Player game, use the spot marked

8. Look at the bottom part of each Harbor token – 3 of
them have a Ship icon	on them. Place 1 Ship
miniature near each of those 3 Harbors 8 . During the game keep Harbor tokens near corresponding Loca-tions on the side with the anchor face-up.

Continue the standard game setup. It is possible that 1 or more Monsters will appear on an Island Location.

ImageImageImageImageImageImageThe game structure and the goal of the game remain the same while playing with the Skellige Expansion. All the changes in Skellige are explained below
NEW LOCATIONS


There are 3 Locations on the Map Extension. For all game purposes, all those Locations are treated as any other Lo-cation. Three corresponding Location tokens are mixed with the standard Location tokens, so Monsters can ap-pear on the Island Locations, and resolving Quests may require the Player to visit one of those Locations.


Location Actions:

The Player chooses 1 of the following options:

ƒThey pick a 0-cost card from the 6 cards available on the Main Board and add it to their discard pile. The Player cannot perform this Location Action if there is no 0-cost card in the pool. After, replenish the Action card pool as normal, described in the main rulebook.

ƒThey lose 1 Gold and pick a 1-cost card from the 6 cards available on the Main Board and add it to their discard pile. The Player cannot perform this Location Action if there is no 1-cost card in the pool. After, replenish the Action card pool as normal, de-scribed in the main rulebook.

Eyna





If the Player has no Level-1 or Level-2 Monster Trophy cards, the Player randomly picks a Level-1 Monster token from the pool. Then, they get their corresponding Trophy card and slide that card under their Player Board, so the Trophy Ability is visible.

The Monster token is discarded.

The Player do not move up on the Trophy track and they do not suffer Fatigue.

If the Player has 1 or more Level-1 or Level-2 Monster Tro-phy cards, they choose 1 and discard it.

If it was a Trophy of a Level-1 Monster, the Player randomly draws a Level-2 Monster token from the pool and follows the steps as described above.

If it was a Trophy of a Level-2 Monster, the Player random-ly draws a Level-3 Monster token from the pool and fol-lows the steps as described above.

New Islands

ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageDuring their travels, Players may also discover other Is-land Locations. They may be found in the Skellige Event cards deck. In that case, the Player places the Skellige Event card with a new Island Location next to the other Island Locations shown on the Skellige Board. From now on, each Player can sail from a Continent Location with a Harbor Token to one of the newly discovered Island Lo-cations.

In order not to spoil the surprise for you, the Location Ac-tions of the Island Locations from the Skellige Event card deck are described on the last page of this rulebook.

There are 3 Island Locations to choose from, but more can appear during the game.

2. The Player moves their miniature to the Ship.

3. The Player rolls a die and compares the result with
the spot on the Danger Track a currently occupied
by Dagon.
a. If the outcome matches the upper range b of
results – the Ship travel is “safe”.
Move the Dagon up by 1 spot c on the Danger
Track.



TRAVELLING BY SHIPS	c



The only way to reach the Island Locations is to travel by Ship. There are 3 Ships in the game.

There can only be 1 Ship on 1 Island or Continent Location. If a Player finished their Turn on an Island Location, that Location cannot be visited by any other Player until they leave it.

The Player can use Ships to travel from the Continent Lo-cation to one of the Island Locations (or back). The Player cannot use Ships to travel:

When a Player moves to the Location with a Ship, after performing the Location Action, they may decide to trav-el to an Island Location. They may also choose to do so when they begin their Turn on a Location that has a Ship on it.

(The results of moving Dagon to the topmost spot are explained later in this rulebook, see page 9.)
b. If the outcome matches the bottom range d of
results – the Ship travel is “dangerous”.

4. The Player to the right of the Active Player takes the top Skellige Exploration card and reads the appropri-ate section of it to the traveling Player.

a. If the travel is “safe” they read the upper section e of the Skellige Exploration card.

b. If the travel is “dangerous” they read the bottom section f of the Skellige Exploration card.





The Player may only travel from a Continent Location to an Island Location from a Harbor Location that has a Ship on it.

The Player may travel from a Continent Location to an Is-land Location only once per Turn.

When the Player decides to travel from a Continent Loca-tion with a Ship, they take the following steps:

You step ashore after a calm sea voyage and your at-tention is immediately drawn by the smell of freshly cooked fish on the stone jetty. There is no one to be found nearby. It would be a shame to leave someone’s meal to the seagulls.
You finish eating to see a group of people in long robes emerge from the thicket covering the dunes.
‘Our offering… eaten?! You’ll pay for this!’
You manage to escape, and your full stomach is a wel-come change after the last few days.
Draw 1 card from your deck.

As you come ashore you see a group of people in long robes gathered around a stone plinth. ‘Behold, the offering for Dagon comes to us!’ they shout at your sight. While you manage to escape, a dog belonging to one of the cultists leaves a deep wound in your calf.
Dress the wound yourself. Find someone who can help.
You are left with a nasty scar. Discard 2 Potions.

1.	The Player plays a card with a Terrain Type matching the Location that they want to reach.

They may also play a card that does not match the Location and pay 1 Gold or play any 2 cards.
The wound starts to rankle before you can reach the settlement. This isn’t good.
During Phase III, draw 1 card less.

ImageImageImageImageImageImageImage5. Unless the Travel Action is affected in any way, the active Player reaches the Island Location that they declared to be the destination in Step 1.

a. Then, the Player may perform the Location Action and resolve any Quests or Trail Quests they have.

b. The Player may decide to continue their Phase I by traveling back to the Continent or end their Phase I there (either to Fight a Monster that is there or because they simply decide to do so).

One Exploration Limit:

When the Player has a Skellige Exploration card read to them, when they Travel from the Continent to the Island Locations, they do not Explore in the Phase II of their Turn. If they were to do so, they simply skip that step and move to Phase III.

The Player may get a Skellige Exploration card and then Fight or Meditate during Phase II.


TRAVELING FROM AN ISLAND BACK TO THE CONTINENT



When the Player travels from an Island Location back to the Continent they take the following steps:

1.	The Player plays a card with a Terrain Type matching the Harbor Location on the Continent that they want to reach.

They may also play a card that doesn’t match the Lo-cation and pay 1 Gold or play any 2 Cards.

There are 6 Harbor Locations on the Continent but re-member that there can only be 1 Ship in each Harbor.

2. Then the Player moves their miniature to the Ship, moves the Ship to the chosen Location, and places the min-iature there.



Remember: You do not read the Skellige Explora-tion card during the travel back to the Continent.



The Player may perform Location Action of that Loca-tion, following standard rules, and they may continue with their Phase I.

The Player can perform that Travel up to two times in one Turn. It may happen only when they begin the Turn on the Island Location, Ship back to the Continent, Ship to one of the Island Locations, and then back to the Continent.

A 2-Player Game Example
The Player begins their Turn in Cidaris with 3 cards in their hand. They play a card with a Mountain Terrain Icon to move to Cintra. After, they perform the Location Action to draw 1 Potion.





















There is a Ship in that Location, so the Player decides to move to the Island Location - Ard Skellig. They play anoth-er card with a Mountain Terrain Icon from their hand and place their Witcher miniature on the Ship.

The Player rolls a die and compares the result with the Da-gon Track. The result is 5 so the Player to the right reads the Active Player the upper section of the Exploration card, and Dagon moves up on its track.























After the Exploration card is resolved, the Player moves the Ship miniature with their Witcher miniature to Ard Skellig. Now, the Player performs the Island Location Action. They raise their Combat level by 1.


























8


The Player still has 1 card left in their hand. They play it. There is a Water Terrain icon on this card. Since there are Ships in Kaer Seren and Glenmore, the Player cannot move there. They move the Ship miniature with their Witcher miniature to Cidaris and perform the Location Action.



























ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageThe Player’s hand is empty, so they decide to end Phase I of their Turn. Since they have the Skellige Exploration card read, they do not Explore during Phase II of their Turn. They proceed to Phase III.

Moving Dagon to the topmost spot of the Danger Track

When Dagon moves to the topmost spot on the Dagon track (the Dagon Lo-
cation) it emerges.

It may happen when a Player is trav-eling to an Island Location and the Player rolls 5 or 6 on the die (step
3 of traveling from Continent to an Island). In that scenario:
ƒThe Sea Travel is “safe” and the Player to their right reads the upper section of the Skellige Exploration card.

ƒThe Active Player is also affected by the Dagon emerging. The Play-er lowers their Shield level to 0 and gains a Dagon Trail token.

ƒThen the Player reaches their destination and con-tinues their Phase I.

It may also happen as an effect of a Skellige Exploration card. Then the Player that is now performing a Sea Travel to the Island Locations loses all their Shields and gains a Dagon Trail token, and reaches their destination contin-ues Phase I.

Dagon can also emerge as a result of an Event card or different special effects. If that happens, and no Player is performing a Sea Travel, Dagon emerges but no one is affected.




Dagon Location Clarifications

Dagon Location is a spot on the top of Dagon Track. Players cannot move to the Dagon Loca-tion until Dagon reaches that spot. Players cannot move to the Dagon Location from an Island Loca-tion; it is possible to get there only from a Conti-nent Location.

There may be more than 1 Ship on the Dagon Location (which means that there may be more than 1 Player on that Location).

If Dagon is driven away and placed back on the bottom spot of its track, Players cannot move to this Location until it emerges again. They can only move from this Location back to a Continent Location.



Dagon Emerged

Once Dagon is on the Dagon Location (i.e. it emerged onto the seas), Players do not roll the die while traveling to Island Loca-tions since the Travel is always considered “dangerous”. The bottom section of the Skellige Exploration card is read.
ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageTRAVELING TO FIGHT DAGON	Dagon Fight outcome:
As shown on the Dagon card, there are two possible re-sults of the Dagon Fight:

When Dagon has emerged (reached the Dagon Location), the Player may decide to board a Ship on the Continent and sail to Fight it.

1.	Dagon is Driven Away if:
a. The Player manages to win the Fight. a



b.
The Player is defeated but Dagon has only 0 or
1 cards left in the Life Pool. b



Remember: You cannot enter the Dagon Loca-tion until Dagon emerges.



To Fight:

ƒThe Player has to be on a Location on the Continent that has a Ship on it.

In that case, Dagon miniature
is placed on appropriate spot
of the Danger Track which de-     a	b pends on the number of Play-
ers. The Player is rewarded with: c
ƒ2 Gold	c
ƒAny chosen 0-cost card from the pool of the
6 available .	d ƒThe top card from the
Dagon Bonus cards and places it with the Trophies that they have.


The Player do not move up on the Trophy Track and they do not suffer Fatigue. d

2. The Player is completely defeated, if they have 0 cards, and Dagon has 2 or more cards in the Life Pool. e

The Player may only get a Dagon Trail token in one of two ways:

ƒThey fought Dagon and lost.

6. AWild Hunt Movement pool 6 is created. (Skip that Step in a 1-Player game.) Each Player places their Scoring token near the Round Tracking board, creat-ing the Wild Hunt Movement pool. The Closed Tavern token is added to the pool. It is used in Phase IV of each Round (as explained on page 9).

Put all unused tokens back in the box.



7. SETUP CHANGES
Players choose the member of the Wild Hunt 7 that they will fight against. This character is called Wild Hunt for short in this Rulebook and in the other game components.



1.	Players don’t keep track of their Trophies 1 as col-lecting them is not a victory condition.

Important: Players don’t suffer Fatigue after gain-ing a Trophy.
2. Players use Wild Hunt help cards 2 instead of the standard help cards.

Each row also has a “Phase IV” spot 3 , showing what happens at the end of each Round. (New Monster and/or Hound appears, and Wild Hunt Moves.)
At the end of the 8th round 4 (7th round for 4- and 5-Player games), Players fight the Wild Hunt during Phase IV.

Fighting the Wild Hunt is explained at the end of the Rule-book (see page 11); gameplay changes are described next.




Remember: The term “Wild Hunt” – when used in this Rulebook, or on any component – refers to the Wild Hunt member that is being used in this game.

The Wild Hunt appears on the Main Board at the start of the game. They travel and affect different aspects of the game. Players are unable to Fight them until the last Round of the game (which can be the 7th or 8th Round, depending on the number of Players, see page 6).

In the Wild Hunt Expansion, the Goal of the game is to defeat the Wild Hunt during an epic Fight that takes place after the last Round.

Before that, Players complete Quests, fight Hounds of the Wild Hunt, and the usual Monsters.

At the end of the game, Players try to win a Fight against Wild Hunt together, after the last Round. If they manage to kill the Wild Hunt, before all Witchers are Knocked-Out, they win the game together.

If all Players are knocked out in the Final Fight with the Wild Hunt, they all lose the game.


ROUND TRACKING BOARD


Players use the Round Tracking Board and the Tracking token during the game.
During Game setup, the token was placed 1 on the “1” spot (representing the First Round of the Game).
Each row has a “Phase II” spot 2 , showing which Wild Hunt Exploration card is drawn; during the first four Rounds, a Stage I card is drawn; during the final 3 Rounds, a Stage II card is drawn.

WILD HUNT AND HOUNDS STRENGTHEN MONSTERS


The Monsters are affected by the Wild Hunt and/or Hounds that are located on the same or neighboring Location as the Monster.

For each Hound and/or the Wild Hunt on the same or neighboring Location as a Monster, the Monster’s Life Pool is increased by 1.

The Monster’s Life Pool cannot exceed 20.

Phase I



number of Shields. These represent its de-fense that will absorb Damage received in the Final Fight.

Wild Hunt Shield tokens are kept on its card (or beside it).

Some Wild Hunt Exploration/Event cards make the Wild Hunt lose 1 or more Shields. In such a case, put the Shields lost back in the box.

The Wild Hunt may also lose Shields when any Player successfully Fights a Hound (see page 10) or Defeats the Monster (see page 9).

If the Wild Hunt has 0 Shields, any additional Shield loss that it might suffer before the Final Fight is ignored.


TURN SEQUENCE


The Turn sequence in the Wild Hunt Expansion changes in many ways. It’s best to take things slowly at first and get to know gameplay basics in the first few Rounds.

All of the Phases play out differently, and there is an Ad-ditional Phase IV when the Wild Hunt is activated.











Fighting a Hound of the Wild Hunt

When Hounds appear during the game, you can Fight them!

ƒYou can Fight a Hound alone or together with other Witchers, if you all share the same Location with the Hound.

ƒFighting a Hound is considered to be a part of Phase I and does not end Phase I (see page 10).

ƒWhen the Hound Fight is over, each Player on the Location may decide to take the Location Action and continue their Turn, if they are able to.


Exchange Action – two or more Witcher meet

ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageWhen two (or more) Witchers are at the same Location, at any time during Phase I, any of them can perform Ex-change Actions.

Each Witcher (sharing the same Location) may freely exchange (or simply give away) any of the following be-tween themselves, any number of times each: Gold, Po-tions, Bombs (Monster Trail Expansion), Trail tokens, and Trail Quests (that have 1 Gold on them). (Each Witcher still has a 4-Potion and 4-Bomb limit.)

Location Actions – Dice Poker

The only Location Action that is different while playing the Wild Hunt Expansion is Dice Poker. You cannot play Dice Poker against other Players during the Wild Hunt expansion.

The Player choosing to take the Dice Poker Location Ac-tion pays 1 Gold, rolls 5 dice, and they may perform 1 reroll (of any number of dice). Then, the Player compares the result with the table on the “Wild Hunt help card” to gain Gold (possibly 0).

Supporting a Witcher:

Any number of Players sharing a Location with a Player fighting a Monster may choose to Sup-port them.

Players may Support the fighting Player only if they have at least 1 card in their hand.

Decrease the Monster’s Life Pool by the num-ber of cards discarded.

After creating the Life Pool, the Player Fight-ing the Monster draws a number of cards (from their deck) equal to the number of cards that were discarded.

When you Support a Player (by discarding any number of cards), you get the Witcher Trophy from the Player Fighting the Monster.

You may only have 1 Trophy from each other Player.




Phase II

Phase II begins when all Players decide to end Phase I (or they can’t perform any Movements or Actions).

First, all Players who want to, perform a Fight. Players are not allowed to Fight each other.

ƒPlayers resolve their Fights in any order.
ƒIf two (or more) Players are at the same Location, they decide together which one of them actually Fights the Monster (alone).

ƒThe other Player(s) (sharing the same Location) may Support the Player fighting the Monster.
You may Fight any Monster (that you share a Location with) following the standard rules, with some exceptions:

ƒFor each Hound and/or the Wild Hunt on the same or neighboring Location as a Monster, the Monster’s Life Pool is increased by 1.

ƒThe Monster’s Life Pool may not exceed 20 cards.
ƒThe choice for Charge/Bite is done by flipping the Charge/Bite token after the card is revealed.

ƒIf the Monster is Defeated or Driven Away: Do not draw a new Monster (new Monsters only appear as an effect of the Wild Hunt’s activation, see page 9).

ƒThe rewards and consequences of Defeating, Driving Away, or being Defeated are the same as the base game with two exceptions:


ƒYou do not suffer Fatigue if you kill a Monster.
ImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageImageƒIf the Monster is Defeated or Driven Away, the Wild Hunt loses a number of Shields equal to the Level of the Monster.

For example: When Player defeats a Griffin (Level 2), they discard 2 Wild Hunt Shields.

Then, any Player that did not Fight a Monster may Medi-tate; but remember, you do not suffer Fatigue when play-ing the Wild Hunt Expansion.

You can Meditate regardless if you Supported a Fight or not.

After all desired Fights and/or Meditations are done, any Player draws the top Wild Hunt Explo-ration card from the Exploration deck (it may be a stage I or stage II card, as shown on the Round Track).

Exactly one card is read (regard-less of the number of Players in the game).

The entire card is read by any Player.; It may contain a:

Quest (to be completed by one or more Players during the following rounds).

ƒFollow the card’s instructions and keep it face-up near the Main Board. (If you have other active Quests, these remain in play.)


Remember: As with the standard Exploration cards, the used ones should be kept in the game box and shuffled back only after the Players have used all of them once during multiple play ses-sions.


After reading one Wild Hunt Exploration card (and pos-sibly the Event card connected with it) Players move to Phase III.

During the 8th Round (7th round for 4 and 5 Players) no Exploration card is read.

Phase III

Players play Phase III as in a standard game in any order. They may discuss the cards that they wish to get with one another.

After a Player gets a new card, the pool is moved to the right and a new card is drawn.

After each Player has completed Phase III, move to Phase IV.

Phase IV



Choice (to be made collectively by the group of Players).

b. Place the matching Monster card and the Location token in the Monster section of the Game Board.

If there are 3 Monsters present on the Board, and you must draw a 4th, the Monster is not drawn. Instead, add Shields to the Wild Hunt equal to the Level of the Monster that was supposed to appear multiplied by 2.

For example, if Players were supposed to add a Level 2 Monster, and there are 3 Monsters in the game, they add 4 Shields to the Wild Hunt instead.

While playing the Wild Hunt solo, you don’t draw a token from the Pool, but the Wild Hunt always moves 2 Loca-tions towards your Location.

Wild Hunt builds up its power

If the Wild Hunt enters the Lo-cation with 1 (or more) Witchers, the Wild Hunt’s Special Ability is activated.

Players follow the Special Ability description on the Wild Hunt card.

Phase IV End

Move the Tracking token to the next row on the Round Tracking board, and begin the next Round.



FIGHTING HOUNDS


Players that occupy the same Location as a Hound may decide to Fight it together.

This does not count as a “Monster Fight” (as you would perform during Phase II); it’s completed immediately during Phase I.

Players may try to Fight each Hound once during Phase I.








2. Wild Hunt Movement

If there are any Players on the Wild Hunt’s Location, it per-forms no Movement. Proceed to step 3.

Otherwise, one Player takes all the tokens in the Move-ment Pool and randomly draws one of them.
Fight preparation

Based on the information shown on the Hound’s card, according to the Hound’s level, each Player who chooses to Fight does the following:

ƒdraws a number of cards from their deck to their hand, and

ƒlowers their Shield level.

If it is a Player’s Scoring token, the Wild Hunt moves up to 2 Locations towards that Player, using the shortest way. If there are two shortest ways, Players choose one of them together.

The Wild Hunt immediately ends its Movement when:

ƒIt enters a Location with any Player, and/or ƒIt moved 2 Locations.
If it is the Closed Tavern token, the Wild Hunt moves up to 2 Locations towards any Player (chosen collectively by all Players).

Attacks

Each Player fighting the Hound creates a card Combo to try to deal as much Damage as possible. Each Player who chooses to Fight have to play at least 1-card Combo.

ƒDamage symbols deal Damage to the Hound.
ƒShield symbols raise the Player’s Shield level (up to their Defense Level).

ƒAll other symbols are ignored.

If the Wild Hunt has any Shields, Players must remove them first: for each Damage dealt to the Wild Hunt while it has any Shields, reduce its Shields by 1. (Once all Shields are removed, immediately start dealing Damage as normal to the Wild Hunt, with remaining Damage, if any.)

ƒWhen the Wild Hunt performs their Fight Turn, any Player discards the top card from the Wild Hunt’s deck face up; if it’s a:

ƒSpecial Attack card:
ƒEach Player applies the same effect (as shown on the top part of that card).



2. All Players not at the same Location as the Wild Hunt are directly moved to the Wild Hunt’s Location (they do not perform a Fight Turn).
ƒStandard Attack card:
ƒEach Player flips the Charge/Bite token separately and applies the corresponding effect.



3. The Wild Hunt performs a Fight Turn.

4. All Players (that are not knocked-out) take a Fight Turn (in any order).

Repeat steps 3 and 4 until any of the following is true:

ƒThe Wild Hunt is defeated, ƒall Witchers are Knocked-Out.

Player’s Fight Turn

ƒPlayers choose the order in which they perform their Fight Turn.

ƒEach Player must complete their full Fight Turn be-fore the next Player can start their Fight Turn.

ƒDamage dealt to the Wild Hunt always removes Shields first. When the Wild Hunt has no Shields re-maining, the Damage discards cards from the top of their Life Pool deck.

Passive Ability on Special Attack cards

If one or more of the Wild Hunt’s Special Attack cards are discarded during a Player’s Turn (by dealing Dam-age or any Ability), then the “Passive Ability” on each of those cards is activated.

Being Knocked-Out

If a Witcher has 0 cards in their hand and deck, they are Knocked-Out.

ƒThey don’t perform any further Fight Turns, nor apply Wild Hunt Attack effects.

The remaining Witchers continue the Fight.

Winning / Losing

If all Witchers are Knocked-Out, all Players lose the game.

If the Wild Hunt Life Pool deck is empty, and there is at least one Witcher standing, the Fight is over and the Witchers win!

The Witchers that were Knocked-Out during the Final Fight have also done their part; and therefore all Players are considered Winners.

4.	Shuffle the Action Card deck and place it above the Action Card slots. Reveal cards until you have 3 “0-cost” cards, which go in the 3 lowest spaces (face up). Reshuffle any other revealed cards, then reveal 3 more cards for the remaining spaces (face up).

c.	If a mage, place their School and Specialty tokens on the map, covering those of an unused Witcher School. 
d.	Place the 5 cubes and Shield or Energy marker on the lowest (“level 1”) spot of each player board track.

RENOWN: 
HOW TO WIN: 
Set a LIMIT OF 7,8OR9  ROUNDS to determine game length. Use the LARGE HOUNDS CARD to track the Rounds.  
Whoever has the most RENOWN at the end of the final round is the winner.

IN-GAME RENOWN: 
Completing a Quest is worth 2 RENOWN 
A Monster trophy is equal to the MONSTER’S LEVEL + 1 (i.e. Level 1 = 2 RENOWN, Level 2 = 3 RENOWN and Level 3 = 4 RENOWN).  
Meditation Trophies are worth 3 RENOWN. 
Witcher Trophies are worth 3 RENOWN. You may only gain 1 TROPHY from each Witcher. 
Legendary Monster is 5 RENOWN. If the Legendary Monster is defeated, the game ends at the END OF THAT ROUND. 
You may defeat monsters of the same level multiple times to gain the specified RENOWN of that level.

2)	Highest combined attribute level (add up the levels for each of the four attributes) 
3)	Most coins 
4)	First, or highest in turn order in the final round 
CONTRACTS: 
CONTRACT SYSTEM GAMEPLAY 
1.	When the active player enters a location with a NOTICEBOARD MINI, take a LARGE MONSTER card of ANY LEVEL from the bottom of the appropriate pile. Place the LARGE MONSTER card on the main board below the matching terrain of the NOTICEBOARD for all players to see. Remove the NOTICEBOARD MINI and place it above that monster’s card. 
2.	Roll the TERRAIN DIE that matches that noticeboard terrain and place the MONSTER MINI at that Location. Alternatively use this app:   https://swirle13.github.io/The-Witcher-Old-World-Tool/#/locationTokens 
3.	The active player takes the top MONSTER WEAKNESS token from the appropriate terrain pile and places it face-up on their player board. This represents the knowledge they have learned from the contract and is the main benefit from being the player to get a contract from a noticeboard. 
4.	Roll the TERRAIN DIE that matches the TERRAIN TYPE of the monster’s location. Draw and place a random MONSTER WEAKNESS token that matches that TERRAIN. This will represent another weakness for that monster. Any player can gain this weakness token by entering this location. Whenever a monster weakness is gained, IMMEDIATELY PLACE A NEW ONE by rolling the TERRAIN DIE again.  
5.	Once the monster is defeated, all players with matching MONSTER WEAKNESS and TRAIL TOKENS put them back to their respective pile at the bottom of the pile. The winner takes the SMALL MONSTER card and flips it to its Trophy side underneath the board. 
6.	Roll the TERRAIN DIE that matches the TERRAIN TYPE of the defeated monster and place a new noticeboard in that location. 
NOTE: Trail tokens are gained in the same way as usual, so even if a monster with a terrain type isn’t currently on the board (only the noticeboard is), you can still gain a trail token for that monster as you’ve trailed something but aren’t sure what it is yet. 
NEGOTIATING A CONTRACT  
The number of coins for a contract is equal to the MONSTER’S LEVEL + 1. However, you can negotiate more money. The active player and the player to their right each roll 2d6. The player to the right is acting as the person who posted the contract notice. If the active player EQUALS OR EXCEEDS the other players roll, the contract is worth 1 EXTRA COIN and is added beneath the monster. If the active player fails the roll, the contract amount remains the same. 
ROUNDS: 
ONE ROUND IS EQUIVALENT TO EACH PLAYER TAKING 1 FULL TURN IN THE BASE GAME 
PHASE I 
Starting with the player with the first player token, each player may either MOVE, or Pass:  MOVE 
1.	Discard Action Card(s) from your hand to move to connected Location(s). Multiple cards may be played to move to adjacent terrains. 
2.	Take any eligible actions (Location Action, Dice Poker, gain trail, weakness token or Resolve Quest) at the end Location only (i.e. the last terrain card played only).  
3.	End your turn. The turn goes to the next player in clockwise order. 
PASS 
1.	If you no longer wish to move or can't move, you must pass. 
2.	OPTIONAL: Discard an action card from your hand to move to a connected location. You may do this as many times before going to step 3 but do not do the location action. 
3.	Take any destruction tokens that your Witcher is on has ended its turn on. 
4.	IMMEDIATELY proceed to Phase II and Phase III. After you have completed Phase III, the turn goes to the next player in clockwise order. 
PHASE II: 
Chooses whether to EXPLORE, MEDITATE or FIGHT. Then, each player performs the option of their choice as per the base game rules, with the following exceptions:  WITCHER V.WITCHER FIGHT
If a player challenges another player to a WITCHER FIGHT, the challenged player is forced to fight, regardless of if that player has passed or not. 
At the start of a Witcher v Witcher fight, record the number of cards that the defending player has in hand. 
The player who initiated the fight is the attacking player and strikes first. 
After the fight, if the attacking player won, the defending player draws a number of cards equal to the recorded number. If the defending player won, they shuffle and draw that amount +1. 
Only the attacking player may gain a Trophy. You may only gain 1 trophy from each Witcher.  
PHASE III: 
After the player has chosen to completed PHASE II, take the following end of round steps: 
1.	Discard (optional) and draw up to 4 cards. If you've suffered a Complete Defeat to a MONSTER, draw up to 3 cards instead. 
2.	Choose an action card from the market area. Acquired Action cards will go into your hand as per normal rules. 
3.	If this is the last player to complete PHASE III this round, the first player token moves clockwise to the next player, then a new round begins. 
SKELLIGE  
The Dagon can be fought from any Skellige location once it has emerged. The Dagon stays on its Emergence Space until defeated. 
After travelling to Skellige and performing a Skellige event, you may still undertake EXPLORE, MEDITATE, FIGHT during Phase II. 
Siren is the only monster present at the beginning of the game. It is randomly placed on one of the Skellige Isles, but otherwise the original rules are the same. 
LOST MOUNT: 
Regardless of whether the roll for the lost mount was successful or not, roll the d20 for a new location.  
HOUNDS: 
Add the end of every ODD turn, spawn a Hound in level order. (i.e. ROUND 1 – level 1 Hound, ROUNDS 3 & 5 – level 2 Hound, ROUNDS 7 & 9 – level 3 Hound).  
Use the LEGENDARY HUNT movement cards. Use the second number on the legendary hunt movement card for spawning. 
Each EVEN turn, the hounds move towards the second number on the legendary hunt movement card. Hounds always move 1 location. 
Hounds add 1 health to a monster’s life pool if they are in the same, or an adjacent location to the monster being fought (not other hounds). 
After a player moves into a location with a hound, they may fight it during Phase I. This follows the exact rules from Wild Hunt, including rewards. 
LARGE HOUND CARD can be downloaded here: https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/260220/wild-hunt-hounds-large-card-for-use-in-competitive  
LEGENDARY MONSTERS 
When you END YOUR PHASE 1 on a destruction token, IMMEDIATELY take the Destruction Token. You may choose the IMMEDIATE BONUS, or keep it face down to have the initiative when fighting the Legendary Monster. This cannot be flipped later for the immediate bonus. Return flipped destruction tokens to the bag. 
Any ADDITIONAL FACE DOWN Destruction Tokens that you have when facing the LEGENDARY MONSTER will reduce the LM’s life pool prior to the fight.
