## Factions/Playable Characters or Roles

Players don't choose distinct factions, but rather represent families vying for influence within the East India Company. Gameplay differences emerge from the offices players hold and the strategies they pursue (e.g., focusing on trade, military actions, or political influence).

## Additional Notes

- The game has a steep learning curve but offers deep, emergent gameplay.
- Understanding the historical context enhances the experience but isn't necessary to play.
- The solo and two-player modes introduce an AI opponent called "The Crown" with its own decision-making process.

# John Company - Rules
[[John Company.pdf]]
SECOND  EDITION Rules of Play 
In  John  Company,  players  assume  the  roles  of ambitious families  attempting  to use the British East India Company for personal gain. The game begins in the early eighteenth century, when the Company has a weak foothold on  the subcontinent.  Over the course of the game, the Company might grow into the most powerful  and  insidious  corporation  in  the  world  or collapse under the weight of its own ambition. 
John Company tells the story of a state-sponsored trade monopoly.  Unlike  many  economic  games,  players often do not control their own firms.  Instead, they will collectively guide the Company by securing positions of power and attempt to steer the Company's  fate  in ways  that  benefit  their  own  interests.  However,  the Company  is  an  unwieldy  thing.  It  is  difficult  to  do anything alone, and players will often need to negotiate with one another. In John Company, most everything is up for negotiation. 
Ultimately,  this  game  isn't  about  wealth;  it's  about reputation.  Each turn  some of your  family  members may retire from their Company positions, giving them the opportunity to establish estates and compete in the London Season for favorable marriages and powerful political  and  commercial  opportunities.  Critically, players  do  not  have  full  control  over  when  these retirements happen.  Players will often need to borrow money to best capitalize on their good fortune. 
John Company engages very seriously with its theme. It is  meant  as  a  frank  portrait of an  institution  that 
was as dysfunctional as it was influential. Accordingly, the  game  wrestles  with  many  of the  key  themes  of 
imperialism  and  globalization  in  the  eighteenth  and nineteenth  centuries  and  how  those  developments 
.A A. l  . ~.,-··-,··-··:·.. t :  ', ' .  .  were felt domestically. As such, this game might not be suitable for all players.  Please make sure everyone in 
i  ..  your group consents to this exploration before playing.

Components 
THE  BOARD 
John Company's board has four main areas. On the far left there are five prize boxes where players will score the majority of their points. The middle left contains tracks which show the Company's  health and boxes to hold various pieces and cards. The map on the right side displays the political status and potential profitability of India. Lastly, there is a red ribbon which starts in 
the top left and proceeds along the bottom edge of 
the map, ending  in the Bay of Bengal. This ribbon 
charts the course of play through the game's phases 
and the operations of the different company offices. 
RULEBOOKS  AND AIDS 
There  are  two  main  rulebooks:  this  one  and  the 
Crown Handbook which is used for the solo and two-player play. The game also includes two large player aids and two small player aid cards. 
PLAYER PIECES 
Each of the game's six families has several game pieces, including 18 family members,  1  victory point  marker,  6  promise  cards,  1  glass opportunity marker, a family board, 2 firm cubes and 4 firm strategy cards. 
A player's family members are their most important resource and will be used in the game to mark many things, including their control of various company positions, their shares in the Company, and the vast estates they have purchased. 
INDIA  PIECES 
John  Company  uses  several  different  types  of pieces  to  track  the political fortunes of India. There are 20  tower levels and 8 domes, one for each region. There are 3 sets of metal flags, which are used to track the size of the empires which might emerge on the subcontinent. Events are resolved using a set of 20 event tiles. There are 8 control/ loot  tokens  used  to  track which  regions  have  been  looted  by  the Company and the Presidency associated with them. Finally, there is a resin Elephant used to indicate a looming political Crisis. 
WOODEN  PAWNS  AND CUBES 
There are 6 pawns in three colors which are used as markers to indicate 
the  status of various  tracks.  Red pawns  mark Company  Standing, 
Balance, and Debt. Black pawns mark the game turn and votes. The silver pawn can be used to keep track of the current phase. There are 30 wooden cubes. The orange cubes  are used to mark fatigue when placed on office cards and unrest when placed on Company-controlled  regions. The red Crown promise cubes are used in the solo and two-player game. 
MONEY  SUPPLY  ~ The game includes coins in the following denominations and quantities: £1 (40), \"~) 
£2 (20), £5 (20), and £10 (10). The bank is unlimited, but these coins should cover almost every circumstance. 
CROWN  AI  CARDS  AND  BOARD 
There are 10 Crown AI cards and a Crown board which are used in the solo and 2  two-player games. 

ENTERPRISES  (SMALL CARDS) 
There are 57  small enterprises in the three enterprise types: 22  shipyards  (shipping),  20  workshops  (manufacturing), and 15 luxuries (social). Shipyards, workshops, and luxuries generally share the same points of card anatomy, described to the right. 
GENERAL  ANATOMY 
Cost  Enterprise Type Inc~ome  otes Image
@  "i 

OFFICE  CARDS  Image
There are 17 office cards used to track which player controls which  office. If an office is vacant, its office card is placed facedown on  
the Vacant Offices box on the board. Some offices are not in play  at the start of the game and should be placed nearby.  
PRESTIGE  AND  BLACKMAIL CARDS  
Prestige cards (20)  and blackmail cards (10)  are usually won in the London Season and grant special bonuses. Prestige cards with an icon in the top right also count as enterprises. Many of these cards have special powers which are described in text on the card. 
LAW CARDS  Image
Law cards (26) are used by the Prime Minister player during the Parliament Meets phase. These cards can change the fundamental rules of the game or present challenges which the players must all face together. If a law is passed, 
it is placed faceup near the board and the remainder are kept in a stack near the  Prime Minister.  One  law card, the Deregulation card  (with Debtor's Prison on back), is used only in certain scenarios. 
COMPANY  FAILURE  CARDS 
John  Company ends either with the success of the Company or its  failure.  ImageWhen the Company is successful, players will compete in one final retirement,  
where  they  may  score  additional  points.  If the  Company  fails,  a  random  Company failure card (6) is drawn to determine whom the fickle public will  
blame for this disaster. Most failure cards inflict some sort of scoring penalty.  
SETUP  CARDS  AND  SCENARIO  CARDS  'O ImageImageImage
John Company has several scenarios which are described on 3 scenario cards. Players use the matching set of setup cards (18 each) to create their starting positions. 
SHIPS 
There are  22  player-owned ships. These ships are placed on shipyards when  Imageunfitted and then placed on the map or on firms when fitted. If fatigued, they  
are  turned  to  their fatigued  side.  There are  also 14 other ships  used by the  Company. On one side, they are extra ships, which are under short-term leases  and will only trade for a single turn before returning to the supply. On the other  side, they are Company ships that are built and maintained by the Company. Image
PRIME  MINISTER 
One player will always be the Prime Minister and keeps the Prime Minister dial in their play area.  The  Prime  Minister's  arm is  used to indicate the proposed policy that will be enacted if the current law passes. 
REGIMENTS  AND  LOCAL ALLIANCES 
There  are  20  regiments  and  7  local  alliance  pieces  which strengthen Company armies. 
CLOSED/FILLED  ORDERS 
There  are  17  pieces  used  to  mark  closed  orders  m  India  and  those  filled  by the Company or firms. 
POWER TOKENS 
There are 4 power tokens that track the power status of the 3 different enterprise 
types and of Company shares. These are placed on the Power track and will shift 
in position depending mostly on the passage of certain policies. 
OFFICE  OVERLAYS  (0 TChoemrep aanrey -8 codniftfreorlelnetd G. Tohvee rfnaomr iolyv emrleamysb, ewrh siecrhv ainreg  aads dGedo vtoer tnhoer  misa pp liafc a edre ognio nto bpe coofm thees   OW O
overlay. In addition, there is one Superintendent of Trade in China overlay used to hold  ~ both the family  member in that position and any ships assigned to Trade in China. 
There is also one Governor General overlay which is placed on the ribbon if that office 
is in play. 
OTHER  PIECES,  MARKERS  AND  DICE 
There are 6 dividers, used to show writer affiliation. There is  a Chairman marker and an Opposition Leader marker which are given to the player(s) with that office or title. There's a Company share victory point token used in some scenarios. There are also 18  trophy/passed law pieces.  Finally, there are 10 standard dice, and 1 storm die. 
Setup 

1.	Place the game board and component trays in the center of the table. 
2.	Shuffle the India event tiles and place them next to the board. 
3.	Place the local alliance tiles in the Army boxes where they are listed. 
4.	Place a marker on the "5" space of the Company Balance track located on the bottom edge of the board. 
5.	Place the four power tokens on their indicated spaces on the Power track. 
6.	Every player should take a set of player pieces. Place each family's victory point marker on the "o" space of the Victory Point track (top left of the board). 
7.	Place the tower levels, domes, and flags near the right side of the board. 
8.	Place the laws, office, prestige, blackmail, and setup cards nearby. 
9.	Next, choose a scenario. 
4 
⦁	The 1710 Scenario should be played first. 
⦁	The 1758 Scenario is recommended for those who have played the 1710 scenario a couple times.  Here,  the Company  begins with its monopoly, but this can be broken, opening the gates of India to private firms. 
⦁	The  1813  Scenario  is  the  most  advanced scenario. In it, the Company starts without its monopoly, and players may start private trading firms. This scenario is best with 5 or 6 players. 
⦁	The  Long  1710  Scenario  is  intended  for players who have the time to play through the full historyofthe Company. This scenario begins identically to the 1710  scenario, but it gives  players  the  tools  of Deregulation. This scenario may go up to 8 turns and often takes twice as long as the other scenarios. 
After choosing a scenario, take the matching scenario setup card. Follow any instructions on the front of the card, taking components as needed and using pawns to mark the listed position on various tracks. Then, set up  the  regions of India as  shown on  the card. Place a black pawn on the space with the matching date on the Turn track, and  the arm on the  Prime Minister dial to point to the matching date.

Next, take the player setup cards matching the date of the chosen scenario. If playing with 5 players, add 3 of that scenario's extra cards. If playing with 6 players, add  6. 
Shuffle these cards together. 
Next, deal out the setup cards evenly among the players. Each player should take everything listed on their setup cards.  For each office  listed, place a  family  member on the listed office space and take the matching office card. For  cash  listed,  take  that  amount  from  the  bank.  The remaining icons are explained on the right. 
Then, complete setup: 
10.	Set any remaining office cards near the board. 
11.	Build  the  London  Season  Display.  Shuffle  the prestige cards  and  blackmail cards  together and deal three. Prestige cards should be placed faceup, blackmail cards should be placed facedown. 
12.	Shuffle  the  remaining law cards  and place them near the board. 
DRAFT VARIANT 
Instead of drawing random setup cards, players may wish to draft starting positions using the following procedure. After setup cards are dealt, each player selects one and then passes the remainder to the player to their left. Continue doing this until no cards remain.

Concepts and Key Terms 
COMPONENT  LIMITS  AND  INFINITE  TRACKS 
Most components in John Company are limited by the pieces included. If a supply of pieces is empty, complete as much of the action as possible. However, players may use proxies if they run out of cash, trophy/passed law tokens, dice, and regiments. The Company Balance, Victory Point, and Vote tracks have no limit. 
YOUR  PLAY AREA AND  HIDDEN  INFORMATION 
Players  maintain  a  play area  that  contains  everything they own. All  information (including the contents ef discard piles) is public except facedown blackmail cards. 
CASH  FLOW 
In John  Company, cash always  has  a location, and its  location determines how it can be spent, traded, or paid. You can spend cash in your family treasury on various family actions, retirements, upkeep, taxes, and negotiations. Cash within a Company office can only be spent by that office. 
Some Company positions will reward players with extra income during their actions. ImageIn the rules, these payments are highlighted by boxes like this one. Image
THE  PRESIDENCIES 
The British East India Company divided India into three administrative zones called Presidencies which are each named after their home region. In John Company, these Presidencies are special offices that maintain their own Army, cadre of writers, fleet of ships, and-later in the game-subordinate  offices. These resources are stored in their marked boxes or in the zone of the Indian Ocean near their office box on the map. 
THE  MAP  OF INDIA AND How  TO READ  IT 
Though much of the action of John Company occurs outside of India, players will frequently refer to and use the map oflndia. If you are learning the game for the first 
time, you may wish to skim this section and return to it as needed. 
The map  is  divided into eight regions, each roughly corresponding to  a  different political and commercial trade center. Each region has a number of qualities: 
iJF Every region has  strength, usually represented by its  tower.  The number 
of levels in the tower dictates the strength of the region (the dome does not count as a tower levd). This number is used to determine a region's attack and defense value. 
iJF Within each region are a number of connected circles called orders. Each 
order  contains  a  number  that  indicates  the  value  of that  order  and  is connected to other orders with a dotted line.  Orders  represent economic opportunities for the players. 
⦁	Home Ports. Orders with a heavy black outline are called home ports. Players use these orders to access other orders deeper in India. 
⦁	Closed  Orders. If an order is  closed,  cover it with a  closed order token. This represents trade disruptions or anti-Company sentiment. 
iJF Every  region  has  a  political  alignment:  either  sovereign  or  dominated. Sovereign regions (those with a large flag or a dome without any flag) will attempt to invade their neighbors. Dominated regions  (those with a small 
6  flag or no dome) will attempt to rebel to regain their sovereignty. 
EMPIRES 
When a region conquers another region, it either forms an empire or expands its existing empire. All empires are composed of one capital region (marked by a flag with a star) and at least one dominated region (marked by a smaller version of that  of their regions when attacking

THE  LOOMING  CRISIS  (THE  ELEPHANT) 
India is always faced with a looming Crisis. This is represented by the Elephant and its position and direction on the map. The Elephant is always in play. 
It indicates one of two types of Crisis: 
r,r Impending  Invasions.  When  the  Elephant  is  placed  on  a  border 
between two regions,  the acting region  (with the Elephant's  tail)  is getting ready to invade the region the Elephant faces. 
r,r Impending Rebellions. If the Elephant is in the center of a region or 
facing the region that dominates it, the acting region is getting ready to rebel against its sovereign. 
Invasions and Rebellions are described in detail in the Events in India phase.

Negotiation 
John Company is a negotiation game. Players can transfer a wide range of assets to one another. This includes: enterprises, facedown blackmail cards, cash in your family's treasury, shares, and promise cards. You cannot transfer officeholders, writers, officers, pieces on prizes, spouses, passed laws, played blackmail cards, Prime Minister dial, or trophies. 
Promise Cards 
Each player has  a  set of five  promise cards  they may give other players as  part of a negotiation. You may "call in" a promise card and force the player who guaranteed the promise to fulfill the promise if they can. Critically, you cannot "call in" a promise card once the game is over and players are resolving Final Scoring. If multiple players call in a promise at the same time, the player who guaranteed them chooses which to fulfill if they cannot fulfill all of them. All promise cards contain details of their use on their Imageback sides. 
When transferring resources there is one golden rule: something transferred  cannot  activate  twice.  For  instance,  during  the 
Bonuses phase, Cati collects £1Jor her workshop's prqfits. if she sells  Imageher workshop at this time to another player,  it will not generate £1  
again this round.  
Negotiations involving immediate transfers are binding. All other negotiations are non-binding. 
Further transferring details are described here: 
wr Enterprises and Blackmail Cards. You may 
trade any enterprise card. You may allow others to peek at your facedown blackmail cards 
and trade them, but they cannot be 
traded faceup. Remember to adjust 
the victory point total if traniferring 
luxuries. 
wr Family Cash. You may freely 
transfer money from your family's treasury to the treasuries of other families. 
wr Shares. When 
exchanging these 
pieces, the player 
gaining the piece should 
return the previous owner's 
piece to their supply and place 
a family member from their supply in its place. You may 
not transfer the Chairman. 
wr Promise Cards. You may 
trade promise cards with any player, including returning them to their guarantor or giving them to a third party. 
Game End 
Each scenario of John Company concludes at  the  end  of  the  turn  indicated  by the  scenario.  The  game  can  also  end immediately  if  the  Company  Standing marker ever moves to the leftmost space on the Standing track. 
Once  the  game  is  over,  players  may not negotiate,  cash  in  promises,  or  play blackmail cards (unless a card's text explicitly allows it). Then players perform  the  Final Scoring phase. 
FINAL  SCORING 
Final scoring has several steps which are described 
0 in  the  list  below.  Any  ties  after  Final  Scoring 
are broken in  favor of the player with the most 
window icons and then in Prime Minister order 
(clockwise, starting with the Prime Minister).  Victory Point

Power Award. Each player totals their power. Power comes from these sources:

r,r Trophies. Each trophy token in your play area is worth +1 power. 
The players with the most and second most power gain victory points depending on which turn was the final game turn, as indicated by the table on the board. If 
players are tied for the most power, award the lower value to the tied players only, and no other power award is given. Players tied for second place get nothing. 
2.  Score Court and Workshops. If the Company survived, each Company share is worth the number of victory points indicated on the Court. If the Company failed, players lower their score by that number instead for each, and players score 1  for each workshop they own. Scores may drop below zero.

Sequence of Play 
John Company is a procedural game played over a set number of game turns. Each game turn consists of phases performed in the following order: 
I.	The London Season. Officeholders retire and compete for prestige cards. 
II.	Family. Players invest in the Company and increase their holdings. Then new Company shares may be created. 
III.	Hiring. The Company fills all vacant positions. 
IV.	Company Operation. Each Company office operates following the red ribbon from left to right on the game board. 
V.	Bonuses. Players take bonus income. 
VI.	Revenue. The Company pays its expenses, the Chairman may pay dividends, and the Company adjusts its Standing. 
VII.	Events in India. Storms and events in India are resolved. 
VIII.  Parliament Meets. Parliament meets to vote on a law. 
IX.  Upkeep  and  Refresh.  Players  pay  upkeep  on  their  pnzes  and prepare for the next game turn. 
'"The Political-Banditti Assailing the Savior of India" (1786) by James Gillray. Gillray's earlier cartoons regarding Warren Hastings, the Governor General 
ef India, cast him in a heroic light. Here he is assaulted by Charles 
J ames Fox, Edmund Burke, and Frederick North, portrayed as highway robbers. However, as the Impeachment trial wore on, Gillray would 
revise his attitude (see page 21). 

I.	The London Season 
The London Season has three steps: Attrition, Retirements, and Prestige Cards. This phase is skipped on the game's first turn. 
ATTRITION 
This step should be completed simultaneously by all players. 
Roll one die for each office card you hold. Each fatigue on a card adds +1 to the 
result of that office's die roll. The result determines what happens: 
wr 1 or 2: Nothing happens.  Image
wr 3 or 4: Add a fatigue to the office card.  wr 5 or more: That officeholder retires. Move the family member holding  Fatigue 
that office to the Pensioners box on the board. Then, flip the office card  (and Unrest) Cube 
to its vacant side and place it in the Vacant Offices box nearby. Any 
fatigue that was on the office card should be returned to the supply. 
⦁	The Stress of Being Chairman. When rolling for the Chairman, add 
+1  to the result. 
RETIREMENTS 
Starting with the Chairman  (or former Chairman if the office is vacant) and going clockwise, each player may retire their pensioner(s). For each pensioner, choose a prize on the left side of the board, pay the cost indicated on the top left of the prize box, and move your pensioner to that box. Increase your victory point marker by the amount listed. 
Note: most prizes also have an upkeep value listed to the right ef their cost which must be  Imagepaid during the Upkeep and Refresh phase. In addition, many prizes also have window  tax icons, which may need to be paidf or during the Parliament Meets phase.  
Window Tax Instead of paying the cost of your retirements directly to the bank, set it near  Icon 
your player area. It will be used to determine turn order in the next step and 
should be paid to the bank at the end of the London Season.

PRESTIGE  CARDS 
Beginning with the player who spent the most total cash on retirements this turn, each player who retired at least one pensioner this turn must take or discard one card from the London Season Display. Any ties are broken in favor of most total window icons (including.from retirements this turn!) and then in Prime Minister order (clockwise, starting with the Prime Minister). 
When choosing their card, the acting player is welcome to peek at any blackmail card in the London Season Display. 
If there are no cards remaining in the display, all remaining players are skipped. 
Then, discard any remaining cards and refill the London Season Display to three cards. Place blackmail cards facedown. Place regular prestige cards faceup. Note: 
this is done even if there were no cards taken this turn! 
Lastly, return any family members in the Pensioners box to their supplies. 
Prestige and Blackmail Cards in Detail 
The different types of prestige and blackmail cards are described below: wr Spouses  usually increase your  family's  victory points,  but  most 
come with a restriction you must follow for the rest of the game. 
Spouses  cannot be  transferred.  If a  restriction  requires  you  to discard  or  trade  enterprises/shares,  players  must  negotiate  any trades  immediately after they  take  the  spouse.  Regarding Violet Effingham,  any  fitted  ships  connected  to  returned  shipyards will still remain in play, but their attached shipyards may not be 
purchased during the Family Action phase if the ship is in play. 
Most spouses also have a retirement discount that lowers the cost of a  retirement  by  the  amount  shown.  These  discounts  can  be stacked, but may only be used by you alone. Each discount may be used once per London Season and once per Final Scoring. Note: these discounts will lower the amount you spend in retirement,  which can influence the order in which prestige cards are taken. 
wr Enterprises on prestige cards offer special powers which a player 
may  use.  These  enterprises  may  be  worth  power  during  Final Scoring like other enterprises of their type and are likewise affected by policies during the Parliament Meets phase. These enterprises can be transferred. 
wr Blackmails offer one-time effects. After they are used they are placed 
in your player area faceup and cannot be transferred. At the end of the game, all blackmail cards in a player's area (faceup or down) count for power during Final Scoring. 
Image LONDON DISPLAY IN ACTION  l Image
Next, players perform the Prestige Cards step. This step goes in order of the player who spent the 
most money during the Retirement step. Blue spent £8 and Yellow spent £4, and so Blue will go first. 
First, Blue peeks at the blackmail card, but decides  Lon<lon~casonU,sp!ay Imageto take Lord Highgate. No replacement is drawn. 
Yellow peeks at the blackmail card and decides to pick it. 
Finally, the remaining card is discarded and three 
12  new cards are placed in the London Season Display.  Image

II.	Family 
This phase has two steps. First, all players will take their family action. Then, new Company shares may be created. 
FAMILY ACTION 
Starting with the player with the Chairman title and proceeding clockwise, each player selects one family action from those listed in this section. Each player should 
place their opportunity marker on the action they choose. (Note: at the start ef the game, this marker is not on any action.) 
If a player's opportunity marker was already on the action they chose at the start of this phase, they may take that action twice instead. Example: your opportunity marker is on the purchase shipyard action. This turn you could take that action twice. Ify ou take a * dijferent action, you will only take it once. 
Extra Actions.  Some  laws  enable players  to  take an  additional action after they have taken their main action. Only the most recently-passed extra action can be used. This action does  not benefit from a player's opportunity marker, nor does a player move their opportunity marker to the space corresponding to the extra action. 
Out of Family Pieces? If you need to place a family piece during this phase but have none, you may choose to take one from any prize. If taken from a prize, lower your victory point marker by the printed value of that prize. Image
Enlist Writer Image
Place one family member in one of the three regional Writers boxes. If there are four or more vacant offices, you may place an additional writer once this tum. This might allow you to place two or three writers in a turn depending on the location efyour opportunity marker. 
Enlist Officer Image
Place one family member in the Officers-in-Training box. Purchase Luxury 
Pay £4 to the bank and take one luxury. Each luxury gives you Q victory  ImageImage
points as long as they are in your possession. Adjust your victory point  
marker to reflect your purchase. Each luxury has a window tax icon,  
which may need to be paid for during  the  Parliament Meets phase.  Window Tax Each luxury counts as a social enterprise.  Icon 
Purchase Shipyard Image
Pay £2 to the bank and take one shipyard. Place the matching ship token on the shipyard in the space indicated. Shipyards provide a £1 bonus each turn if their ship has been fitted and provide a single vote in the Parliament Meets phase. Each shipyard counts as a shipping enterprise. 
Purchase Workshop Image
Pay £5 to the bank and take one workshop. A workshop provides a £1 bonus each turn and two votes in the  Parliament Meets phase. If the Company 
fails, it is worth 1 victory point during Final Scoring. Each workshop counts as a manufacturing enterprise. 

Seek Share 
Place a family member on an empty space on the Stock Exchange track Imageand pay the price printed on that space to the bank. These family members may become shares at the end of the Family phase. Once shares, they may provide income through dividends and will be worth victory points at the end of the game if the Company survives. If the Company fails, they will 
cost victory points instead. 
NEW  COMPANY  SHARES 
Once all players have completed their turn, check to see if any family members on the Stock Exchange track are added to  the Court. One will be added for each Company Debt as described below. 
If the Company has  Debt, move the rightmost family member on the Stock Exchange into the Court box and lower the Company Debt marker by one. 
A family member in the Court is called a Company share. If Company Debt remains, repeat this step again. 
Finally, if there are still pieces in the Stock Exchange track but no Company Debt, slide rightward all remaining family members on the Stock Exchange as far as possible, preserving their order. 
III.	Hiring 
In this phase, all vacant offices in the Company are filled through hiring. 
GENERAL  HIRING  PROCEDURE 
Offices are hired in ascending order using the number on the back of each office card. Vacant offices can only be hired by certain officeholders who choose from a specific pool of candidates. The hiring office and the available candidates are listed on the back of the office card. Once a candidate is hired, move that family member to the new office and give that player the matching office card. 
⦁	Nepotism. You may select your own family member to hire, but you must  have  the verbal  consent of every other  player in  that  office's candidate pool. This does not apply to electing the Chairman. 
⦁	Promotions.  Some higher offices  (1,ike the Director ef Trade)  are  hired from  family  members who  already  hold  offices.  Whenever a  family member  is  promoted  in  this  way,  their  previously  held  office  card 
should be flipped over and added to the stack of vacant offices in the appropriate order (ascending). Any fatigue tokens on the promoted officeholder's previous card are moved over to the new office card. 
No  Candidates  or Hirer?  In  some circumstances  there  may be  no  eligible candidates for an office. When this happens the office is skipped in the hiring process and will remain vacant through the turn, taking no actions (including 
hiring others). If the office responsible for hiring a candidate is  vacant, that office is skipped. Image

· ► 
Each office is hired in a different manner described below. 
CHAIRMAN 
Any player with a Company share may attempt to become the new Chairman. To be elected the new Chairman you need consent from players that control a majority of the current Company shares. 
At the start of the election, the former Chairman should declare the number of Company shares required to achieve a pure majority (more than half of total). Then, any player is  welcome  to campaign  for  their candidacy. As  soon as  a candidate has the required number of supporting Company shares, the election is over, and that player is chosen as the new Chairman. 
The newly-elected Chairman takes the Chairman marker and moves one of their Company shares to the Chairman slot on the board. This piece still counts as a Company share, but cannot be traded in a negotiation or used for firm investments (if playing with Deregulation). 
If no candidate can receive the necessary support, the former Chairman picks any player with at least one Company  share to  become  the  new Chairman, including themselves. This choice is not subject to the Nepotism rule. 
An Empty Court? In some scenarios it is possible for the Court to be empty. In this case the former Chairman will automatically become the next Chairman, and should place a family member from their supply to the Chairman slot. 
CHAIRMAN  ELECTION  ImageImage
There are 5 shares in the Court of Directors box. In  Court ef Directors order to become Chairman, a player with a share  Image
in the Court requires the support of a majority of  
shares. In this case, 3 shares will do the trick.  
If no one can get the support, Blue, as the former  Chairman, will choose anyone in the Court. For this  reason Yellow and Pink decide to work together. Yellow  would like to be the Chairman and offers Pink £1 and  
a promise card if Pink will throw their support behind  Yellow. Pink consents and Yellow is elected Chairman.  

The rest ef hiring is mostly a straighiforward affair. Players learning the game shouldf eel free to read this hiring example and then skip the remainder ef this section. 
GENERAL  HIRING  ImageImage
The Chairman (Pink) must hire the Director of Trade and can choose any other officeholder except a Governor to fill the job. Here are the current candidates: 
Image   ImageImageImage
Pink would like to promote Military Affairs to the office, but can only Imagedo so if they can secure the consent of both Yellow and Blue thanks to the Nepotism rule. Yellow and Blue decide to withhold consent. 
Yellow offers £1 to Pink for the promotion. Blue matches the offer and then includes the promise card "Consent to Nepotism." This would allow Pink to ignore Blue when checking for Nepotism later. Pink agrees and promotes the Manager of Shipping. 
First, Blue moves their officeholder family member to the Director of Trade spot and takes the Director of Trade's office card. The fatigue on the Shipping office is moved over to the new office card. Then, place the Shipping office card in the Vacant Offices stack.

DIRECTOR  OF TRADE 
The Chairman hires  from any current officeholder except the Chairman or a Governor. If all offices are vacant, any writer can be chosen. Note: Commanders 
are not qfficeholders. 
MANAGER  OF SHIPPING 
The Chairman hires any writer for this position. 
MILITARY AFFAIRS 
The Chairman hires any Commander in a Presidential Army for this position. If there are none, they may hire any officer, or, if none, any piece in the Officers· in-Training box. 
PRESIDENTS 
The Director of Trade hires any writer or Governor associated with that region's Presidency for this position. 
GOVERNORS 
The President associated with the Governorship hires from any writer or officer in the region. The family member holding this position should be placed on top of the corresponding Governor overlay. Note: a Commander is not an qfficer and cannot be promoted to a Governor. 
If there is a Governor General, these positions no longer exist (page 26).

Vacant Offices. Sometimes offices will remain vacant if there were no eligible candidates to hire or if the hiring office was vacant.  In this 
⦁	case, the office is skipped. 
No Dead Actions. A player cannot take an action that would have no effect or chance of success e.g. trading without having a ship to fill an order or deploying without a dice to trigger potential qfficer losses. 
SUCCESS  CHECKS 
Doing business in India is  risky.  Most actions that concern India require the acting player to make a check to see if their actions are successful. Each check requires a roll of the dice. The number of dice you roll is  dependent on the resources you have and want to spend as determined by the action. Any money spent comes from the office's treasury and is paid to the bank. 
When making a check, first,  decide on the amount of resources you want to spend  or exhaust,  and gather  the appropriate  number  of dice equal  to  the amount shown on the office card. 
Then, remove dice equal to the penalty.  Finally, roll the dice. Use the lowest rolled value to determine one of three results. 
⦁	1 or Q  is a success. 
⦁	3 or 4 is  a  failure. The check may be attempted again if there are sufficient resources. 
⦁	5 or 6 is a catastrophic failure. The office will take no further actions. The acting officeholder is immediately returned to its player's supply, and that office card is flipped and placed in the Vacant Offices box. Any fatigue that was on the office card should be returned to the supply. 
Note: some qffices will use the result ef a check in other ways, as detailed in their rules.

CHAIRMAN Image
The Chairman may first  increase Company Debt and then must allocate the Company Balance. 
You  may  advance  the  Company  Debt  marker  up  to  three  times.  For each advance, increase the Company Balance by £5. If you wish to advance the Debt marker additional times, you must have the consent of players who control a majority of Company shares for each additional advancement (Remember: the Chairman counts as a share for this purpose!). The Chairman may not advance the debt beyond the end of the track. 
Then,  allocate all funds  on  the  Company  Balance  track to  any other office treasuries. Reduce the marker on the Company Balance track by the amount transferred and add it to the respective office treasuries. Note: a Chairman may wish to increase Debt as they allocate to make it easier to plan. As long as they follow the rules for taking debt described in the previous paragraph, this is fine.

DIRECTOR  OF TRADE Image
The Director of Trade may take the Special Envoy action and then may move writers and ships between the Presidencies. The Special Envoy action can be taken multiple times. 
Special Envoy 
Make a check. Each £1 you spend gives you one die. There is no penalty. If you are successful, choose one of the following: 
r,r Open trade with China. Create the Superintendent of Trade in 
China by placing the office overlay to the right of the board near the Bengal Presidency and taking its office card from the stack of unused offices. The office should be hired immediately. 
r,r Open an Order. Open one closed order in any region in India 
that is not controlled by the Company. 
Then, you may make up to two transfers. In each, move one writer or ship from one Presidency or sea zone to any other. Image

MANAGER  OF SHIPPING Image
The Manager of Shipping fits, buys, and leases ships on behalf of the Company. You must spend funds in your treasury until it has at most £2 remaining. Funds 
can be spent to: 
i1F Fit Ships on Shipyards. Pay £3 to the bank to take a ship from a shipyard 
and place it in any of the three sea zones. Note: this does not require the shipyard owner's consent. 
iJF Buy Company Ships. If there are no ships on shipyards, pay £5 to the 
bank and place a Company ship from the general supply in a sea zone. iJF Lease Extra Ships. Pay £2 to the bank to place an extra ship from the 
general supply in a sea zone. Extra ships are ships on short-term leases 
that will be returned to the supply during the Refresh step. 
MILITARY AFFAIRS 

Military Affairs moves officers and regiments between  Armies,  assigns  new  officers,  and Imageassigns Commanders. 
First, you may makeup to two Army transfers. In each, move one officer or regiment from one Army to any other Army.  Moved pieces always  remam  m  the top  half of the Army box. 
Then,  you  must  assign  each  piece  in  the Officers-in-Training box to any of the three Armies.  New officers  are placed in  the top half of their Army box. 
Finally,  for  each Army,  if there  is  a  player with  more  total  pieces  than  the  current Commander player or if the Commander slot is vacant, assign a new Commander. Choose a  player  from  among  those  having  the greatest number of total pieces in that Army. Move one of their officers to the Commander slot, putting any previous Commander there back into the top half of the Army box as an officer. 
ASSIGING  COMMANDERS 
Military Affairs (Blue)  Imagehas finished transfers  and assigning officers  and will now appoint  Commanders.  
The Army of Bombay is  skipped, as no player has  more pieces here than the  current Commander.  
The Army of Madras  has no Commander, so  Military Affairs chooses  between Blue and  Yellow and picks Blue.  
The Commander of the  Army of Bengal no longer  has the most pieces, so a  new Commander will be  appointed. Military Affairs  opts to appoint their  
own officer, and Pink's  Commander reverts to an  officer. Because this isn't  hiring, Blue disregards  
the Nepotism rule.  Image

PRESIDENCY  OPERATIONS Image
Each President generates revenue for the Company with the Trade action and decides the order in which they, their Commander, and their Governor(s) act. 
Commanders and Governors are not required to take any actions but they must be given  the opportunity  to  act.  Each position must finish  all of its  actions before the next one may begin (players may flip  their family members facedown after to track which have acted). The Trade action can be taken anytime during a Presi* dency's operations so long as it does not interrupt another position. 
Vacant President. If a President is vacant, the Chairman will decide the order of the Commander and Governor(s). A Chairman acting in this  way cannot approve  local alliance purchases or take  the Trade action. 
Trade 
You may fill open orders in India using the Trade action, starting from your Presidency's home port and continuing through any open orders you fill. The Trade action may be taken before or after the Commander or each Governor. The procedure for trading is as follows: 
1.	Declare the regions in which you wish to trade. You must include your home region and cannot include regions that you could not trade in because you do not have enough ships or because you could not fill an order because a connecting order is closed. 
2.	Make a check. Each £1 you spend gives you one die. Subtract one for each region outside of your home region that you declared in step 1 from your total dice. 
Reminder: as  with any check,  if it is unsuccesiful, you may attempt it again during your Presidency Operations so long as you have sufficient resources for 
another check and the check did not end in catastrophic failure. 
If successful, place one writer on an open, empty order space for each ship in this  Presidency's  sea zone. You must place as  many writers as possible, but can only place them in the declared regions. The first writer must be placed on the Presidency's home port (marked with a thick black line). After that order is  filled, additional writers must be adjacent to a writer you already placed. For each order filled, increase the Company Balance by the amount listed on the order. 
⦁	Out of Writers? If all writers have been placed and ships remain to fill additional orders, place filled order tokens ( on the reverse 
of the closed order token) on the orders to show they have been filled. 
⦁	Home Region Privileges. A President may not fill  an order in another President's home region (even if that President is vacant). 
⦁	One Trade. Each President may only successfully trade at most once per game turn. 
Then, you take £1 from the bank for each order you filled. ImageImage
Finally, each player takes £1 from the bank for each of their writers you 20  placed on an order.  Image

The Association of Writers: If a writer is ever placed on an order adjacent to a writer from a different Presidency, place a Presidency divider on the connection so that the affiliation of writers is kept separate during the Refresh step. ImageImage
TRADING  ImageImage
The President of Madras wants to trade  
in Madras, Mysore, and Hyderabad. They  
spend £6 for six dice but must subtract  
two dice because they are trading with two  regions that are not their home region.

Local Alliances.  Local  alliances  are  temporary  Army  pieces.  Their strength can be used for two purposes: the Deploy action and to defend against threats in India during the Events in India phase. Each piece can only be used once on the turn they are purchased, and its strength cannot be split among more than one purpose. 
Then you may take the Deploy action as many times as you wish and can afford. 
Deploy 
The procedure for deploying is as follows: 
1.	Select a target. You may select your President's home region, any region associated with your Presidency, or any region that shares a border with a region associated with your Presidency. You cannot target another President's home region. Remember: you cannot take actions that would have no effect ijyou were succesiful and therefore you cannot declare a Company-controlled region unless it has at least one closed order or one unrest. 
2.	Make a check. Each officer or regiment you exhaust gives you one die. In addition, each local alliance in your Army you exhaust will give you the number of dice indicated on the piece. To exhaust an officer, regiment, or local alliance, move it to the bottom half of its respective Army box. Subtract the strength of the region from your total number of dice. If the region is part of an empire, also subtract the strength of every region associated with it. Remember: 
as with any check, if it is unsuccesiful, you may attempt it again so long as it did not end in catastrophic failure and you have sufficient resources. 
Als-o, note that regions that are Company-controlled never reduce your dice as they have a strength ef zero when defending. 
3.	Check for  losses.  Each player must roll a die for each of their officers that were exhausted in this action (never regiments!).  For each 6 rolled, they must return one of their officers to their supply. 
DEPLOYING  ImageImage
The Commander of Madras is taking the Deploy  action. Their options are Madras (Company  controlled), Hyderabad, and Mysore.  
Though Madras has a closed order which a  Image
Deploy action could open, the Commander  
is looking to make a profit. Mysore would  
generate £9 loot with 3 strength (since it is part  Ny  
ofan empire based in Bombay). Hyderabad  
would generate £15 loot with 2 strength.

If successful, perform the following steps: 
1.	Divide Loot. Gather cash from the bank based on the target region: ImageImageEach Tower Level  Loot Modifier (if faceup) 
⦁	+£4  +£4 to +£9 
Loot  Minimum.  If there  is  less  cash  than  the  number  of officers +  1  (that were used in this action and that survived), increase it by the difference from the bank. 
Distribute this cash among those that participated and survived the Deploy action. First, give yourself £1 (the Commander's share) and £1 for each of your officers. Then continue clockwise to the next player and give them £1 for each of their officers. Continue clockwise in this fashion until all players with officers have been paid or no further cash remains. After paying players, if cash remains, give £1 to the 
bank for each regiment and local alliance (regardless ef strength). If cash remains, continue distributing as described, starting with your 
Commander's share and officers.  Image
DIVIDING  LOOT Image
When it comes to dividing loot, Hyderabad  In the first round, Pink takes £2 (one for an

everyone is paid again. After the second round, Image£3 remains, so payouts continue for a third round, and Pink takes £2 and Yellow £1.

If the Deploy action is a catastrophic failure, first return half (rounding up)  of your trophies to the supply and  return  the Commander  to your supply. 

The remaining qffices in this section are created through player actions over the course efthe game. When they are created, add their qffice card to the Vacant Offices box. 
GOVERNORS 
Governors are created through the Deploy action. 
Governors take a series of Administer actions using a diminishing dice pool. First, take dice equal to the number listed on the office card. Then you may take an Administer action. 
Administer 
Make a check using the number of dice remaining in the pool. There is no penalty. 
If successful, take £1 then choose one of the three following options. If the previous roll was not a success, take an additional £1. 
r,r Build  Company  Ship.  Building  a  ship  occurs  over  two  successful 
actions. If there is no Company ship in your region, place one there. If there is already a Company ship in your region, move that ship to the sea zone associated with your President. Note: a ship in a region represents a ship that is partially built and has no other effect. 
r,r Commission Regiment. Place a regiment from the supply in the Army 
associated with your President. Regiments are treated as officers, but any loot they earn is  paid to the bank and they cannot be removed through a loss check. 
r,r Tax. Add £2  from the bank to either the Company Balance or your 
President's treasury. You may not split this  amount.  Each time you choose this  after your first  time  this  turn,  add one unrest to  the region. 
If the check did not succeed, add an unrest to the region. 
Then lower the number of dice in the pool by 1 regardless of its result. You may continue taking actions until one the following happens: you roll a catastrophic failure, you run out of dice, or you decide to stop. Image

SUPERINTENDENT  OF TRADE  IN CHINA 
This office is created either if the Director of Trade's Special Envoy to China is successful or if Parliament passes the "Envoy to China" law. When created, the office is hired immediately by the Chairman who may promote any writer. 
Unlike a President's treasury, the Superintendent's treasury only contains ships. Ships can be sent here by the Manager of Shipping or the Director of Trade as if it were a sea zone. These ships count as if they were in the Eastern sea zone for storms, expenses, events, and laws. 
This office acts after the Presidency of Bengal operates. 
Trade in China 
To  trade in China,  make a  check.  Roll one die  for  each  ship  in your  Imageoffice's treasury. This check may only be attempted once and cannot be  attempted if there are no opium icons in Company-controlled regions.  
If successful, increase the Company Balance by £4 for each opium icon  Imagein all Company-controlled regions. Then, you take £1 from the bank for  Opium Icon each opium icon in all Company-controlled regions. Image

GOVERNOR  GENERAL 
The Governor General is  created by passing a law of the same name. When passed, all Governors immediately become pensioners. Remove any Governor overlays on the map and any partially-built Company ships. No new Governors are created (or overlays placed) when additional regions become Company controlled. Note: the printed Company icons on the board show players which regions are Company-controlled when the Governor General is in play. 
The  player  holding  the  Director of Trade  card  should  replace  it  with  the Governor General card and place the Governor General overlay on the ribbon. Any fatigue on the Director of Trade office card should be moved to the new office card.  Return all Governor cards and the Director of Trade card to the box. 
The Governor General is hired like the Director of Trade by the Chairman and is subject to attrition like any other office. 
The Governor General hires Presidents and performs all of its actions during the part of the Company Operation phase formerly used by the Director of Trade office. The Director of Trade's treasury is now used by the Governor General. From now on, if any regions are lost via attacks on the Company, follow the Region Loss rules but skip the Governor Elimination step. 
When acting, first increase the Company Balance by £3 for each region that is Company-controlled. 
Then the Governor General may attempt  the Govern  action any number of times. 
Govern 
The procedure for governing is as follows: 
1.	Make a check. Each £1 you spend gives you one die. There is no penalty. 
2.	For each 6 rolled, place one unrest in each Company-controlled reg10n. 
If you are successful, take £1 for each region that is Company-controlled. Then,  for each region that  is  Company-controlled, choose one of the 
following (note: you must choose an option!): 
wr Governor General's  Shipbuilding.  Place  a  Company  ship  in 
any sea zone (including China). 
wr Governor General's Commission Regiment. Place a regiment 
from the supply in any Army. 
wr Governor General's Tax. Either increase the Company Balance 
by £2 or place £2 in any Company treasury except your own. Then place an unrest in a  Company-controlled region.  If you make this choice multiple times in a single turn, you must place the unrest in a different region for each. 
If the check did not succeed, place 1 unrest in each Company-controlled region. 
⦁	One  Govern.  The  Governor  General  may  only  successfully 
26  govern at most once per game turn. 
V.	Bonuses 
During this phase, players collect bonuses. Every player should take £1 for each shipyard with a fitted ship and each workshop they own. 
VI.	Revenue 
During the Revenue phase, the Company will pay expenses, check expectations, and then pay dividends. 
During  this  phase,  the  Company's  Standing  will  often  be  adjusted.  If the Standing marker is  moved to the leftmost position of the Standing track, the Company has failed. Go to the Final Scoring immediately (page g). 
EXPENSES 
First, lower the Company Balance marker by £1 for each debt as indicated by the Company Debt track, each regiment and officer in an Army ( do not include Commanders), and each ship in the three sea zones. 
⦁	Emergency Loans. If the Company cannot pay its expenses, emergency loans must be taken to cover those expenses. For each emergency loan taken,  move the Company Debt marker one space to the right and 
add £5 to the Company Balance track. If the Company Debt marker is already on the rightmost space, you still take out emergency loans but do not advance the Company Debt marker further. Do this until all  expenses  have  been  met.  Emergency loan  advancements  of the Company Debt marker do not incur expenses during this game turn. Finally, set the Company Balance to zero. 
⦁	Public Embarrassment. Lower the Company's Standing one space to the left if one or two emergency loans were taken this turn.  Lower it two spaces if three or more emergency loans were taken this turn. 
CHECK  EXPECTATIONS 
Next,  lower the Company's  Standing one  space  to  the  left if the Company Balance  is  less  than  the  Expectations  value  listed  beneath  the  Company's Standing. 
PAY DIVIDENDS 
Finally, the Chairman may pay out dividends. 
The cost of each dividend is equal to the number of Company shares. When a dividend is  paid, lower the Balance by an amount equal to the number of Company  shares.  Each  player  takes  £1  for  each  of their  Company  shares. Multiple dividends may be paid. Remember: the Chairman counts as a Company share for dividends. 
⦁	Public Enthusiasm. Advance Standing one space to the right if more total cash was paid in dividends than Expectations. 
27 

VII.	Events in India 
During  this  phase,  roll  the  storm  die,  resolve  any  storms  and  then  resolve  a number of events in India during which the political and economic landscape of India will shift and Company-controlled regions may face Rebellion. 
THE  STORM  DIE 
Roll the storm die. The resulting face indicates which ships are subject to storms and how many events occur in India. 
⦁	Storms. If one of the three sea zones is rolled, roll a die for each ship in that sea zone except Company and Extra ships. If the die face with three storms is rolled, you must check for all sea zones. 
On a 1 or 2, nothing happens to the ship. On a 3 or 4, flip the ship to its fatigued side. If the ship is already fatigued, the ship is sunk and should 
be returned to its shipyard. On a 5 or 6, the ship is sunk and returned to its shipyard. When a ship is returned to a shipyard, it should be flipped to its non-fatigued side. 
⦁	Events in India. After resolving any storms, resolve as  many events in India as  indicated by the number on the storm die.  For each event in India, flip one tile from the draw stack. These events will often open or close orders, alter a region's strength, and may lead to Cascades. The location of the event often depends on the back of the top tile in the India draw stack. 
FLIPPING AN EVENT  ImageImage
⦁	 ImageCIOACn  onhcmrnOII open ordeT.  Image
If all an, clOM:d, perform Cucadi:  (closcorden!i n connecu:d"'gion1).  
Image
The newly drawn event tile is Turmoil. This will occur in the region of Maratha as this card is now the top tile of the draw stack. 
WRITER  Loss 
When resolving events, orders sometimes become closed. If a writer is on such an order, the writer is returned to its owner's supply. If the order 
has a filled order token, flip it instead. 
CASCADE 
If you are ever required to close an order but all orders in that region are already closed, a Cascade occurs. Close all open orders connected to the orders in that region. When doing this, if a connected order is already closed, close the northernmost open order in that region instead. If every order in that region is already closed, trigger an additional Cascade. 
Each region can only Cascade once during the resolution of each event tile. However, a region may receive the effects of more than one Cascade per tile.  In other words, while a region might be "flooded" by closed orders from more than one region, it can only "overflow" once. 
REGION  Loss 
Attacks  against the Company  can trigger the  loss  of a  Company-controlled region. When this occurs, follow these steps: 
1.	Tarnish  the  Commander's  Name.  The  Commander  of  the  Army associated with this region returns half (rounding up) of the trophies their family owns to the supply e.g.  a player with 3 trophies would lose 2. Return the Commander to its supply. 
2.	Officer Rout. Roll a die for every officer in the Army and remove it if the roll is a 6. 
3.	Governor Elimination. If this region has a Governor, return it to the unused offices stack and return the officeholder's family member to that player's supply. Any fatigue on the office card is returned to the supply. 
4.	Restore Local Authority. Remove the Governor overlay, any Company ship, and any unrest in the region, and place a dome back in the region with one tower level (place the appropriate flag if this region fell as part of a successful Invasion Crisis). Place the region's control token back in its region with the loot side facedown (zt will not generate additional loot in thefature). Close every open order in the region. If all are already closed, resolve a Cascade. 
5.	Company Humiliation. Lower the Company's Standing by one to the left for each region lost this turn (including this region). E.g. The.first lost region lowers Standing by 1 space,  the second lowers Standing an additional 2 
spaces, etc. This can cause Company failure. If this happens the game is over. Finish the Events in India phase, then resolve Final Scoring. 
REGION  LOSS EXAMPLE  ImageImageImage
The event is a Crisis with a strength modifier of +3. The Elephant is pointing at Bengal,  which is currently Company-controlled, so the Crisis is an Attack on the Company (all ef the  
different Crisis events are described in detail on pages 32-33). The total strength of the attack is 8  (3 for the event tile, 2 for the attacker's region, and 3 for the 3 unrest cubes. The Commander  
of Bengal's Army has 2 officers, 2 regiments, and the J agat Seths. They have a collective  strength of 6, and cannot mount a successful defense. The Commander (Pink) exhausts the  
entire Army and the region is then lost. A new empire is born with Maratha as capital.  
The Commander then loses half (round  Imageup) of their trophies. They have 3 trophies,  so they must lose 2. The Commander is  then returned to their family's supply.  
Next, each player rolls a die for each officer  Co<  '  
in the Army associated with the region.  . ......  
Pink rolls 1 die and Yellow rolls 1. Yellow  ......... £2  cl  ,,  
rolls a 6 and must lose an officer.  _ .......  
Next, the region is cleaned up and restored to local  Imageauthority. The Governor and its office card are returned to  their supply. The Governor overlay and unrest is added to  the supply. The region's control token is returned to the  region. Note: a region only generates its loot bonus once!  
⦁	·  Image
Finally, every order in  e region is then closed and a 
dome with one level is placed in the region. Finally, the 
Company lowers its Standing. This is the first region 
loss this turn so the Company's Standing is lowered by 
one. Note: as this was an Attack on the Company, additional 
attacks will occur if there are other regions with unrest.  29 

ELEPHANT'S  MARCH 
After  resolving  some  events,  the  Elephant  will  move.  First,  check  for  Imperial Ambi* tions. Otherwise, it will move to the region pictured on the top of the draw stack. 
Imperial Ambitions. After resolving a successful Invasion Crisis, the Elephant will always be moved to the successful capital's region, regardless of which tile is on top of the draw stack. 
After moving the Elephant, determine its position using the following procedure: 
r,r If the region is Company-controlled, put the  ELEPHANT'S  MARCH ImageImage
Elephant in the center of the region. 
r,r If  the  region  is  currently  dominated  by 
another  region,  place  the  Elephant  on  the 
border facing its current sovereign to indicate 
a looming Rebellion. 
r,r If the region is sovereign, place the Elephant

indicate  a  looming  Invasion.  The  Elephant Image
should be  facing towards  the  region on  the 
other side of  border. If the Elephant faces 
a  region  that  already  dominated  by  the Image
region on the  of the draw stack, use the  Imagefirst clockwise region from  
Fully-Formed  Empires.  In  the  rare  instance  that  all  neighbors  are  dominated,  place  the  Elephant  on  the border matching the shape on the  Elephant  redirect  arrow  and  position  it so that it is pointing at the empire's  capital.

EVENTS  DESCRIBED 
All of the events in India are described in the following sections. 
Turmoil Image
Close the northernmost open order in the region pictured on the top of the draw stack. Any writer on the order is returned to that player's supply. 
If all orders in this region are already closed, perform a Cascade. 
Windfall 
Players take £1 from the bank for each writer they have on an order in the region pictured on the top of the draw stack and all adjacent regions i.e. regions that share a border with that region. 
Shuffle Image
First, perform the Elephant's  March. Then, shuffle this tile in with the remainder of the draw stack. Finally, shuffle the discards and place them on top of the draw stack, facedown. In the rare instance the draw stack is empty, perform the Elephant's March last. 
Leader Image
If the region pictured on the top of the draw stack is  sovereign, add a tower level to it. Otherwise, treat this event as a Rebellion in the pictured region with a strength modifier equal to the number on the explosion symbol (see Crisis rules). 
⦁	Elephant Redirect. If the Elephant was fully within a Company controlled  region  that  successfully  rebelled,  perform  an 
Elephant's March. (Otherwise this event does not move the Elephant.) 
Peace Image
Open  any orders that are connected through  the border  the Elephant stands on. Then add one tower level to each region touching the Elephant 
that is not controlled by the Company. If the Elephant was wholly within a region (indicating a potential Rebellion), open all orders in that region 
and  remove  any unrest  in  this  region.  Then,  perform the Elephant's March. 
PEACE  EXAMPLE ImageImage
The newly-drawn event tile is Peace. This event  Imageoccurs in the location of the Elephant which is on  
the border of Mysore and Madras. The order in  Madras is now opened and Mysore will have its tower  increased from 2 to 3 levels. Note: the other order in  Madras remains closed and it does not remove the unrest  cube as the Elephant was notfally within Madras.  
Lastly, the Elephant Marches to Mysore and will point to  Hyderabad across the border marked with the triangle.  Image
Crisis 
Like Peace, the location of the Crisis is determined by the placement of Imagethe Elephant piece, not by the top tile of the draw stack. The Elephant's tail (where it is walking.from) indicates the attacker. The Elephant's head (where it is walking to)  indicates the defender. After resolving a Crisis, perform the Elephant's March. 
INVASION 
If the attacker is  a sovereign region, resolve an Invasion. Determine whether the attacker's strength (including the strength ef any other regions 
in its empire) plus the modifier listed on the event tile is greater than the defender's  strength (including the strength ef any other regions in its empire). If so, the Invasion is successful; otherwise, the Invasion fails. 
If the Invasion succeeded, remove any flag on the defending region's dome and place a flag matching the attacker. 
* 
Shattered Empire. If the defending region was a capital, any 
⦁	flags matching its empire are returned to the supply. 
New Empire. If the attacker was successful and does not have a flag, place any flag with a star still in the supply on their dome. 
If none remain, a new empire cannot be formed and no flag is added to the attacker or defender. 
If the Invasion failed, remove one tower level from the attacker. 
REBELLION 
If  the  attacker  is  a  dominated  region,  resolve  a  Rebellion.  In  a Rebellion, the Crisis is only between a dominated region and the region that dominates it (other regions in the empire have no impact!). Determine whether the attacker's strength plus the modifier listed on the event 
tile  is  greater  than  the  defender's  strength.  If so,  the  Rebellion  is successful; otherwise it fails. 
When a Rebellion is successful the attacking region is now sovereign. Return  its  flag  to  the  supply.  Then,  close every open order in the attacking region. If all are already closed, resolve a Cascade. 
If the Rebellion failed, remove one tower level from the capital. Image

ATTACKS  AGAINST  THE  COMPANY 
Both Invasions and  Rebellions against Company-controlled regions  are resolved  the  same  way.  Whenever  attacked  by  any  type  of Crisis,  the Company must resolve the Crisis (called the primary Crisis) and then must resolve an additional Rebellion Crisis in each other region with unrest cubes using the following rules: 
ur Order of Resolution. Always resolve the primary Crisis first. Then, 
starting with theCommanderoftheArmyofBombay  and proceeding downwards, each Commander resolves attacks in regions associated with their Presidency in any order. 
⦁	Vacant  Commander.  If the  Commander  is  vacant,  Military Affairs will act in its stead (choosing which pieces to exhaust etc.) If 
that office is also vacant, the Chairman will choose. The player acting as Commander will not lose or gain trophies. 
ur Attack Strength. In the primary Crisis, calculate strength depending 
on the Crisis type (Invasion or Rebellion). In addition, add one to the strength for every unrest in this  region.  In other regions, the strength of each Rebellion is equal to the number of unrest in that reg10n. 
ur Mounting Defense.  The  Commander  associated with  the  region 
must exhaust pieces in the Army equal to the strength of the Crisis or as many as possible. If the newly-exhausted pieces do not equal 
the strength of the Crisis, the Crisis succeeds. Perform the steps of Region Loss (page 29). 
If the attack failed, remove all unrest in the attacked region and the Commander associated with the region should take a trophy token. 
⦁	Failed  and  Successful  Invasions.  If the  primary  Crisis  was  an Invasion  that  failed,  remove  one  tower  level  from  the  attacking 
region if possible. If it was  successful  follow  the rules of empire creation and growth as described on the previous page. 
Foreign Invasion 
Roll the storm die and resolve an Invasion Crisis and/or Attack against the Company in each region linked to a storm (Bombay for West Indian, Madrasf or 
South Indian, and Bengalf or East Indian). If all storms are rolled, resolve this event once in each. If no storms are rolled, resolve this event in the region on the top card of the draw stack instead. 
For each event, roll a die. Treat this like an Invasion with strength equal to the roll. In addition to those rules, if the Foreign Invasion is successful: 
ur Close every open order in the region. If all orders are already closed, 
perform a Cascade. 
ur Return any flag on this region's dome to the supply. If it was a capital, 
return all flags of that color to the supply. If Company-controlled, return its dome to the board. In any case, set the region's strength 
to half the strength of the Invasion (round down). 
⦁	Elephant Redirect. If the Elephant was  fully within a Company controlled region that was invaded, perform an Elephant's  March 
using•  for the shape. (Otherwise this event does not move the Elephant.) 

VIII. Parliament Meets 
The player with the Prime Minister dial must select a law and bring it up for a vote. They do this by drawing and revealing, one at a time, up to three cards from the law deck and selecting one. The remainder are discarded. Players are welcome to discuss each law before the next is drawn. However, if a dilemma (indicated at the top of the card) is drawn, the Prime Minister must stop drawing and select that law. 
After selecting the law, the Prime Minister must select a policy by rotating the dial's arm either clockwise or counter-clockwise. The Prime Minister must stop at the first space that matches the icon printed on the bottom of the law card. 
Each space on the Policy track has two elements, a policy consequence and a target. If the law passes, the selected policy consequence will affect the target 
(either an enterprise type, Company share or a prize as indicated by the space's color and icon). 
There are three policy consequences: 
r,r Tax. Each player must pay £1 to the bank for each target they own. For 
each they cannot pay for,  the target should be returned to its supply Image
(this  includes the Chairman!).  Any  fitted  ships  connected  to  returned shipyards  remain  in play,  but  their attached  shipyards  may  not  be 
tak* en during the Family Action phase if the ship is in play. 
Window Tax. Some tax policy spaces have a window icon. If Image
a law passes and a policy space with this icon is selected, all 
players must pay cash equal to the number of window icons 
associated with each of their family members on a prize and 
each of their enterprises. If they cannot, the enterprise or

Next, the Prime Minister reads the text of the law aloud and marks its starting support (printed on bottom right ef law) using the Votes marker on its track. The 
Prime Minister should allow some time for debate before proceeding to voting.

VOTING 
Starting with the Prime Minister, players take turns voting. After a player has voted, the next player in clockwise order votes. After all players have had a chance to vote, the Prime Minister can decide to initiate an additional round of voting or to stop and resolve the vote. Ifno votes were cast in the round, the vote must be resolved. 
A player's votes come from several sources. Each £1 they spend from their family  Imagetreasury is worth 1 vote. In addition, any card in their play area is worth votes  equal to the number of vote icons on the card. When casting these votes, rotate  the card to indicate it has been used. It will be rotated back after the vote is resolved.  
Vote Icon 
As players vote, adjust the Votes marker one space for each vote cast. Players may advance or lower the marker. There is no limit to the number of votes that can be cast. If the Votes marker would advance beyond the end of either side of the track, place cash from the bank near its position to track additional votes. If it would be moved in the opposite direction, subtract any cash before moving it in that direction. 
The Opposition 
Any player who votes against the law is part of the opposition. Once a player votes against a law, they may not vote in favor of it later during that vote. All members of the opposition should count how many votes they have cast against this law using any method (for instance, they could 
group all if their cards used to vote plus any money spent). 
A player who previously voted for the law may change their mind and join the opposition with later votes. 
⦁	The Opposition Leader. The player who has cast the most votes against the law is  the Opposition  Leader and should take the Opposition Leader marker. If there is a tie, the previous holder will continue to hold it. 
⦁	Coalitions in Opposition. Players may cast votes on behalf of another player with that player's consent. This player must have voted against the law or commit to doing so. These votes should be added to their total when determining the Opposition Leader. 
⦁	The Prime Minister's Honor. The Prime Minister cannot vote against  the  current  law or consent  to  their enterprises  being used to vote for that purpose. However, their enterprises may be used to vote against a law if their "Vote with my enterprises ... " promise is used. 
RESOLVING  THE VOTE 
When voting stops, the law passes or fails depending on the position of the Votes marker. There are two possible outcomes: 
wr If the law has -1 support or less, it fails.  Discard the law, resolving any "If 
Failed" effects  if it is  a dilemma. Then, the player with the Opposition Leader token returns it to the supply and takes the Prime Minister wheel. Finally, the new Prime Minister moves the selected policy to either adjacent space on the Policy track and then resolves its effect. 
wr Otherwise, the law passes. Place the law near the board next to the other 
passed laws. The Prime Minister should take a passed law token into their play area. Then, resolve the policy consequence in the space selected and then any immediate effects of the law. 
Final* ly, return any cards used for votes to their regular orientation. 
Legislated Company Failure. If a  law causes the Company to  fail,  the game is over. Finish resolving the vote then perform Final Scoring. 
THE  VOTE  TO  DEREGULATE 
In the 1758 and long 1710 scenarios, the Prime Minister may initiate a special session of Parliament at the start of the turn before the London Season phase. To do this, the Company Standing marker and/or Company Debt marker must be on a lined space. If at least one of these markers is on one of the spaces marked with a star, the 
Prime Minister must initiate a special session to vote on Deregulation. 
If the vote passes, lower Company Debt one space for every two Debt and place the Standing marker on the space marked "S." The Prime Minister gains a passed law token. Refer to the Deregulation rules for additional changes. 
If the law fails, increase the value of Company shares by placing ( or flipping) the VP overlay in the Court. Shares cannot be worth more than +/-3 victory points. 
Unlike other proposed laws,  this  law is  not associated with a policy and the Prime Minister does not change hands if it fails nor will this law be discarded. The Prime Minister may also vote against the law. 
IX. Upkeep and Refresh 
Everyone must pay for their family members on prizes. Each is paid for individually, using the indicated amount on that prize (printed to the right ef the prize's cost). If a 
player cannot pay for a prize's expense, instead return the family member to its supply and lower their owner's victory point marker by that prize's value. 
Remember, players can tranifer .fends to each other at any time. if you're having trouble meeting your expenses, see if other players might be willing to loan you some money. 
Players now prepare the board for the next turn. If it is the final turn of the game, skip this step and proceed to Final Scoring (page g). 
wr Return writers to their associated Presidency. 
wr Return filled order tokens and Presidency dividers to the supply. 
wr Return all extra ships to the supply. 
wr Any exhausted  officers  and  regiments  become  active.  Any active  local 
alliances are exhausted. 
36  wr Then, advance the turn marker and proceed with the first phase. 
The next section is only used when players are playing games with Deregulation. 
Deregulation 
These  rules  are  in play  during  the  1813 scenario.  In  addition,  they  may  be triggered  if players  vote  to  deregulate  the  Company  during  the  long  1710 scenario or the 1758 scenario. 
FIRMS 
Players may now own shares in and manage firms.  Firms can trade in India independently of the Company and provide shareholders with alternate ways to score victory points. 
The Two Firm Treasuries 
Each firm  has  two treasury boxes:  the London treasury and  the India treasury. 
⦁	London Treasury. The London treasury is used to pay expenses and fit  new ships. Any cash raised from investments is  placed in this treasury. Note: players may not tranifer cash in their family treasury to or from.firm treasuries! 
⦁	India Treasury. The India treasury holds revenue gained from trade  in  India.  This  treasury  is  used  to  pay  dividends  and expenses.  Any  remainder  is  then  transferred  to  the  London treasury. 
Dissolving a Firm 
If all shareholders consent, a firm  may be dissolved following the firm dissolution rules described later (page 41). 
Special Retirement 
During the London Season phase, each player with at least one firm share may take one additional retirement using a piece from their supply instead of a  pensioner.  The total amount  of money spent  for  this  retirement cannot exceed the value of the highest total dividend paid out by a firm in which they own a share. This retirement is otherwise like any 
other retirement a player can make with a pensioner. Note: even if a player owns shares in multiple.firms, only one special retirement can be taken! 
Furthermore, note that discounts on spouses can be used to retire on prizes with 
a value higher than the dividend paid by a.firm. 
⦁	Disreputable Firms. A firm that has not yet placed its dividend cube or that has its dividend cube on the zero space may not be used for any special retirement. 
Firms in Final Scoring 
At the start of Final Scoring, players will score or lose the number of victory  points  indicated  by  the  firm's  value  for  each  firm share they own or each family piece they have in Debtor's Prison. After totaling victory points earned, any remaining fractions are 
rounded down. 
Then, regardless of Company success or failure,  shareholders may 
perform one special retirement before proceeding with the rest of 
Final Scoring. Note: as this is not a London Season phase,  no cards are 
taken.from the London Season Display.  3 7 
THE  FIRMS  PHASE 
After the Family phase is complete and before the Hiring phase, players will now perform the Firms phase. The Firms phase has two steps: Firm Investments and Firm Strategy. 
FIRM  INVESTMENTS 
The  first  step of the  Firms  phase has  no  set order and players can take the following actions at any time during it. The Firms phase ends when no player wishes to take further actions. Any timing conflicts related to a firm are resolved by the firm's manager. Any timing conflicts between firms  are resolved by the Prime Minister. 
Two of the actions described in this section use Company shares. These rules are restri* cted by the two caveats described below: 
Weak  Company  Shares.  If  the  Company  Standing  and/or  Debt marker is on a lined space, you may not use Company shares to form 
⦁	a firm or invest. 
Immature  Company Shares.  You  may not  invest with  a  Company share that was created this turn. You may not avoid this rule by trading your share to another player. (Players may find it helpful to flip over any newly-created Company shares until the end ef the Firms phase to show that 
they cannot be invested.) 
Forming a Firm 
A player who does not currently manage a firm may form one by returning one of their Company shares to its supply or flipping one workshop to its invested side. Flip your family board over to its firm charter side. Place one family member from your supply on the firm's Shares box to represent the firm's first share. Place one of your cubes on the leftmost space of the Value track (the other will be used to record the total dividends paid). Add £5 from the bank to this firm's London treasury. Your family is now considered a firm and you are the firm manager. 
Court and Workshop Investment 
With the consent of the firm's manager, players may invest in a firm. For each investment, add £5 from the bank to this firm's London treasury and place a family member on the firm's Shares box. A family member in a firm's Shares box is called a firm share. Reminder: like Company shares,firm shares can be traded by players. 
To invest, a player must first either return one of their Company shares to its supply or flip one of their workshops to its invested side. 
* 
Invested Workshops. An invested workshop is not scored if the 
⦁	Company fails and no longer generates a bonus. 
Firm Share Limit. Firms may only have 10  shares. A firm with 10 shares may still be invested in, but will not create any further shares. 
38 
Acquiring Ships as a Firm 
A firm manager may spend cash from the firm's London treasury to the bank to fit  ships on  shipyards which are placed on the firm's  charter. Each costs £3. Unlike the Company, a firm manager may only fit ships with the consent of shipyard owner. 
⦁	Player-owned Company Ship Buyback. A firm  manager may buy  any player-owned  ship  in the Company  with its  owner's consent  by  spending  cash  from  the  firm's  London  treasury. An unfatigued ship costs £3 and a fatigued ship costs £2. Any money spent should be added to the Shipping office's treasury. 
Note: unlike the Company,firms may not acquire Company ships or extra ships. 
Hostile Takeovers 
If you  do  not  manage  a  firm  and  have  the  consent  of players  who collectively hold a majority of a firm's  shares, you may initiate a hostile takeover.  Flip your board to its  firm charter side.  Place your two firm cubes on the tracks in the matching spaces as  the firm you are taking over.  Move  any  ships,  treasury funds,  and  shares  to your board.  The previous owner then returns their cubes to their supply and returns their firm charter to the family side. 
Mergers 
Firm managers may consolidate any number of firms  into a single firm through a negotiated merger. 
In  a  merger, the highest value firm  among  those merging will  be the primary firm  (if there is  a tie,  the players will pick from among those tied). This firm will remain after the merger is completed. The other firms in the merger are called secondary firms. 
As part of a merger, players may negotiate for the transfer of firm shares to other players. If the primary firm would have more than ten shares 
after merger, any excess shares must be returned to their owner's supply with their owner's consent. 
In order for a negotiated merger to take place, all involved firms must have the full consent of every shareholder. All merger negotiations are considered a single immediate transfer (and therefore binding). 
n After a merger is agreed to, all secondary firms  (1_ " .. 
transfer  and  consolidate  their  treasuries, shareholders, and ships into a single fir 
Then,  the  second 
firms flip to their 
family side. 
39 
FIRM  STRATEGY 
After the Firm Investments step, all firm managers must simultaneously and secretly decide their trading sea zone and how much money to spend trading. 
First, each firm manager secretly selects which sea zone and home port they intend to use in trade and how much cash from  their firm's  London treasury they will spend in the attempt. They indicate this by placing the matching firm strategy card facedown near their player board and placing the money they wish to spend on the matching box of the firm board. A firm may select a sea zone as long as they have at least one ship, even if the associated home port is closed. 
Firm managers that do not wish to trade may select the "Hobnob"  strategy.  No cash may be placed on this strategy. A firm with this strategy will not trade or pay dividends (zt must still pay expenses!), but it will allow a firm  to keep its previous dividend marker for the purposes of special retirements. 
Players should cover any money allocated to their strategy with their hands or by any method they agree upon. Once all players have made their decisions, players reveal  the amount  they  have  spent,  however their strategy card should  remain facedown. Note:firms only get a single trade attempt each turn, so make sure you allocate enough! 
FILLING  ORDERS  AS A FIRM 
At the start of a Presidency's Operations (before any actions are taken), any firm with a strategy that is associated with that Presidency reveals their strategy and make a check with dice equal to the cash allocated to their strategy. The cash is then paid 
to the bank. If at least one success is  rolled, the firm  may trade. Each firm  that successfully trades has an initiative value equal to the total of their ships minus the number of successful dice (Is and 2s) they rolled. This number can be negative. 
Orders are filled  after the  President has  made a  successful roll while taking the ships*  in tVhaecira nPtr ePsrideesnidceyn'sc yse oar z Foaniel.u re to Trade. If the President is vaancda ncto ourn tdso aelsl  
Trade action. A President's roll determines their initiative like a firm 
not trade (for any reason), ties in initiative are decided by the Chairman marker.  Firms with strategies associated with this  Presidency fill  orders after its Commander or Governors have had a chance to act. 
Players then fill orders starting with the firm or Company with the lowest initiative and proceeding to the highest. When it is their turn, the President or firm manager trading in the associated Presidency fills  as  many orders as possible. Any ties in initiative are decided by the operating President. 
Firms fill a number of open orders up to the number of ships they own plus one. Orders must be filled starting with the home port listed on their strategy. When filling an order, you must be able to trace a path back to this port through any number of orders that you have filled.

Previously-Filled Orders. Firms may fill orders previously filled this turn by other firms or the Company. The Company may fill orders previously filled by firms this turn. The filling of a previously-filled order will generate half of its listed value, rounding down. 
Finally, advance your firm's Value marker one space for each £6 you added to the 40  firm's India treasury this turn.

FIRM  EXPENSES  AND  DIVIDENDS 
At the start of the Revenue phase, before the Company pays expenses, firms will pay expenses and dividends in initiative order followed by all other firms with any ties broken by their Manager's windows and then clockwise starting with the Prime Minister. 
Firm Expenses and Dissolution 
Each firm must pay for the following expenses: 
r,r Pay £1 for each ship on the firm's charter. 
r,r Pay £1 for each share in the firm's Share box or pay£ equal to the firm value, 
whichever is higher. 
Expenses can be paid from a firm's London and/or India treasury. 
If a firm  cannot pay expenses it must be dissolved.  Move each share piece to the Debtor's Prison box on the Deregulation card (pieces here lower a player's score by one victory point). All ships owned by the firm are returned to their matching shipyard. The manager of the firm then flips  their firm's  charter back to the family  side. Note: any 
workshops invested in the.firm will remain on their invested side for the rest ef the game! 
⦁	Emergency Investments. A firm  facing dissolution may receive investments 
from any player and use that money to cover expenses following the Court and Workshops Investment rules (page 38). Any cash remaining after expenses are 
paid is lost. Finally, lower the firm's value by 1 space per emergency investment received. Note: if a.firm has 10 shares, it is still possible to invest in a.firm, but no new 
⦁	shares are generated. 
Emergency Mergers. A firm facing dissolution may participate in a negotiated merger with one other firm at this time. As part of the merger, the other firm 
must first pay their own expenses (if it hasn't already done so), and pay any outstanding expenses owed by the firm facing dissolution.  41 

Firm Dividends 
The manager may choose to pay out a number of dividends using cash in the firm's India treasury. For each dividend, £1 for each share is paid to the player owning that share and £1 is given to the player who is the manager of the firm. All cash from dividends is only taken from the India treasury. 
⦁	Optional  Dividends.  Unlike  Company  dividends,  any shareholder may elect to not be paid for any number of their 
shares on any dividend,  so  long as  the manager consents. For example, a.firm has the following shareholders Blue (2 + Manager) and Yellow (2) and £8 to payout. Normally each dividend would pay out £5, but that doesn't allow the manager to pay outall£8. IJBluejorgoes 
a share ef dividends twice,  all £8 could be paid out. Blue and Yellow would take £4 each.

Hobnobbing  Firms.  Any  firm  that  selected  the  "Hobnob" strategy should keep their firm's dividend marker in its present space and not set it to zero to reflect their lack of dividends this turn. 
Finally,  any cash remammg in  the  firm's  India  treasury  should  be moved to its London treasury. 
FIRMS  AND  STORMS 
When rolling for storms during the Events in India phase, treat all firm ships as if they were in the sea zone indicated by the firm's strategy. If the strategy was "Hobnob," firm ships will not be affected by storms. Image

Playing with One or Two 
In the solo and two player game, you will be playing against the Crown. The Crown is  sometimes keen to see the Company succeed, with them becoming the dominant power within the Company. At other times, the Crown seeks for the Company to fail.  You must negotiate with the Crown and influence their decision-making to seize victory for yourself. Sometimes the Crown will make bad decisions for the Company and paying for costly favors may be the only way to keep those decisions in check. You do so via a set of IQ  Crown promise cubes. There is a limited number of promise cubes, so you must do favors for the Crown in return to get promise cubes back. 
The  game  follows  all  of the  standard  multiplayer rules,  with  the  following adjustments: 
SETUP 
Set up a game in any scenario. It is recommended to set up the 1710 scenario for your first game with the Crown. Before dealing setup cards, follow these steps: 
1.	The Crown uses the family board titled "The Crown." 
2.	Give the Crown the family  members of two  players,  so  they have 36 pieces instead of 18. They will first use all of one color when placing family members. 
3.	Divide the IQ  Crown promise cubes equally between the Crown and the human players (i.e. 6 each in a solo game, 4 each in a Q-player game). 
4.	Shuffle the AI cards and place the deck facedown; draw and reveal the topmost card, placing it faceup to the right of the facedown deck. Set the climate marker (use an unused opportunity marker) on the Crown family board, according to the icon on the revealed AI card. 
5.	The Crown sits last in order in respect to whoever was Chairman during setup, or before whichever player is  next in the order of offices if the Crown is themselves the Chairman. 
FINISHING  SETUP  AS A  SOLO  PLAYER 
The Crown acts like two players for solo setup. Shuffle the IQ  setup cards, draw 3 cards, select 1 to keep, and give Q  to the Crown. Repeat this 3 more times, so that you finish with 4 setup cards and the Crown finishes with 8. 
As a variant, players can deal the setup cards randomly. Deal 4 to the soloist and 8 to the Crown. 
FINISHING  SETUP WITH Two PLAYERS 
Set up as a 3-player game with the Crown set up as one family.  Shuffle the 12 setup cards, each player draws 3 cards, selects Q to keep, and gives the remaining card to the Crown. Repeat this  Q  times. Each player and the Crown will have 4 setup cards. 
The Player Button 
Designate one component  or object as  the  Player Button (this could be an unused Crown.firm cube or any unused game component). Give the Player Button  to  the  player  sitting  to  the  right  (counter-clockwise)  or  left (clockwise) of the Crown, according to the direction pointed at by the finger on the current AI card. 
Each time the Crown must decide between the two players, they will select the player holding the Player Button. Likewise, if there is disagreement 
over which of the two players gets to act in a certain situation (e.g. if both wish to perform the same favor with the Crown at the same time), the decision 
goes to the player holding the Player Button. In both cases, that player must then immediately pass the Player Button to the other player. 
A player holding the Player Button may transfer it to the other player as part of a negotiation. 
DIFFICULTY 
You can adjust the difficulty of the Crown as follows: 
r,r Easy. 5 promise cards are available to each player, which can be traded 
for promise cubes (see Crown family board). 
r,r Normal. Promise cards are not available for trading for promise cubes. r,r Hard. As Normal, but also give 4 more promise cubes to the Crown (2 
from each player in 2P). 
r,r Expert. As Hard, but also give the Crown 3 extra setup cards. 
GAMEPLAY 
The Crown Handbook will be used to determine the behavior and interactions of the Crown during each game. The Crown's behavior for any current phase is dictated by the Crown Handbook and often affected by the current climate. However,  players  are  encouraged  to  not  look  beyond  the  phase  they  are currently in within the Handbook. The Crown's climate is determined by the current AI card and tie breaks are often determined by using the current AI card and AI card deck. 
Throughout the game, players can modify the actions of the Crown by spending promise  cubes.  Players  can  gain  promise cubes  by  acting  in ways  that  are beneficial to the Crown. When playing with two players, promise cubes may be used in negotiations and traded between players at anytime. 
BENGAL • m•  ImageImageImage
0®.._  
BOMBAY. 
AI DECK 
You will often need to refer to the current faceup AI card and the AI deck when breaking ties. 
When the Crown must choose between the Presidencies, select the Presidency indicated on the back of the topmost card of the facedown AI deck pointed to by the black arrow (6). If this Presidency is  not suitable, or the Crown must select a second Presidency, select the one indicated by the white arrow (1). If 
the second Presidency is not suitable, then the Crown will select the remaining third Presidency. For example, first select the Madras Presidency,  then Bengal,  then Bombay. 
When the Crown must select a direction, use the direction pointed at by the finger (2). For example, the selected direction is clockwise. 
When the Crown must select one of three cards in a splay, select the card in the position of the shaded card at the top of the AI card (3). If that card is 
not available, select the next card to the right, wrapping around to the left if needed. For example, the Crown would choose the leftmost card in the London Season Display. 
When the Crown changes climate during the Chairman's actions, use the chart to determine their new climate ( 4). For example, if Company Standing is in the first 
or second place, the Crown's climate will change to the peacock. A player cannot affect the game state in any way prior to determining the Crown's new climate after a new AI card is flipped. 
When the Crown must decide between regions, use the region priority given at the bottom of the AI card (s). The Crown selects the leftmost region in the list and proceeds to the right. For example, the Crown would.first choose Madras,  then Mysore,  then Bombay,  then Punjab,  then Delhi,  then Maratha,  then Hyderabad, and lastly Bengal. 
FAVORS AND  PROMISE  CUBES 
In most phases, promise cubes can be exchanged to/from the Crown in a closed economy via a favor. There are two kinds of favors:  favors that require you to pay promise cubes to  the Crown  (indicated with a  red box)  and favors  that force the Crown to give you promise cubes (indicated with a blue box). Most 
favor* s are listed in the Crown Handbook. Favors have two critical restrictions: 
⦁	oFra vsoterps .a  re only available during the resolution of the indicated phase You may perform favors as many times as you wish, but you may never 
perform a favor you cannot fully pay, though you can perform a favor that will gain you less promise cubes than are available from the Crown. 
Some additional favors are listed on the Crown's family board. Unlike favors in the Crown Handbook, these favors can be taken at any time during the timing window described on the Crown's family board. 
Here are some examples of favors: +1  Fit a Crown ship. 
-1  Fit a specific ship. 
In the.first example, you may gain one promise cube for each ship owned by the Crown that you.fit. In the second, you may pay one promise cube to the Crown in order to get the 
Manager if Shipping (if under Crown control) to.fit one efyour ships. 
Some favors have darker boxes with a bold outline. These favors are mandatory and must be performed if the conditions are met. 
CLARIFICATIONS  FOR THE CROWN 
The word "most" refers to having comparatively more or equal of something, with a minimum of 1. The word "fewest" refers to having comparatively less or equal of something, and includes zero. 
If the Crown faces more than one option, the soloist ( or the player holding the Button) may make a free choice between them when the rules do not otherwise make a distinction. 
The "longest" and "shortest" trade route refers to the maximum number of orders a President could fill in one go, irrespective 
of number of ships.

DESIGN  HISTORY  AND  DEDICATION 
The first outlines of John Company's design were sketched out sometime in late 2009  on a porch in Bloomington, Indiana. At that time, I had just discovered Avalon Hill's The Republic of Rome (1990),  and I wanted badly to see more games that explored institutional history.  I made serious attempts to finish a game about the state-sanctioned monopolies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in  2011  and  2013,  but both attempts  floundered.  Then, having completed a couple of smaller designs, I tried again in 2016 and succeeded in finishing the first edition of John Company about a year later. 
The completion of John Company was challenging. At that time, my wife and I were raising our two young sons in a tiny apartment in the University of Texas at Austin's graduate student housing and had barely enough income to keep our little family afloat. The completion of the game coincided with the final stages of my dissertation and our move back to the Midwest. Though I was grateful that I was able to finish the design on time, I also wanted to resist the title someday. 
Shortly after finishing the second edition of Pax Pamir in the winter of 2018,  Drew and I began revising John  Company. The original plan was  to  keep the changes small and largely cosmetic. However, as we dug into the core architecture of the design, we  soon realized that some of the game's foundations would need to be rebuilt. We kept our general priorities close to those which had informed Pax Pamir's redevelopment.  We wanted  the new edition  to  offer a  beautiful but sensible production that strengthened the game's foundations and made the full scope of the design more accessible. 
The second crowdfunding campaign for Pax Pamir performed twice as well as the first, and gave Drew and I some much needed breathing room that allowed us to spend an additional year preparing John Company before we began public testing. We showed our work for the first time publicly at the 2020  San Diego Historical Games Convention at the invitation of Harold Buchanan. The show gave Drew and I the confidence to push the game into public playtesting and schedule a Kickstarter for the spring of 2021.  The campaign raised nearly $800,000  and allowed us to pursue the most ambitious production we've ever attempted. 
As with the development of Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile (2020 ), John Company benefited from a large group of remote playtesters. These testers were hosted on the Wehrlegig Games & Friends Discord server and participated in nearly constant discussion of the game. At times, it was overwhelming to juggle this discussion with my own playtesting, editing, and graphic design work. But, the game is much better for that conversation. I am immensely proud of our work over the past year, and I truly think that we have all built something really special together. The final design is a testament to their care and attention. 
This was a very difficult project to complete, and Drew and I are both grateful for the support of our friends and families who, among other things, tolerated our many unscheduled work sessions. We love you all  so much and promise to spend less  time talking about global commerce in the eighteenth century and debating the merits of different punchboard  thicknesses. Furthermore, I would like to dedicate this game to my partner Cati who helped me through problems both big and small this year and to my brother Drew, who, perhaps more than any other person, has made the work of our little company possible. 

READING  EMPIRE'S  ORIGIN  STORY 
There are many games about empires.  In most, their existence and their internal coherence is  taken for granted. This makes for clean design but very bad history. No empire springs into being fully-formed. Their genealogies are as messy as their modes of operation. John Company embraces this complexity and attempts to tell one small part of the origin story of the British Empire. In the game, players take the role of ambitious families who are interested in advancing themselves in polite society and who  see  in the  British East India Company a means to  that end.  In some respects, this is  a game about the ordinary actors of empire and how often well-meaning and decent people can do some truly evil things to advance their own prospects. 
However,  there are limits  to  what a  game can do.  Games excel at manipulating our sympathies and making otherwise remote situations feel immediate. To do this, they often bend the historical record for narrative and argumentative effect. John Company is no different. It is essentially a work of historical fiction, which, I hope, reveals its subject and encourages its players to dig deeper. 
When it comes to learning more about the Company, there are numerous excellent starting places. The best single volume account remains John Keay's The Honourable Company (1991). Those interested in primary documents should take a look at the 
amazing first volume of the Archives ef Empire (2003) edited by Barbara Harlow and Mia Carter. For those wanting to understand the damage the Company wrought and the insidious half-life of many of its policies, see Shashi Tharoor's brisk and brilliant Inglorious Empire (2018). Those hoping to better understand the particular context 
of the Company's dramatic rise in the middle of the eighteenth century should look at William Dalrymple's The Anarchy (2019). Dalrymple's book is beautifully written and very engaging. 
Those wishing to  explore  more  stories  of the  families  that  made  the  Company possible should look at The East India Company at Home, 1757-1857 (2018) edited by Margot  Finn and  Kate Smith and its  companion blog  (both  are  available  freely online).  Much can also be gained by reading any number of nineteenth century novels. I'd suggest in particular William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair (1847-
48) and The Newcomes  (1854-55)  and Charles Dickens's Dombey and Son  (1846-48). Those with access to an academic library should also check out Jean Sutton's very expensive but interesting The East India Company's Maritime Service 1746-1834 (2010). 
For those looking to go deeper, a full picture of how the Company operated and made money can be found in K. N. Chaudhuri' s The Trading World efA sia and the East 
India Company 1660-1760 (1978). This is nicely supplemented by C. A. Bayly's Indian Society and the Making ef the British Empire (1998). Though covering an earlier period 
than the game,  I'd also  suggest Philip J. Stern's The  Company-State (2011), which describes the foundations of the Company and illuminates the larger patterns of its behavior, especially in the context of British politics. The later part of that story can be found in Lucy Sutherland's The East India Company in Eighteenth-Century Politics (1952). 
Finally, for those interested in exploring some of the bigger questions of national identity and culture, I would suggest starting with Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities  (1983),  Edward  Said's  Culture  and  Imperialism  (1993),  and  Saree Makdisi's Making England Western (2014).

to Enlist Writer in that Presidency.

# Solo Rules

This aid is intended to help you to walk step-by-step through a solo game. This document is a combination of the rules in the Crown Handbook and Rules book. The 2-player rules are not included. In this document, ‘You’ refers to the solo player, while third-person pronouns (e.g., the Chairman) refer to both you and the Crown. The Crown is also considered a ‘player’ for game rules.
Setup	Basic Favours

1.	Setup the Crown board. Use a glass opportunity marker to track the Crown’s Climate
2.	The Crown uses two sets of family members (36 total). 3.	Take 6 red promise cubes for yourself and give the other
6 cubes to the Crown.
4.	Setup any scenario as normal (remember that Company Balance always starts at £5). For the setup cards, shuffle the 12 basic cards (no ‘extra’ cards) and draw the top 3 cards. Choose 1 to keep and give the other 2 to the Crown. Repeat this 3 times. Alternately, deal yourself 4 random setup cards and deal the Crown 8.
5.	Shuffle the AI cards and reveal the top card to set the Crown’s initial Climate.

Basic Favours can be done any time between the start of the Firms phase and the end of the Revenues phase. These are also described on the Crown board.


Difficulty

 Easy:Start with5promise cards,whichcanbe traded for promise cubes.
 Normal: Do not use promise cards.
 Hard: As Normal, but the Crown also starts with 10 promise cubes.
 Expert: As Hard, but deal 3 ‘Extra’ cards to Crown.  Legendary: Do not use promise cards, the Crown starts with all 12 promise cubes and 6 ‘extra’ setup cards. If the company fails, select ‘Court of Directors Blameless’; the Crown benefitsfrom this, you do not.







You are now ready to start the game!

Each region may only Cascade once per event.

Crisis	Use Elephant position to determine the Crisis type and follow flowchart on next page.
Roll Storm die: Resolve an invasion in each of Bombay/Madras/Bengal adjacent to rolled sea zone(s) (top of deck Foreign	region if ‘4’ rolled). For each, follow Invasion steps, but roll a die for attack strength. If invasion succeeds: Close all Invasion	orders and set tower level = ½ invasion strength (round down); If Elephant is inside a conquered Company-

Crown Policy Selection
The Crown chooses a policy where they have the greatest advantage / least disadvantage in enterprises compared with you (for Tax, where they will pay relatively less than you). Break ties with the AI card (counter)clockwise arrows.



Policies
Each player must pay £1 for each of the listed enterprise they own, or they lose that enterprise. If a Shipyard with a fitted ship is lost, the ship remains in play, but the Shipyard cannot be reclaimed.*
If a Window Tax is indicated, each player must also pay £1 for each Window on their family members’ prizes and enterprises. If the tax cannot be paid, the asset is lost (return the family member to supply). *

Each player gains £1 for each of the listed enterprise they own.

Swap the positions of the indicated Power marker and the next higher marker on the Power track. If already in the highest position, swap the positions of any other 2 Power markers (The Crown will swap the 2 lowest Power markers in this case).
*The Crown will use ‘Royal Privilege’ as needed to pay taxes (see below).

Royal Privilege
If the Crown cannot afford to pay a tax, they will use funds from the Company Balance. The Crown will force the Company to take emergency loans as required. In this case, if the Crown is Chairman, they will always discard ‘Royal Protection’ if it is available.

21.  Upkeep and Refresh
1. Upkeep
Each player must pay the upkeep cost for each family member’s prize or lose that prize (and its VP). The Crown will use Royal Privilege as needed to pay their upkeep (see above).
2. Refresh
1.	Return all Writers to their associated Presidency.




2.	Return any Filled Order tokens to supply. 3.	Return Extra Ships to supply.
4.	Return exhausted Officers/Regiments to active. Active local alliances become exhausted. 5.	Advance the turn marker and begin the next turn.
22.  Game End & Scoring
The game ends at the end of the last turn of the scenario, or immediately if the Company fails. Proceed to final scoring:

1.	Base Victory Points: Players score VPs for retirement prizes, luxuries and spouses.
2.	Power Award: The player with the most Power scores the higher VP according to the final game turn. Power comes from:  Each Share/Workshop/Luxury/Shipyard is worth 0-2 Power according to the Power track.
 +1 Power for each passed law and trophy.
 Blackmail cards in your player area may provide Power. (Check the Crown’s Blackmail cards now).  The player who is Prime Minister gains +2 Power.
3.	Court & Workshops: If the Company survived, each share is worth the VP value noted in the Court. If the Company failed, Shares are worth negative VP and players score 1 VP for each Workshop they own.
4.    Firms: For each firm share, gain/lose VP according to the firm’s value. Lose 1 VP per family member in Debtor’s Prison. 5.    Final Retirement: If the Company survived, make one final Attrition roll and retire any pensioners (do not gain any
Prestige cards). Regardless of Company success, shareholders in a firm may also perform a final special retirement. [Hard/Expert/Legendary: The Crown will spend as much as possible on final retirements.]
6.	Consequences of Failure: If the Company failed, draw a Company failure card and resolve it.
7.	Finally, if the Company failed, you (not the Crown) adjust your VP according to the table to the right.
8.	The player with the most VP (even if negative) is the winner! (Break ties with most Windows, then Prime Minister).
