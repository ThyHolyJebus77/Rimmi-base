2. Start the comic: Flip the top card from the deck to start the comic strip.
3. Judge plays second panel: The judge plays a card from their hand next to the first panel.
4. Players submit punchlines: Other players choose a card from their hand to complete the comic and place it face-down.
5. Judging: The judge shuffles the submissions, reveals them, and chooses their favorite punchline.
6. Scoring: The player who submitted the winning punchline keeps their card as a point.
7. New round: Everyone draws back up to 7 cards, and the role of judge passes to the next player.
8. Red card rule: If a red-bordered card is drawn as the first panel, skip step 3 and have all players submit two cards to create the full comic.

# Joking Hazard - Rules

How To Get Started:

Print in color on high quality card stock.
1 Use a good printer, not your mom's
crappy one from the nineties.

Cut along the dotted lines. Most print
2 shops will machine cut it for you if you
ask.

We recommend you shuffle well before
3 your first playthrough, to maximize
randomness.

Main Rules

Everyone draws 7 cards. Place the rest in
a deck, face down on the table. Pick the
first judge through non-violent means.

The deck plays first. Flip the top card off
the deck. This is the starter panel.

The judge plays second, by placing a
card from their hand on either side of the
starter panel, creating a two panel setup.

The other players play a card, face down,
at the end of the setup to create the
punchline. The judge shuffles the
punchlines and puts them face down one

at a time, and then picks their favorite.
The winning player takes their card back
for scorekeeping.

Everyone draws another card (you should
always have 7). Going clockwise, the
next person becomes judge, and so on.
The first player to 3 points is the winner,
or whatever score you wanna go to
(we're not your mom).

Red Cards

When a card has a red border, it can only
be played as a third panel. If the deck
plays a red card, the judge does not play
a second panel. Instead, everyone else
plays the two panel setup, and the judge

picks their favorite. Whoever wins gets
two points instead of one. Bonus!

Alternative Rules

Joking Hazard is very open-ended, and
we definitely suggest tweaking the rules
with your friends. Here are some of our
favorite alternative ways to play:

Jerk Mode: Same as the default rules,
except when the deck plays a red card,

instead of it being a bonus round, the
judge keeps the red card as a free point,
and forces someone else to lose a point.
It's like a ticking time bomb of unfairness.

Marathon: Instead of 3 points winning
the game, keep playing until the the deck
runs out. Whoever has the most points at
that time wins. If it's a tie, the lowest
scoring player becomes judge and plays
two panels, and everyone who is tied
plays the punchline.

Neverending Story: Remove all the red
cards from the deck. Everyone takes 10
cards. Going clockwise, each player adds
a panel, creating one super long comic.
The rest of the players can reject a panel
if it doesn't make sense, via majority vote.
If you can't play a card that makes sense,
trade any card from your hand for two
additional cards, and skip your turn. First
player to run out of cards wins.
