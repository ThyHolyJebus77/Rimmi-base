## Quick Start Rules Guide

1. Setup:
   - Each player chooses a clan and gets their clan screen, figures, and starting coins.
   - Place the map in the center of the table.
   - Shuffle and place the season cards nearby.

2. Game Structure:
   - The game is played over 3 seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn).
   - Each season has 4 phases: Tea Ceremony, Political, War, and Cleanup.

3. Tea Ceremony:
   - Players can form alliances with one other player.
   - Allies share benefits during the Political phase.

4. Political Phase:
   - Players take turns choosing actions from the available political mandates.
   - Actions include recruiting troops, moving forces, or buying season cards.
   - Your ally also benefits when you choose an action.

5. War Phase:
   - Battles happen in provinces marked for war.
   - Players secretly bid coins on war advantages (like taking hostages or committing seppuku).
   - The player with the most force in a province wins, earning victory points.

6. Managing Resources:
   - Use coins to bid in battles and buy season cards.
   - Collect ronin (mercenary tokens) for extra strength in battles.

7. Winning the Game:
   - At the end of the third season, the player with the most victory points wins.
   - Earn points by winning battles, controlling provinces, and completing objectives on season cards.

Remember, alliances can be powerful but may change each season. Don't be afraid to negotiate and make deals with other players!

## Factions/Civilizations
- Koi Clan: Can convert coins to ronin during battles
- Dragonfly Clan: Can summon and move figures to any province
- Lotus Clan: Can bluff about selected political mandates
- Bonsai Clan: Pays a maximum of 1 coin for any purchase
- Turtle Clan: Can move strongholds and count them as force in battles

## Additional Notes
The game features a unique combat system where players bid secretly on different war advantages rather than directly fighting with units. This creates interesting strategic decisions and bluffing opportunities during battles.

# Rising Sun - Rules

## SETUP

Each player chooses a clan and places their clan screen in
front of them and a political/war tile behind it (political side
faceup). Nothing should be hidden behind your screen during
the Political phase. During the War phase, bids are hidden
behind the screens, but nothing else.

Place 1 of your clan markers on the first space of the
victory point track.

All players check their starting honor rank (shown on their clan
screen) and place their other clan marker on the honor track,
in order with the lowest numbered rank at the top and with no
spaces between markers.

Players must sit in increasing order of starting honor rank,
going clockwise around the table. The clan with the lowest
numbered starting rank will be the first to play, and play will
then proceed in clockwise order. Sitting/play order stays the
same throughout the game.

Place your clan’s Daimyo figure (with a black base), 3 Shinto
figures (with white bases), and 6 Bushi figures next to your clan
screen, in sight of the other players. This is your reserve. Take
all the plastic bases in your clan’s color (these will be used if to
identify your monsters).

All figures have 1 force, unless otherwise stated on a player’s
specific season card.

Take your 4 stronghold tokens and your alliance token.

Each player places 1 Daimyo figure, 1 Bushi figure, and 1
stronghold token in their home province (shown on their clan
screen).

Shuffle the 7 shrine tiles facedown, draw 4 and place them
faceup on the shrine slots on the board, from left to right.
Return the remaining tiles to the box.

Place the core season cards facedown next to the board in 3
separate decks: Spring, Summer, and Autumn. Players choose
(or pick randomly) which set of season cards they will use in
this game: take its 5 cards for each of the seasons and add
them to the core decks. Each of the season decks should then
contain 12 cards. Return all other season cards to the box.

Separate the war province tokens according to their number: I,
II, and III, and shuffle them into 3 facedown piles, each with 8
tokens. Place them next to the board.

Place all the war number tokens next to the board.

Shuffle the 10 political mandate tiles facedown and place them
in a pile next to the board.

Place all monster figures, and common piles of coins and ronin
tokens, next to the board. Coins and ronin tokens are the only
unlimited resource.

## HONOR

```
The clan with their marker at the top of the honor track has
the highest honor, while the clan at the bottom has the lowest
honor. If a clan’s marker is above another’s, it has higher honor
than them; if a clan’s marker is below another’s, it has lower
honor than them.
In any tie, the tied player with the highest honor wins.
```
```
If there’s a conflict in the timing of an ability, the involved
player with higher honor decides whether to go first or last.
```
```
No two clans can ever occupy the same slot on the honor track.
Each time you gain/lose honor, move your marker up 1 slot/
down 1 slot on the track, at the same time moving down 1 slot/
up 1 slot the marker that was above/below it.
```
```
If you are already at the top of the track, gaining honor has no
effect. If you are already at the bottom (disregarding any empty
slots at the bottom), losing honor has no effect.
```
## NEGOTIATION

```
Players can make deals at any point in the game, whether with
their ally or with an enemy. No deals are binding, and deals can
be made in secret.
```
```
Bribery can only be done during the Tea Ceremony and the
Political phase, not during the War phase. Players may give
coins and ronin tokens from their reserve to other players to try
to convince them to do something.
```
## GAME ROUND (SEASON)

## 1. SEASONAL SETUP

## Prepare for War

```
Take the randomized war province tokens for the current
season (I = Spring, II = Summer, III = Autumn) and place them
faceup on the war province slots on the board. Place a number
of tokens equal to the number of players plus 2.
```
```
Then place the war number tokens in the war number slots
of the provinces indicated by the war province tokens on the
board. Return any unused war number tokens to the box.
```
## Set Season Cards

```
Discard any season cards left next to the board from the
previous season. Place all the current season’s cards faceup
next to board, within reach of all players. Identical cards may
be placed on top of each other, staggered to show the number
of piled cards.
```
## Seasonal Income

```
Players should have no coins at this point. Each player then
takes a number of coins from the common pile equal to their
seasonal income (as shown on their clan screen).
```
## Return Hostages

```
Players return any figures they have taken hostage to their
owners, getting 1 coin from the common pile for each figure
returned.
```
## 2. TEA CEREMONY

```
Any alliances from a previous season are unmade, and players
have the opportunity to negotiate new alliances.
```
```
Alliances are between pairs of players, who must both be in
agreement.
```
```
The allied players join their alliance tokens together and place
them in view of all players. Alliances last for the current season
(unless broken by a Betray mandate), and no new alliances can
be made until the next season.
Allied players grant each other powerful bonuses from the
mandates they play during the Political phase.
Allied players don’t fight each other during the War phase if
they are the only ones in a province. Victory goes automatically
to the one with the highest force.
In a battle involving 2 allied players and other players, if one
of the allied players is victorious, they don’t kill the figures of
their ally.
Allied players are still considered opponents for the purpose of
season card abilities and other effects.
If an allied player plays the Betray mandate, they immediately
lose honor and the alliance is broken.
If the game ends in a tie between allied players, they share the
victory.
```
## 3. POLITICAL PHASE

```
Players take turns selecting political mandates to prepare their
clans and position their forces. As shown on the political track
on the board, the phase follows this order:
3 Mandate turns > Kami turn > 2 Mandate turns > Kami turn
> 2 Mandate turns > Kami turn > War phase starts
```
```
At the start of the game, the player whose clan is at the top of
the honor track takes the deck of political mandates to play
the first mandate turn. At the start of the following seasons,
the first player to perform a mandate turn is the one to the
left of the player who performed the last mandate turn on the
previous Season. Keep the deck of political mandates close to
the player who will play it next.
The player who has deck of political mandates draws the top
4 mandate tiles, looks at them in secret, chooses one, and
returns the other 3 facedown to the top of the deck, without
reshuffling.
```
```
They then place the chosen political mandate faceup on the
first available political mandate slot on the board (from left to
right).
```
```
One by one, in clockwise order starting with the player to the
left of the player, each player performs the chosen mandate.
The effects of each mandate are summarized on each player’s
political tile. Except for the Betray mandate, all mandates have
2 components: one part that all players may perform and one
bonus part that only the current player and their ally (if they
have any) may perform.
```
```
Only the player who selected it and their ally are allowed to also
perform the mandate’s bonus.
```
```
When all players have performed the mandate, the current
player passes the facedown deck of remaining political
mandates to the player to their left, who becomes the next
current player and executes the next mandate turn, if any.
```
## Recruit

```
All players You may summon 1 of the figures you have in
reserve to each of the provinces where you have a stronghold.
If you have more than 1 stronghold in the same province, you
may summon a number of figures there equal to the number of
strongholds there.
```
```
There is no limit to the number of figures that may occupy each
of the provinces. If you have no more figures in your reserve,
you cannot summon another figure.
Current player and their ally You may summon 1 additional
figure to any one of your strongholds, even if you have already
summoned a figure there.
```
```
Summoning Shinto When you summon a Shinto warrior (and
only at the moment when it is summoned), you may choose to
immediately take it from the province where it was summoned
and place it on any of the 4 shrine tiles on the top of the board.
There is no limit to the number of Shinto figures that may
occupy each of the shrines.
```
```
A Shinto worshipping at one of the shrines is not considered
to be on the map, and cannot be moved to the map or to a
different shrine.
```
## Marshall

```
All players You may move each of the figures you have on the
map to an adjacent province (either crossing a border or taking
a shipping route). You may move any number of your figures (or
none). Each figure can only be moved once.
```
```
Current player and their ally You may discard 3 coins to the
common pile, take 1 stronghold from your reserve, and place
it in any province. It doesn’t have to be adjacent to a province
where you already have a stronghold, and there is no limit to
the number of strongholds in each province. You cannot build
more than your 4 strongholds.
```
## Train

```
Unlike other mandates, the player who selects this mandate
performs it first, having first pick of the available cards.
```
```
All players You may get 1 of the season cards currently
displayed next to the board by paying its coin cost to the
common pile (some cards are free). Place the new season
card faceup next to your clan screen. Its ability is considered
immediately in effect. You may get more than 1 copy of the
same card over subsequent trainings, in which case their
abilities stack together.
```
```
Current player and ally If you get a season card, you may pay
1 less coin than its listed cost (to a minimum of 0). You can still
only get a single season card per Train mandate.
```
```
Monsters When you get a monster season card, you also take
the corresponding monster figure, attach one of your counter
bases to it, and immediately summon it to any province where
you have a stronghold. The monster now counts as one of your
clan’s figures, and has 1 force, unless otherwise stated. If it’s
killed, it returns to their reserve and may be summoned again
to the map like a normal clan figure. There is no limit to the
number of monsters a clan may have.
```
## harvest

```
All players You gain 1 coin from the common pile.
```
```
Current player and their ally You collect the rewards listed for
every province where you currently have the most force. As
always, if there’s a tie, the tied player with the highest honor is
considered to have the most force in the province.
```
```
Victory Point Move your clan marker up 1 slot on
the victory point track at the bottom of the board.
```
```
Coin Take 1 coin from the common pile.
```
```
Ronin Take 1 ronin token from the common pile.
```

## betray

Betray only benefits the current player. If the player is in an
alliance, it is immediately broken and the betraying player loses
honor. If the betraying player was not in an alliance, they do
not lose honor.

Choose up to 2 figures on the map, belonging to 2 different
players, and immediately replace them with figures of the same
type that you have in their own reserve. You cannot replace 2
figures belonging to the same player, replace an opponent’s
figure with one of yours that is already on the board, or replace
an opponent’s figure with one from your reserve that’s a
different type. You cannot replace a figure if you don’t have a
figure in reserve of the same type. A monster in reserve can be
used to replace another monster.

The replaced figures are returned to their owners’ reserves
(though they are not considered to have been killed). If you just
broke your alliance, you don’t necessarily have to replace one
of the figures of your former ally.

Daimyo figures and Shinto figures on the shrines are not
affected by betrayal.

Replacing a figure is not considered a summon (Shinto cannot
be sent to worship).

Kami turns
Players resolve the effects of each of the 4 shrine tiles in order,
starting from the leftmost and proceeding to the right. In each
shrine, the clan with the most force immediately executes the
benefit granted by that shrine’s kami before resolving the next
shrine.

If there’s a tie, the tied player with the highest honor is
considered to have the most force. If a shrine has no Shinto on
it, it’s skipped during this kami turn.

Amaterasu allows you to move your clan marker straight to
the top slot on the honor track, shifting all others down in the
process. This may change the honor tiebreaker when resolving
the following shrines in this kami turn.

Fujin allows you to perform up to 2 moves with your figures on
the map. You may either move 2 of your figures to adjacent
provinces, or 1 of your figures twice in a row; either across a
border or along a shipping route between provinces.

Raijin allows you to summon 1 Bushi from your reserve and
place it in any province on the map, even if you don’t have a
stronghold there.

Ryujin allows you to get a season card from those available,
paying its full coin cost just like in a Train mandate.

Hachiman grants you ronin tokens from the common pile.

Susanoo grants you a number of VPs equal to the number of
strongholds you currently have on the map.

Tsukuyomi grants you coins, taken from the common pile.

## 4. WAR PHASE

All players flip their political/war tiles to the war side. Resolve
any war upgrade season cards. At Start of War Phase effects
take place at the start of the War phase of each season, not at
the start of each battle.

During the War phase, players cannot freely give each other
coins or ronin tokens as part of their negotiations.

Each season, there will only be war in the provinces marked
with a war number token.

```
Starting with the number 1 province and proceeding in
ascending order, war is resolved in each province, one at a
time:
If nobody has any force in the province, nothing happens and
the war province token is discarded.
If only 1 player has any force in the province, they take the
war province token and place it, faceup, next to their clan
screen.
```
```
If only 2 allied players have force in the province, no battle
takes place. The player with the most force there takes the war
province token and places it, faceup, next to their clan screen.
On a tie, the tied player with the highest honor is considered to
have the most force in the province.
If at least 2 players who are not allied have force in the
province, a battle takes place to determine the winner.
```
## 5. SEASONAL CLEANUP

```
Discard coins and ronin: Return all coins and ronin tokens in
players’ reserves to the common pile.
```
```
Return Shinto: Return all figures on the shrine tiles are to their
owners’ reserves.
```
```
Return political mandates: Shuffle the political mandates on
the board back with the deck of political mandates.
```
## WINTER SEASON ENDGAME

```
The only season setup step that must be executed during
Winter is Return Hostages. Players may then gain extra VPs for
the following:
```
```
Winter upgrades: These season cards grant extra VPs
depending on different criteria.
War province tokens: Each war province token a player
collected grants the number of VPs listed on it, depending on
the season in which it was won:
Spring = 1 VP Summer = 2 VPs Autumn = 3 VPs
```
```
War province set bonus: Players get a VP bonus according
to the number of war province tokens they accumulated of
different provinces. Only tokens of different provinces count:
```
```
## different war province tokens VP bonus
3-4 10 VPs
5-6 20 VPs
7-8 30 VPs
```
```
Record your VPs with your clan marker on the VP track. If you
go beyond 50, move your marker back to the 1 slot and flip it
upside down to remember to add 50 points to your score.
```
```
The player with the most VPs is the winner. On a tie, the tied
player with the highest honor is the winner. If 2 allied players
are tied in first place, they share the victory.
```
## RESOLVING BATTLES

```
Battles only take place in provinces where at least 2 players
who are not allied with each other have force.
```
```
The battle involves all players who have any force in that
province, even if they are allied.
```
```
Before a battle begins, all players clearly display their coins and
ronin tokens next to their clan screens and truthfully answer
how many coins and ronin tokens they have, if asked.
```
```
First, any Start of a Battle abilities trigger. Then, the involved
players take all their coins behind their clan screen and,
simultaneously and in secret, allocate them to the different war
advantage spots on their war tile. You may allocate any number
of coins to each spot (including 0). Place any you don’t wish to
allocate behind the screen, below the war tile.
```
```
Once all players declare that they are done allocating their
coins, they all lift their clan screens simultaneously, revealing
their bids. Coins placed outside the war tile don’t count for this
battle and are returned to that player’s reserve.
```
```
Players then compare the number of coins allocated by each
player in each of the slots, starting from the leftmost and
proceeding to the right. Each war advantage is won by the
player who bid the most coins on it. If there’s a tie, the tied
player with the highest honor is considered to have the most
coins in that war advantage. If no players bid any coins on a war
advantage, it is skipped and the next one is resolved.
```
```
Only the player who wins a war advantage may execute it.
You may choose not to execute a war advantage you won.
```
```
When all provinces with a war number token have been
resolved, the War phase comes to an end.
```
```
War advantages are resolved one by one, from left to right.
```
## SEPPUKU

```
The winner may choose to immediately kill all their figures in
the province, gaining 1 VP and honor for each figure. If you
decide to perform Seppuku, you must kill all of your figures,
and you are still in the battle, even if you no longer have any
figures in the province.
```
## TAKE HOSTAGE

```
The winner may choose to capture 1 figure in the province
belonging to another player (even their ally). Remove the
chosen figure from the province and place it next to your clan
screen. It is only returned to its owner during the setup of the
next season (the figure has not been killed, only captured).
```
```
If you Take a Hostage, you also steal 1 VP from the clan that
owns the captured figure. Move that clan’s marker back 1 slot
on the VP track, and move your marker forward 1 slot. If the
targeted clan doesn’t have any VPs, you don’t get any VPs.
```
```
Daimyo are immune to this effect and cannot be targeted by
this war advantage.
```
## HIRE RONIN

```
The winner may choose to add their ronin tokens to their forces
in the province: for each token they have in reserve, they gain
+1 force to determine the outcome of the battle.
Ronin tokens are not spent when they are used, and all of them
will be available to be hired again in a following battle.
If a player with no ronin tokens wins Hire Ronin, they don’t get
to add any force to their figures.
```
## BATTLE OUTCOME

```
Players compare the total force they have in the province.
```
```
The clan with the most force wins the battle and places the war
province token faceup next to their clan screen. If there’s a tie,
the tied player with the highest honor is considered to have the
most force in the province.
```
```
All the figures in the province belonging to the players who lost
the battle are immediately killed. If one of the losers is allied
with the winning player, their figures are not killed.
```
```
If, at the end of a battle, no players have any force left in the
province, the player with the highest honor wins.
```
## IMPERIAL POETS

```
The winning player gains VPs equal to the total number of
figures that were killed in the course of this battle. It doesn’t
matter who owned the figures, nor how they were killed. To
easily count them, keep killed figures separate from each
player’s reserves until Imperial Poets has been resolved.
```
```
War reparations
All losing players discard all coins they allocated on the war tile
to the common pile.
The winning player gives all coins they allocated on their war
tile to the losing players. Distribute them equally among the
losing players, who place them in their reserves to use in the
following battles. If the number of coins can’t be distributed
equally, the winning player decides which player(s) should get
an extra coin.
```
## CLANS

## Koi Clan

```
At the start of the War phase, the Koi player must discard all
ronin tokens they have and take the same number of coins
from the common pile.
```
```
When resolving the Hire Ronin step of a battle, all coins the Koi
player has in their reserve count as ronin tokens.
```
## DragonflFly Clan

```
When the Dragonfly player summons one of their figures, it
can be placed in any province, whether they have a stronghold
there or not. The number of figures they can summon with a
Recruit mandate is still tied to the number of strongholds they
have on the map.
```
```
When the Dragonfly player moves one of their figures, it can
be placed in any province on the map, no matter how far. Their
figures never have to use shipping routes to move from one
province to another.
```
## Lotus Clan

```
On their mandate turns, the Lotus player selects one of the 4
political mandates they drew and places it facedown on the
board, without any of the players seeing what it is. The Lotus
player then announces what political mandate will be executed,
choosing anything they want.
```
## Bonsai Clan

```
The cost of everything the Bonsai clan buys, season card or
a stronghold, is limited to 1 coin at most. If it cost 2 or more
coins, it costs 1 coin; if it cost 0 coins, it remains free.
```
```
In case the Bonsai player benefits from a discount, such as the
Train mandate bonus, it applies after the clan ability, bringing
the cost to 0.
```
## Turtle Clan

```
When the Turtle player moves their figures, they can choose to
move their strongholds as well, just as if they were clan figures.
Each Turtle clan stronghold also counts as 1 force in the
province they occupy, exactly as if they were clan figures. This
may influence both Harvest and War. However, strongholds
may never be killed, never be Taken Hostage, and never be
replaced by a Betray mandate.
```

## GAME ROUND (SEASON)

## 1. SEASONAL SETUP

## Prepare for War

Place [no. players plus 2] random war province tokens for the
current season (I = Spring, II = Summer, III = Autumn) faceup
on war province slots. Place the war number tokens in the
slots of the indicated provinces.

## Set Season Cards

Discard old season cards and place all the current season’s
cards faceup next to board.

## Seasonal Income

Each player takes coins equal to their seasonal income.

## Return Hostages

Return any hostages to their owners, getting 1 coin for each.

## 2. TEA CEREMONY

Players may negotiate alliances.

Allied players don’t fight each other during the War
phase if they are the only ones in a province. Victory goes
automatically to the one with the highest force.

In a battle involving 2 allies and other players, if one of the
allies is victorious, they don’t kill the figures of their ally.

Allied players are still considered opponents for the purpose
of season card abilities and other effects.

If an allied player plays the Betray mandate, they immediately
lose honor and the alliance is broken.

Allied players that tie for winning the game share the victory.

## 3. POLITICAL PHASE

the start of each battle.
```
```
During the War phase, players cannot freely give each other
coins or ronin tokens as part of their negotiations.
```
```
Each season, there will only be war in the provinces marked
with a war number token. Starting with the number 1 province
and proceeding in ascending order, war is resolved in each
province, one at a time:
```
```
If nobody has any force in the province, nothing happens and
the war province token is discarded.
```
```
If only 1 player has any force in the province, they take the
war province token.
```
```
If only 2 allied players have force in the province, no battle
takes place. The player with the most force there takes the
war province token.

province, a battle takes place to determine the winner.
```
## 5. SEASONAL CLEANUP

## GAME ROUND (SEASON)

## 1. SEASONAL SETUP

## Prepare for War

```
Place [no. players plus 2] random war province tokens for the
current season (I = Spring, II = Summer, III = Autumn) faceup
on war province slots. Place the war number tokens in the
slots of the indicated provinces.
```
## Set Season Cards

```

cards faceup next to board.
```
## Seasonal Income

## Return Hostages

```
Return any hostages to their owners, getting 1 coin for each.
```
## 2. TEA CEREMONY

```
Players may negotiate alliances.
```
```
Allied players don’t fight each other during the War
phase if they are the only ones in a province. Victory goes
automatically to the one with the highest force.
```
```
In a battle involving 2 allies and other players, if one of the
allies is victorious, they don’t kill the figures of their ally.
```
```
Allied players are still considered opponents for the purpose
of season card abilities and other effects.
```
```
If an allied player plays the Betray mandate, they immediately
lose honor and the alliance is broken.
Allied players that tie for winning the game share the victory.

## RESOLVING BATTLES

Battles only take place in provinces where at least 2 players
who are not allied with each other have force. All players who
have any force there are involved, even if they are allied.

Before a battle begins, all players display their coins and ronin
tokens next to their clan screens and truthfully answer how
many coins and ronin tokens they have, if asked.

First, any Start of a Battle abilities trigger. Then, the
players take all their coins behind their clan screen and,
simultaneously and in secret, allocate any number of them to
the war advantage spots on their war tile. Place any you don’t
wish to allocate below the war tile.

All players then lift their clan screens simultaneously. Coins
placed outside the war tile don’t count and are returned to
that player’s reserve.

Players then compare the number of coins allocated by each
player in each of the slots, starting from the leftmost and
proceeding to the right.

Each war advantage is won by the player who bid the most
coins on it. On a tie, the tied player with the highest honor
wins. If no players bid any coins on a war advantage, it is
skipped.

Only the player who wins a war advantage may choose to
execute it.

When all provinces with a war number token have been
resolved, the War phase comes to an end.

## SEPPUKU

```
The winner may choose to immediately kill all their figures in
the province, gaining 1 VP and honor for each figure. You must
kill all of your figures, and you are still in the battle, even if you
no longer have any figures in the province.
```
## TAKE HOSTAGE

```
The winner may choose to capture 1 figure in the province
belonging to another player (even their ally). Place it next to
your clan screen; it is only returned to its owner during the
setup of the next season.
```
```
If you Take a Hostage, you also steal 1 VP from the clan that
owns the captured figure. If the targeted clan doesn’t have
any VPs, you don’t get any VPs.
```
```
Daimyo are immune to this effect and cannot be targeted by
this war advantage.
```
## HIRE RONIN

```
The winner may choose to add their ronin tokens to their
forces in the province: for each token they have in reserve,
they gain +1 force.
```
```
Ronin tokens are not spent when they are used.
```
## BATTLE OUTCOME

```
The clan with the most force in the province wins the battle
and places the war province token faceup next to their clan
screen. On a tie, the tied player with the highest honor wins.
All the figures in the province belonging to the players who
lost the battle are immediately killed. If one of the losers is
allied with the winning player, their figures are not killed.
```
```
If, at the end of a battle, no players have any force left in the
province, the player with the highest honor wins.
```
## IMPERIAL POETS

```
The winning player gains VPs equal to the total number of
figures that were killed in the course of this battle. It doesn’t
matter who owned the figures, nor how they were killed.
Keep killed figures separate from each player’s reserves until
Imperial Poets has been resolved.
```
```
War reparations
All losing players discard all coins they allocated on the war
tile to the common pile.
```
```
The winning player gives all coins they allocated on their war
tile to the losing players. Distribute them equally among the
losing players, who place them in their reserves to use in the
following battles. If the number of coins can’t be distributed
equally, the winning player decides which player(s) should get
an extra coin.
