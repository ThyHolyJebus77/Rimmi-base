## Factions/Civilizations
- Naboo: Focuses on protecting the Queen, utilizing Jedi, and completing Anakin's starfighter mission. More defensive playstyle.
- Trade Federation: Aims to overwhelm with droid armies, protect Viceroys, and prevent Anakin from destroying the control ship. More aggressive playstyle.

## Additional Notes
The game's multi-area design requires players to balance their efforts across different battlefields, adding strategic depth and replicating the feel of the movie's climactic sequence.

# Star Wars The Queen's Gambit - Rules

## Setup

Set up the boards and place figures as indicated in the
rules. Shuffle the **Starfighter** cards, the **Naboo Battlefield**
cards, the **Naboo Palace** cards, the **Trade Federation (TF)
Battlefield** cards and the **TF Palace** cards into separate
decks.

Place damage counters as indicated in the rules. The
Naboo player choses which of the 2 **Queens** is the real one
and uses the marked counter face down on her track.

The TF player receives the **Go First** piece marker. Each
player draws 5 cards from each of their 2 decks for a total
of 10 cards.

## Round of Play

**Simultaneously, each player does the following:**
Choose any 4 cards and place facedown in the order to
be played, top to bottom.

```
Move any cards in their bonus pile under those 4 cards.
```
**Then beginning with the player with the Go First marker:**
Flip the first card and play it.

```
Players alternate playing cards until all are played.
```
**Move the Go First marker to the other player**

**Each player draws 2 new cards from** **_each_** **of their 2 decks**

## General Rules

**Playing cards**
If a card has more than one action, one must be chosen.
A group or character can move/attack only once per action.

**Movement
Characters/groups move, then attack.** They can only move
through or onto empty spaces.

**Attacking and defending**

After moving, characters/groups may attack any character/
group within range. Choose a target then roll dice as
indicated by the Reference Chart.

Some characters/groups may roll **defense dice** as indicated
on the Reference Chart. Each **block** rolled reduces the
number of hits by one.

Characters without damage tracks are removed after 1 hit.
Those with damage tracks record the number of hits they
take, and are removed once the counter reaches the **red
space**.

**Bonus cards**

Certain actions in the game give players **bonus cards**. They
can be chosen face down from the player’s **Battlefield** or
**Palace** decks. Bonus cards are played in the next round
after the player’s chosen 4 action cards, and are not looked
at until turned over at that time.

## Theed Palace Battle

```
All characters, excluding the Jedi and the Sith , have a
movement of 4 spaces in the palace. If the real Queen is
killed, all Palace Guards movement is reduced to 2.
```
```
Window ledge movement
When a window ledge movement card is played, the Naboo
player may move characters from a space in front of a
window to an empty space above or below it (and continue
movement). Moving both floors counts as one space. If the
destination window hex is blocked the move is blocked.
The card may also be used to move/attack with some or all
of the characters normally.
```
```
Line of sight
All characters have a combat range of line of sight (LOS).
Draw a line between the centre of both hexes; LOS is
blocked if a figure or obstruction obstructs this line. If it
runs along the edge of a hex, LOS is blocked only if hexes
on both sides of the line at any point contain obstructions.
```
```
Special spaces
Doors: the throne room and generator core doors block LOS
(but not movement). Characters can only attack if they are
on adjacent spaces on either side of a door.
```
```
Staircases: moving from one floor to another costs one
movement point. Characters on a staircase may attack
those on the space above or below.
```
```
Staging Zone: when the TF plays cards that allow troops to
move from the battlefield to the palace, they can be placed
only on these light first floor spaces. They may not move/
attack that turn. Spaces may be blocked by Naboo figures,
in which cases figures that cannot be placed are lost.
```
```
Viceroys: these two characters cannot move, be moved
through, attack or be attacked, but block LOS.
```
## Generator Core Battle

```
Movement/Combat
The Jedi and Sith may split their movement and combat
during their turn. After declaring an attack you declare how
many of your combat dice you are rolling. The defender
rolls his full damage dice for each attack.
```
```
The Jedi and Sith may only attack characters adjacent to
them.
```
```
If playing the special attack twice card, the most a
character can roll in one attack is 3 dice.
```
```
The Jedi/Sith roll defense dice even when an attack
misses. When the green defense die comes up a hit
symbol , they score a hit in defense (no matter the range).
No defense dice are rolled by the attacker for this hit.
```
```
Leaving the generator area
Neither side may leave the area until the other side is
killed. The area is off-limits to all other pieces.
```

## Planes of Naboo Battle

You cannot combine or separate groups on the battlefield.
The half spaces on the board cannot be occupied, moved
or fired through.

**Range**
A group/character with a range of 2 may attack a target 2
spaces away, however the first space must be empty.

**Catapults** may fire through occupied spaces.

**The shield**

Groups may only attack other groups that are on the same
side of the shield.

If the shield passes through a hex, groups on these spaces
may be attacked by, or attack, groups on either side. **AATs**
and **MTTs** cannot move into these spaces while the shield
is up.

If either of the **Fambaas** are killed, the shield goes down
and all units may move and fire through the shield area.

**Droids**

If droids are moved to the palace from the battlefield (via
an action card) they must be taken from the same group.

If more droids are deployed (via an action card) they are
taken from previously destroyed stocks (only if available)
and placed in any open hex adjacent to a Multi Troop
Transport. If all the MTTs are destroyed no new droids may
be deployed.

**Bonus cards**

Players receive one **bonus card** every time a hex is cleared
of enemies.

## Droid Control Ship Battle

Anakin’s Naboo fighter must navigate through an empty
slot on each grid to reach the next Anakin space.

When he reaches the final space remove all the droids from
the game, leaving only Darth Maul and the 2 viceroys on
the TF side.

**Movement**
When Anakin attempts to move, the TF player rolls the
number of gray dice indicated on the grid or **Starfighter**
card. Any dice that hit can be placed on any empty slots on
the grid, blocking them.

The Naboo player then rolls the 2 normal dice and adds
the numbers to see which slot Anakin has passed through.
If blocked, he cannot move. If empty, he moves through to
the next space. **Either way, Anakin’s turn ends.**

**Starfighter cards**

The TF player may draw and deploy **Starfighter** cards (via
an action card) faceup on top of an existing grid. Any
number of cards may be played on one grid.

If Anakin moves through a card grid, that card is removed
and Anakin may try again on the grid or card beneath it.
This continues until he makes it through to the next space
_(ie._ has cleared all the cards and moved through the grid)
or he is blocked.

Once used, Starfighter cards are discarded and not used
again.

## Winnng the Game

```
Naboo forces
The Naboo player wins when he shuts down the droids
by destroying the Trade Federation Control Ship and has
a majority in the palace throne room (minimum of 3
characters).
```
```
Trade Federation
The Trade Federation player wins when he destroys all but
2 of the Naboo pieces in the palace.
```
