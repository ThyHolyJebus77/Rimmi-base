# The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies - Rules

#### SETUP

One player is the Free Peoples player (FP); the other is the
Shadow player (SP). Both players take all their unit and
character figures, the corresponding cards, and their leadership
tokens.

Separate the FP Dwarves and Men, FP Elves and SP recruitment
tokens and shuffle them facedown into 3 piles.

Place starting figures and recruitment tokens as shown on
the map on page 7 of the rules. Draw the recruitment tokens
randomly from the appropriate piles and place them without
looking at them. Place the 2 closed mountain pass markers
between each Goblin Mustering Point and the corresponding
Mountain Pass box.

Shuffle the Event deck, the 2 Story decks and the Fate deck.

Place the Fate marker on step 0 of the Fate track. Place the
Bilbo, Thorin, Lord of the Eagles and Beorn figures on the steps
indicated.

Place the standard Fate tiles (light brown) in an opaque
container to form the Fate pool. Set aside the 2 special Fate tiles
(blue and red).

The SP takes 6 red Shadow action dice and the FP takes 5 blue
Free Peoples action dice.

#### THE GAME BOARD

Most of the board is divided into regions. Each has an icon
indicating its terrain type (hills, mountains, plains, ruins, and
swamps) and territory (Broken Lands: yellow, Valley: red,
Eastern Bank: blue, and Southern Spur: green).

Regions are divided by borders indicated by a white line.
Regions separated by a white line are adjacent. Borders can
also be outlined by the river, fords and slopes.

A river border is impassable, and regions separated by it are not
adjacent. Combat across a river border is not allowed.

A ford means the river border can be crossed and the regions on
its two ends are adjacent.

A slope divides a mountain region and any non-mountain region.

A black line is an impassable border: armies cannot move into
regions encircled by a black line or attack across black lines.

A region, independently of its terrain type, may contain a
settlement.

Eastern Spur, Front Gate and Ravenhill each contain a
fortification (light brown triangle with a number).

The Broken Lands contain 4 Mustering regions (red diamond
with a crown). There is no limit to the number of SP units each
of these regions can hold.

The special areas within the Lonely Mountain (each consisting
of 2 red boxes) are not considered regions for movement or
combat purposes. Each first box (Goblin Mustering Point)
is where new Goblin units are recruited. Goblins must move
through the second box (Mountain Pass) to join the battle.

#### THE GAME TURN

#### 1. RECOVERY

```
Players recover action dice and draw cards.
The FP player takes 5 dice (6 dice if either Thorin or Beorn is in
play). The SP takes 6 dice (7 dice if they control 2 settlements
or fortifications within the same territory).
```
```
Then each player draws 2 cards, one from the Event deck and
one from their Story deck. Players may hold a maximum of 6
cards and after drawing must discard facedown any in excess.
```
#### 2. GENERALS’ ACTIVATION

```
The FP selects their generals and places leadership tokens.
The FP player chooses up to 3 generals among those in play and
places 1 Activation token on each of their reference cards.
```
```
They then take leadership tokens equal to the number of
generals they chose and immediately places them on the board,
each with a different FP army.
```
#### 3. FATE

```
The SP draws Fate tiles and the Fate marker advances.
```
```
The SP may draw Fate tiles, one after the other, up to the
number of Activation tokens placed by the FP player (minimum
1).
```
```
After drawing each tile, the SP either stops drawing and applies
the effects of the last drawn tile, or sets aside the tile and pulls
another from the Fate pool (up to the maximum allowed).
```
```
When drawing is done, advance the Fate marker to the right on
the Fate track as many steps as the number on the last drawn
Fate tile. If the tile shows the Fate icon, the FP player draws a
Fate card and immediately applies its effects. It is discarded
after use. All other tiles drawn this turn are placed back in the
Fate pool.
```
```
If the Fate marker reaches the last step of the Fate track, the
FP player immediately wins the game.
```
#### 4. SHADOW LEADERSHIP

```
The SP places leadership tokens and Great Bats.
```
```
The SP chooses how many leadership tokens and/or Great Bats
they will have available this turn. The total sum must be equal to
the number of SP action dice (6 or 7).
```
```
They then place their leadership tokens and Great Bats on the
board. Each token must be placed with a different SP army.
Great Bats may be placed in any region, thus indicating their
presence in the territory containing that region.
```
#### 5. ACTION ROUND

```
Players roll action dice, then alternate taking actions.
```
```
Starting with the FP player, players choose one of their rolled
action dice and use one of the possible choices allowed.
```
```
The FP player may use the General ability of one of their
activated generals before each of their actions.
```
```
When both players have used all their action dice, proceed to
the next phase.
```
#### 6. END OF TURN

```
Players check victory conditions and remove leadership
tokens, Eagles and Great Bats.
```
```
Remove both players’ leadership tokens and any Great Bats
from the board. Eagle figures go back to the Eagles’ Eyrie.
Removed unused Activation tokens from the FP generals.
```
#### ACTION DICE

```
The total number of action dice you roll in your turn is your
action dice pool.
```
```
One additional die can be earned by each player during the
game. The FP player earns their extra die if Thorin Oakenshield
(or later Beorn) is in play. The SP earns theirs if they control 2
settlements or fortifications within the same territory.
```
```
Action dice are only added to or removed from a pool at the
beginning of the turn after the requirement which adds and
removes them is met.
```
```
When an action is completed, set aside the corresponding die
for the turn. The effect of an action is never mandatory (eg, if an
action allows you to ‘move 1 army and attack’, you may move
only, attack only, or do both).
You may pass your action if your opponent has more unused
action dice. You may skip an action by discarding a die without
effect.
```
#### EVENT AND STORY CARDS

```
Both players draw from a shared Event deck, and each player
has their own Story deck.
```
```
Each Event card has an order effect, triggered using an action
die during the Action round, or a combat effect, applied during
a combat. Story cards can only be played using an action die
during the Action round.
```
```
If the Event deck runs out, shuffle all used and discarded Event
cards into a new deck. If a Story deck runs out, no more cards
may be drawn from that deck.
```
```
A card can be played during the Action round by using an Event
action die result, or by using an action die result matching the
card type: Army, Character or Muster (the icon in the upper
right corner).
Some cards have a requirement that must be fully satisfied in
order to play the card. If the effects of a card cannot be fully
applied it can still be played and the effects applied as much as
possible. Most cards are discarded once resolved.
```
```
Play on the table means the card’s effects last until a condition
or requirement is met, after which the card is discarded. They
do not count against the maximum hand size while in play.
```
```
Damage dealt by Event cards is applied in the same way as
combat damage.
```
#### FATE

```
The SP may continue to draw tiles up to the number of generals
with an Activation icon. The SP must always apply the effects of
the last drawn fate tile. Then that tile is discarded and any tile
previously drawn that turn is placed back into the Fate pool.
```
```
If the SP draws a red or blue special tile, they must stop drawing
and immediately apply its effects.
The number on the Fate tile is the number of spaces the fate
marker moves to the right on the Fate track.
When the Fate marker reaches or passes the space of a special
character, the character is ready and may be played during the
Action round as indicated on its card.
```
```
A Fate icon on the Fate tile means the FP player draws and
immediately plays a Fate card. Place the card next to the
appropriate character card whether it has entered play or not. If
the character has been eliminated, discard the drawn card.
```
#### CHARACTERS AND GENERALS

#### CHARACTERS

```
Characters can be on the board alone (or with other characters)
in a region, or moving and fighting with a friendly army.
A character not with an army ignores, and is ignored by, enemy
armies.
A character/special unit card starts illustration faceup, and is
flipped when the character/special unit enters play. Characters
must become ready before entering play.
```
```
FP characters become ready when they Fate maker reaches or
passes their space on the Fate track.
```
```
The SP character Bolg becomes ready when the SP controls at
least 1 region in the Valley.
```
```
A ready character can enter play during the Action round by
using an action die of the type specified on its card. Other
requirements may be specified. A character cannot enter play
in a specific region if that region contains enemy units or is
controlled by the enemy. A character may become not ready
again if the condition for being ready is no longer met and the
character has not yet been brought into play.
```
```
When using a Character Movement action, you may move any
or all of your characters on the board, each up to a number of
regions equal to its movement rating.
```
```
A character within an army may move when that army moves, or
be left behind in the army’s starting region.
```
#### GENERALS

```
Bard, Thranduil, Gandalf the Grey, Dáin Ironfoot and The Lord of
the Eagles are FP generals.
```
```
Each general has a special ability that can be used only when
they have an Activation token on their card. Discard the token
during the Action round, before choosing action die results,
to use the ability. You may only discard 1 token before using a
given die. Unused tokens are discarded at the end of the turn.
```
```
Thranduil and Gandalf the Grey use the range ruler: place one
end entirely in the region where the attack comes from, and if
the target region is touched by the opposite end, or falls within
its arc, it is within range. You cannot attack from one region to
another crossing the black borders on the Lonely Mountain.
The damage from Thranduil’s Archery and Gandalf’s Blast of
Magic is applied in the same way as combat damage.
```
#### ARMIES

```
A group of friendly units in the same region is an army. Each unit
type is described by a specific Unit card.
```
```
Characters and leadership tokens in a region with a friendly army
are part of it.
The number of figures in the game is a limited to the maximum
number of figures of that type that can be in play.
A region can contain a maximum of 5 army units (characters,
leadership tokens and special units do not count, and SP
Mustering regions and Goblin Mustering Points have no limit).
```
```
The Leadership of an army is the sum of the Leadership rating
of all its characters, plus the number of leadership tokens with
the army. An army with a least 1 character with a Leadership
of 1 or more, or at least 1 leadership token, is an ‘Army with
Leadership’.
A leadership token is immediately removed if it ever remains in a
region without an army.
```

#### ARMY MOVEMENT

An army can be moved to an adjacent region not occupied by an
enemy army with the following action die results:

```
Army: An army may make a Strategic Movement action (up to
2 different armies to an adjacent region), or an Attack action
(move 1 army to an adjacent region and then attack).
```
```
Character: An army with Leadership may make an Attack
action (move 1 army to an adjacent region and then attack) or
a Fast Movement action (1 army up to 2 regions).
```
```
Lidless Eye: An army with at least 1 Goblin unit may make
a Strategic Movement action (up to 2 different armies
containing Goblins to an adjacent region or from a Mustering
Point to a Mountain Pass), or an Attack action (move 1 army
containing Goblins to an adjacent region or from a Mustering
Point to a Mountain Pass and then attack).
```
Movement is never mandatory. An army may be moved more
than once in a turn by spending multiple action dice.

Splitting and merging
An army may be split into 2 by moving only some of the units.
With a Strategic Movement action, each part may move to a
different region, or it may be split into 3 parts, with 2 moving
and 1 staying behind.

If an army with damage tokens is split, the tokens must be split
so the number remaining is not higher than the number of units
in each part.

If an army ends its movement in a region containing a friendly
army, they must merge into a single army. If necessary reduce
it to 5 units: the controlling player first removes up to 2 damage
tokens for each unit eliminated, then removes any remaining
units of their choice in excess of 5. During an Attack, the armies
merge before combat; during a Strategic Movement, both
armies complete their moves before merging (no figure may
move twice in the same action).

If an army moves more than 1 region, it cannot split units during
the move, and cannot merge along the way or pick up friendly
units. Stacking limits are checked only all the movements are
complete. If the army enters a region adjacent to an enemy
army it must immediately stop moving.

Controlling Free Peoples settlements
When a SP army enters a region with a FP settlement/
fortification (even if it does not stop there), it controls it: place
a control marker there. The marker is removed if a FP army unit
(not a character or Eagles) later moves into the settlement.

Moving into an enemy settlement is not considered an attack,
even if it is controlled by the enemy.

#### MUSTERING ARMIES

Both players may bring new units into play by using the
Recruitment action of a Muster die to flip 1 recruitment token
in each of 2 different regions. The SP may use the Goblins
Recruitment action of a Lidless Eye die to place 1 Goblin in each
of the 2 Goblin Mustering Point boxes.

Special abilities and cards may bring units directly into play.

The back of a recruitment token identifies it as Shadow,
Dwarves and Men, or Elves, and the front what type of unit(s) it
brings into play when flipped. They are always drawn randomly
from the appropriate group and placed facedown (and unseen
by both players) on the board.

Once all from a group have been used, no more from that group
can be placed. Tokens can never be placed in a region with an
enemy army or control marker.

```
When you flip a token, choose a region with a token of the
appropriate type and turn it faceup. Replace it with unit(s) of the
appropriate type (if a figure of that type is not available, you may
choose any other unit from the same group) and remove the
token from the game.
If, during a movement or after a combat, an army enters or
moves through a region with enemy recruitment tokens, the
tokens are removed and reshuffled with the unused tokens of
the same type.
If there are more than 5 army units in a region after recruitment,
the controlling player must choose those in excess to remove.
Mustering regions have no stacking limit.
```
#### RALLYING ARMIES

```
You may rally up to 2 different friendly armies with a Rally action
of a Muster die.
```
```
For each army, roll dice equal to the number of units in it: on
each 5 or 6, remove 1 damage token. You may roll again a
number of failed dice up to the total Leadership of the army.
After the roll, you may also take casualties if you desire.
```
#### MOUNTAIN PASSES

```
At the beginning of the game the Mountain Passes are closed,
as indicated by the markers between each Mustering Point and
the corresponding Mountain Pass.
```
```
A Mountain Pass opens as soon as the connected Mustering
Point contains at least 5 units. Remove the marker: the pass
remains open for the rest of the game.
```
```
The SP army may only move from the Mustering Point to the
Mountain Pass when it is open (using normal army movement).
It may then move only to the region connected to the Mountain
Pass; and may attack a FP army as normal if a FP army is there.
The attack is not considered to cross a slope border.
```
```
SP armies in the Mountain Pass and a normal region cannot
combine attacks. Units in any region cannot enter, retreat into,
or attack units in a Mountain Pass, and it is not considered
adjacent to a region.
```
```
Event cards that allow recruitment in regions containing armies
may be used in Goblin Mustering Point and Mountain Passes.
```
#### COMBAT

```
An army may attack an adjacent region occupied by an enemy
army by using the Attack action of an Army die after moving
their army; by using the Combined Attack action of an Army die
and attacking a region with other friendly armies adjacent to
that region; or by using the Attack action of a Character die after
moving their army with Leadership.
```
```
A SP army with at least 1 Goblin unit may also use the Attack
action of a Lidless Eye die after moving their army.
```
```
The army of the active player is the attacker, and the army of
the other player is the defender.
```
```
Before starting a combat, check the terrain type of the
defender’s region. The army with the highest number of units
that have that type as one of their favored terrains has terrain
superiority and immediately draws 1 Event card and adds it to
their hand (discard to 6 if necessary). On a tie neither player
draws a card.
```
```
Each player then prepares their card hand by setting aside any
Story cards, and adding to their hand the Unit cards of each
unit type in their army, their Regroup card, and any Special
Maneuver cards if applicable (from Thorin Oakenshield and
Great Bats). These cards do not count against the hand limit.
```
#### COMBAT SEQUENCE

```
Combats are resolved in a series of simultaneous rounds, each
of which is divided into the following steps:
```
1. Maneuvering
Players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their
hand. You may either play a Unit card (to use that unit type’s
maneuver ability), an Event card (to use its combat effect), a
Special Maneuver card, or the Regroup card.

```
The combat effect of an Event card is applied when specified by
the text. If 2 cards apply at the same time, apply the defender’s
first. Event cards are discarded from play after use.
```
```
Special Maneuver cards are applied immediately, independent
of the dice roll. Thorin’s Mighty Strokes is not available again
until a Regroup card is played. Vampire-like can be used every
round there are Great Bats in the territory where the combat
takes place.
Unit cards are left faceup on the table. When a Regroup card
is played, return all Unit and Special Maneuver cards you have
played this combat to your hand.
```
2. The combat roll
Each player rolls dice equal to the sum of the Combat ratings of
all the units in their army, up to a maximum of 5 dice.

```
If you played a Unit card during the previous step, first
substitute a number of white dice with black dice equal to the
number of units of the selected type.
After the Combat roll and Leader re-roll, if at least 1 of the black
dice scored a hit, you may use the special ability of that unit
type. If necessary the attacker declares first if they want to use
a maneuver ability.
```
```
Any hits rolled on white or black dice are applied normally. A hit
is scored for each result that equals or beats a target number
(usually 5). Other target numbers are as follows:
```
```
Attacking a defender in a fortification: 6 until the fortification
is broken.
Attacking a defender across a ford: 6 on the first round only.
Attacking a defender in a mountains region across a slope: 6 on
the first round only.
Cards and special abilities may modify the target number. A
card that adds or subtracts from a Combat roll modifies each
die result produced by the roll. No modification may lower the
target number below 2 or increase it to above 6.
```
3. Leader re-roll
An army with Leadership may re-roll a number of dice that
missed equal to the army’s total Leadership (white or black
dice). The new result is final.
4. Apply damage
Add a damage token to an army for each hit on it. Event cards
and abilities that affect damage are determined after taking
damage tokens and before taking casualties.
When taking casualties, for each unit you choose to eliminate
from your army, you may remove up to 2 damage tokens.
Eliminated units may be mustered again.

```
When the number of damage tokens on a army exceeds its
number of units, you must take casualties and remove units
(remove 2 damage tokens for each unit removed) until the
number of tokens is equal to or lower than the number of units.
If all units in an army are eliminated, so are all characters
and leadership tokens in the army. Eliminated characters are
permanently out of the game.
```
5. End of round
The combat ends if either side is eliminated. After the round, if
the attacker declares wants to withdraw, the combat ends.

```
If they do not, the defender may retreat (if they played a Regroup
card this round) or rout (if they did not play a Regroup card).
```
```
If the defender is eliminated, retreats, or routs, the attacker
may advance. If both sides are eliminated, the defender retains
control of the contested region.
```
#### FORTIFICATIONS

```
Eastern Spur, Front Gate and Ravenhill are fortifications. If a
defending army is attacked while within a fortification, damage
to it is applied to the fortification until the damage tokens reach
its fortification value and it is broken.
Further damage is inflicted on the defender and the target
number reverts to 5 on the following round. Damage to a
fortification is permanent.
```
```
When an ability cancels or prevents damage, it may be used to
cancel or prevent fortification damage.
```
#### RETREATING & ROUTING

```
An army retreats when the defender played the Regroup card
and decides to end the combat at the end of a round.
```
```
A defending army may move to an adjacent region if the region
does not contain an enemy army or an enemy-controlled
settlement; if it is not adjacent to a region with an enemy army
(including the attacker); and if the region is not across a ford. It
may always retreat to an adjacent region if that region contains
a friendly army, or a settlement controlled by the retreating
player.
If these conditions cannot be satisfied, the attacker chooses an
adjacent region (which does not contain one of the attacker’s
armies or attacker-controlled settlements) and the retreating
army suffers 1 additional damage. If there is no viable region,
the retreat is not allowed.
```
```
An army routs when the defender did not play the Regroup card
and decides to end the combat at the end of a round.
```
```
The army takes casualties and loses units until the number
of damage counters is reduced to 1 or 0. It then moves to an
adjacent region in the same way as a retreating army.
```
```
An attacker may advance into the now-empty region if a
defender retreats, routs or is eliminated. They may split their
army and advance with only some units (if necessary, splitting
damage tokens as normal).
```
#### COMBINED ATTACKS

```
More than 1 army adjacent to the attacked region may combine
attacks by using the Combined Attack action of an Army
die. At the start of each round the attacker chooses which
adjacent army will fight in the current round. Only that army’s
characteristics are relevant, and all hits scored by the defender
are taken by that army.
```
```
Terrain superiority is checked only once before the first combat
round and the target number of each army is affected by a
ford or slope only the first time it attacks. The attacker always
recovers any used Unit and Special Maneuver card when they
switch the attack to a different army.
After a victorious combined attack, the attacker may advance
only one (or part of one) army. If the last attacking army is
eliminated and the defender is eliminated, retreats, or routs, the
combat is still won by the attacker if an army survives and one of
the attacking armies my advance.
```

#### THE LORD OF THE EAGLES &

#### THE EAGLES OF THE MISTY

#### MOUNTAINS

The Lord of the Eagles is not a normal
character and the Eagles of the Misty
Mountains are not normal army units,
and neither follow the normal rules.

Mustering the Eagles
Eagles cannot be recruited with a normal
action; they are only mustered by specific
cards or using the Lord of the Eagles
General ability (instead of using his ability
to move them).

When mustered, they are always placed in
the Eagles’ Eyrie box. Eagles placed there
due to a Story or Event card cannot be
used until they enter play.

Movement
At the start of a turn, Eagles are always in
the Eyrie. If the Lord’s General ability is
used, all Eagles (including the Lord) are
moved anywhere on the board.

Eagles are moved back to the Eyrie when
they are used, and always moved back
there at the end of a turn when unused.

Using the Eagles
Eagles enter play when the Lord enters.

Once moved out of the Eyrie using the
Lord’s General ability, the FP player can
then spend a Muster die to activate their
Strong and Noble-Hearted ability, and
move 1 or more of them (including the
Lord) from the board to the Eyrie.

When every Eagle has thus moved, attack
1 SP army in a region within the territory
where the Eagle was.

All Eagles must be moved before any
attacks are rolled.

Roll 3 dice for each attack, scoring a hit
for each 4+.

Any die that misses may be re-rolled once.
The attack roll cannot be modified in any
other way.

#### BEORN

```
Beorn grants an immediate victory to the
FP player if he enters play and the SP has
fewer than 6 VPs.
```
```
Beorn enters play with 8 Wrath tokens, and
may gain additional tokens using Fate cards
(up to a maximum of 16).
```
```
Movement
Beorn can move up to 3 regions using a Will
of the West die, or by using a Character die
if the FP player also discards 1 of his Wrath
tokens (other FP characters are not moved
at the same time).
```
```
After moving, Beorn may attack a SP
army in an adjacent region. He may
also recapture an empty SP-controlled
settlement by moving through it.
```
```
Beorn can never be stacked with army units
and is unaffected by the presence of FP
characters without an army.
```
```
Beorn cannot move into or through a region
containing a SP army. He is equivalent to
a FP army for the purposes of moving SP
armies.
```
```
Combat
Beorn can attack and be attacked by SP
armies in adjacent regions.
```
```
Terrain superiority is not checked or applied
and he does not use Event or Maneuver
cards in combat. He suffers the normal
penalties when attacking a fortification,
across a ford, or up a slope.
```
```
Roll 4 dice for each attack, scoring a hit
for each 5+. Any die that misses may be
re-rolled once. Fate cards may modify
these values.
When Beorn takes damage, remove an
equal number of Wrath tokens instead of
damage tokens. If reduced to 0 tokens,
remove him from play.
```
```
He can retreat like an army, but cannot
retreat into a region with a friendly army.
Beorn cannot be rallied, is not affected by
the Wargs maneuver ability, and cannot
participate in a combined attack.
```
#### GREAT BATS

```
The Great Bats are not a normal army
units, and do not follow the normal rules.
```
```
During the SP Leadership phase the SP
chooses how many Great Bats are in play
(maximum of 6), as long as the total sum
is equal to the number of SP action dice.
These are placed on the board and affect
the territory they are in, not the specific
region. Great Bats can be used as follows:
```
```
Bat Cloud: During the action round the SP
may use a Muster die and remove 1 Great
Bat from a territory to move 1 of the SP’s
armies in that territory.
Vampire-like: If 1 or more Great Bats are
in the territory where a combat takes place
(ie, where the defender army is), the SP
adds the Vampire-like Special Maneuver
card to their hand and may play it as their
maneuver during a round. If they do so
and the SP army inflicts at least 1 damage
that round, the SP can discard 1 Great
Bat from the territory to inflict 1 additional
damage. Take the card back at the end of
the combat round. The card has no effect if
there is no figure to discard.
```
```
Any unused Great Bat figure is removed
from play at the end of the turn.
```
#### BOLG

```
Bolg is the leader of the SP army and
enters play only when a SP army is present
in at least 1 region in Valley.
```
```
He is stronger if he enters when the SP
army controls Ruins of Dale, as he starts
with 3 Bodyguard tokens instead of 1.
```
```
Bolg is the only SP character. If he is killed
the FP player immediately wins the game.
He is eliminated when the army he is with
is eliminated. He cannot attack or be
attacked when he is alone.
```
```
Bodyguards: Bolg may cancel all damage
inflicted in 1 round of combat to the army
he is with by discarding 1 Bodyguard
token. This can also protect the army from
damage not caused by combat (eg, from
special abilities).
```
#### THE FP PLAYER WINS ...

... immediately as soon as one of these
conditions applies:

```
Bolg is eliminated.
Beorn enters play and the SP has fewer
than 6 VPs.
The Fate track marker reaches step 15.
```
#### THE SP PLAYER WINS ...

```
... if the SP has 10 or more VPs at the end
of a turn, or immediately if the SP has 10
VPs and controls Front Gate.
Control of these locations gives the SP
victory points:
```
```
Fortifications (Ravenhill, Front Gate and
Eastern Spur) are worth 4 VPs each.
Other Settlements (Ruins of Dale, Camp,
Lower Slopes and Fallen Bridge) are worth
2 VPs each.
