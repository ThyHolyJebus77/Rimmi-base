# Arkham Horror - Rules
###### Setup

Set up the Arkham board and place a **clue** token at each
**red diamond** location.

Set the **Terror Track** to 0. Shuffle the **Gates**.

Each players chooses or randomly selects his **investigator**.
Take investigator **fixed possessions** and, after shuffling
all decks, **random possessions** (abilities affecting random
draws can be used).

Set investigator **skill** sliders to any positions and take
**sanity** and **stamina** tokens equal to starting scores.

Place **investigator markers** at home locations.

Select an **Ancient One** randomly or choose one.

Place the **monsters** in an opaque cup. Set aside _Mask_
monsters unless facing _Nyarlathotep_.

A random player takes the first player marker, then draws
and resolves a **Mythos** card ( _Rumor_ cards and cards with
no Gate are discarded, draw again). Remember to place a
**Doom** counter on the Ancient One’s track.

With 5+ players, place 2 monsters on the Gate instead
of one.

**Each phase is played by all players** , going clockwise starting
with the _first player_. Pass the FP marker on at turn end.

###### 1. Upkeep

If _Lost in Time and Space_ and not _delayed_ , return to
anywhere in Arkham.

###### 1. Refresh Exhausted Cards (rotate them upright).

###### 2. Perform Upkeep Actions of all cards ( Bless , Curse ,

_Bank Loan_ and _Retainer_ cards do not require an
Upkeep roll on the _first_ phase after being acquired).

###### 3. Adjust Skills a number of stops up to Focus.

###### 2. Movement

If _delayed_ , stand up marker and your movement ends.
If in the **Jail Cell** , move to the main **Police Station** area.

Otherwise take one of the following actions depending on
location:

###### a. Arkham Movement

Receive movement points equal to **Speed**. May spend 1
movement point to move from one board area to another
connected by a yellow line.

**You must evade or fight** **_each_** **monster there when leaving
an area, ending movement in an area, or remaining in an
area without moving.**

**Combat** ends movement. Movement always ends once
combat with a monster begins.

Remove any **Explored** marker if leaving a location.

**Clues** may only be taken from a location where a player
_ends_ movement.

###### b. Other World Movement

```
Each Other World space is divided into 2 areas.
An investigator receives no movement points there.
Left Area: move investigator to the right area.
Right Area: return to Arkham; move to a corresponding
Gate and place an Explored marker under the investigator,
who does not have to fight or evade any monsters there
that turn only. If there is no corresponding Gate, the
investigator is Lost in Time and Space.
```
###### 3. Arkham Encounters

###### 1. No Gate

```
Resolve special ability of location OR
```
```
Shuffle the corresponding location deck, draw a card and
apply the appropriate entry.
Monsters and Gates cannot appear at sealed locations.
If a monster appears and there is no Gate , it must be
evaded or fought. Monsters that appear are taken as
trophies if defeated, but returned to the cup if evaded.
```
```
If a Gate appears , investigators there immediately move
to the corresponding Other World and are delayed. Add a
Doom token to the Doom track ; any monster that appears
stays on the board.
```
###### 2. Gate

```
The investigator is drawn through the Gate to the left area
of the corresponding Other World. If he was on an Explored
marker, he is not drawn through and may instead:
```
```
Close (& Seal) a Gate:
Make a Lore or Fight check with the modifier on the
Gate. There is no effect on a fail (he may try again on
subsequent turns if he does not leave the location).
```
```
Pass: Take the Gate marker as a trophy. All monsters with
the Gate’s dimension symbol in Arkham, the Sky and the
Outskirts are returned to the cup.
```
```
Then Seal : Immediately spend 5 Clues
to place an unused Doom token on the
location as an elder sign.
```
```
Elder Sign Unique Item: No roll or Clues required; return
the elder sign card to the box and take the Gate as a trophy.
All monsters with the Gate’s dimension symbol in Arkham,
the Sky and the Outskirts are returned to the cup. Take a
Doom token from the Doom track, flip it and place it as an
elder sign on the gate. Lose 1 Sanity and 1 Stamina.
```
###### 4. Other World Encounters

###### 1. Draw Gate Cards

```
Until the card color (or either color for dual-color cards)
matches an encounter symbol on the Other World space.
```
###### 2. Perform Encounter Entry for Location

```
If no location matches use the Other entry. Monsters
that appear must be evaded or fought; they are taken as
trophies if defeated, but returned to the cup if evaded.
```
###### 5. Mythos

##### The First Player (only) draws a Mythos card:

###### 1. Open Gate and Spawn Monster (lower left)

```
No Elder Sign / Open Gate at Location:
Add a Doom token to the Doom track.
Draw a random Gate and place it faceup
on the location. Discard any Clue tokens
there. Investigators there are immediately
moved to the corresponding Other World and delayed.
Monsters are never drawn through Gates.
Draw a monster and place it at the location (5+ players,
place 2 monsters). If this brings the total number
of monsters over the monster limit, place it in the
Outskirts.
```
```
Open Gate at Location:
Monster surge: a number of monsters (the number
of open Gates or the number of players, whichever is
greater) appear, divided evenly among all open Gates
(no Gate receives more monsters than the location
shown on the Mythos card). If there are more monsters
than the monster limit , players choose where monsters
will be placed before drawing; remaining monsters go
to the Outskirts.
```
```
Elder Sign at Location:
No Gate or monster.
```
###### 2. Place Clue Token (location in middle)

```
Only if there is no open Gate at that location.
If a player is there he may immediately take the Clue.
```
###### 3. Move Monsters (lower right)

```
Move monsters with a matching dimension symbol
along the arrow of the same color as the box around the
symbol (half white, half black arrows count as white
and black).
```
```
A monster does not move if a player is in its location,
and a monster stops when it encounters a player.
Monsters do not fight players in this phase.
```
```
If there is an equal choice between player targets,
target the player with the lowest Sneak skill.
```
```
Monster Movement Abilities
```
```
Black Normal.
Yellow Never moves.
```
```
Red Fast: Move twice.
```
```
Green Special: marker.
```
```
Blue Flying: Move to connected street area with
a player in it. Otherwise move to the Sky
(counts towards monster limit) and move
to any street location in Arkham next time.
Flyers will not leave a space containing a
player, and remain in the Sky if there are
no players in a street.
```
###### 4. Activate Mythos Ability (top):

```
Headline: Resolve then discard.
Environment: Place faceup near the board.
Discard any previous Environment cards.
Rumor: Applies if no Rumor card is in play.
Otherwise, ignore the mythos text. A Rumor card
and its markers in play is only discarded when its
Pass/Fail condition is met.
```
###### Skill Checks

##### Roll # of dice = ( skill value +/- modifier )

```
Skill difficulty is number of dice successes required to
pass the check (default difficulty is 1). If skill minus
modifier is 0 or less, the check is automatically failed.
```
```
Normal success: 5 or 6 ( cursed: 6, blessed: 4, 5 or 6).
```
```
After a skill check (pass or fail), a player may
always spend Clues one at a time. For each
Clue spent, roll an additional die. Each
success is added to the original total.
```
```
A Clue gives you the bonus dice even if modifiers have
dropped the number of dice below 0.
```
###### Evading Monsters

```
Evade Skill Check. Use Sneak skill with Sneak and Evade
Skill bonuses, modified by monster’s Awareness rating
(upper right).
```
```
Pass: continue as normal. Can move on or stay and
interact with the space in the Encounters phase.
Fail: Lose Stamina equal to icons, begin Combat.
```
```
If there is more than one monster in an area they must be
evaded, each in turn, in an order chosen by the player.
```
###### Monster Abilities

```
Ambush Once combat has begun the investigator cannot
flee.
```
```
Endless The monster cannot be collected as a monster
trophy. It is returned to the cup if defeated.
```
```
Nightmarish X If the investigator passes a Horror check
he still loses X sanity (does not apply if the Horror check
is failed).
```
```
Overwhelming X If the investigator defeats this monster he
still loses X Stamina (does not apply if the Combat check
is failed).
```
```
Physical/Magical Resistance Weapons, Spells and Magical
Effects providing Physical/Magical (as applicable) bonuses
provide half normal bonus (round up). Other abilities are
not affected.
```
```
Physical/Magical Immunity Weapons, Spells and Magical
Effects providing Physical/Magical (as applicable) bonuses
give no bonus. Other abilities are not affected.
```

###### Combat

If evasion is not attempted or fails, proceed to **combat**.

###### 1. Horror Check

There is only one **Horror Skill Check** per battle. Use **Will**
skill with _Will_ and _Horror_ Skill bonuses, modified by the
monster’s **Horror rating** _(lower left)._ The test difficulty is
always 1 unless noted otherwise.

```
Pass: nothing happens.
Fail: lose Sanity equal to icons.
```
###### 2. Choose Flee or Fight

**Flee: Evade Skill Check.**

```
Pass: battle ends.
Fail: monster deals combat damage, continue combat.
```
**Fight: Combat Skill Check.** Use **Fight** skill with _Fight_ and
_Combat_ Skill bonuses, modified by the monster’s **Combat
rating** _(lower right)._

Choose any combination of weapons/spells up to a total
of 2 **hand icons**. Bonuses only apply while the required
number of hands are devoted to the weapon/spell. You
may switch weapons between rounds, but the effects of
a successfully cast spell stop as soon as you remove that
spell from your hand.

**Test difficulty** is the number of **Toughness** icons. Partial
success has no effect.

```
Pass: Take the monster chit as a trophy.
Fail: Lose Stamina equal to icons.
Then return to the Choose Flee or Fight step.
```
###### Casting Spells

Pay **Sanity cost** of the spell and make a **Spell Skill Check**.

Use **Lore** skill with _Lore_ and _Spell_ Skill bonuses, modified
by the spell’s **casting modifier**.

If the check fails the spell has no effect (but still uses the
number of hand icons it requires).

Spells that are _refreshed_ (eg. each combat round in the
Final Battle) cease to work and must be re-cast.

###### Sanity and Stamina

An investigator can never exceed the maximum Sanity or
Stamina as listed on his investigator sheet.

###### If Sanity and/or Stamina are ever reduced to 0:

**Choose and discard half of the investigator’s items** (count
all Common Items, Unique Items, Exhibit Items, Spells,
Deputy’s Revolver and Patrol Wagon); half of his **Clues**
(round down); and all of his **Retainers**.

Restore Sanity and Stamina to minimum of 1.

**In Arkham:** If Sanity, go immediately to Arkham Asylum. If
Stamina, go to St. Mary’s Hospital. No encounters this turn.

**In Other World:** Player is _Lost in Time and Space_.

**If Sanity and Stamina are both reduced to 0, or either’s**
**_maximum_** **is reduced to 0, the investigator is** **_devoured_****.**

###### Investigator Status

```
Arrested Move the investigator to the Jail Cell area of the
Police Station
```
```
He loses half of his money (round down) and is delayed.
Next turn he may only stand his marker up in the Police
Station.
```
```
Blessed / Cursed An investigator can have only one at
a time. If a Blessed investigator is Cursed , discard the
Blessing and vice versa.
```
```
Delayed Place the investigator marker on its side; the
investigator may not move or receive movement points.
```
```
Devoured Discard all cards except unspent trophies.
Randomly draw a new investigator and set up anew.
```
```
Lost in Time and Space Move to Lost in Time and Space
area and be delayed. Next turn the investigator can only
stand up. On the following turn he may move to any
location or street area in Arkham.
```
###### Monster Limit and the Outskirts

```
The maximum number of monsters in Arkham (including
the Sky area) is the number of players +3 (unless the
terror level is at 10).
```
```
If adding a monster would bring the number of monsters
above the monster limit, place the monster in the Outskirts
area.
```
```
Once the number of monsters in the Outskirts exceeds 8
minus the number of players, return all monsters in the
Outskirts to the cup and increase the terror level by 1.
```
```
Continue adding drawn monsters to the Outskirts if
applicable.
```
###### Terror Track

```
For each point the terror level goes up, return to the box a
random unclaimed Ally card (if any left). Also:
```
```
If the terror level reaches 3 , close General Store.
Players and monsters inside move to Rivertown.
```
```
If the terror level reaches 6 , close the Curiositie
Shoppe. Players and monsters inside move to
Northside.
```
```
If the terror level reaches 9 , close the Magick Shoppe.
Players and monsters inside move to Uptown.
```
```
If the terror level reaches 10 , return all monsters in the
Outskirts to the cup. The monster limit is removed.
If the terror level increases again (eg. via a Mythos
card), instead add 1 Doom token to the Doom track for
each point it should have increased.
```
###### Ancient One Awakens!

```
When one of the following occurs the Ancient One awakes:
immediately go to the Final Battle:
```
```
Doom track is full
```
```
Too many Gates open:
1-2 players: 8 Gates 5-6 players: 6 Gates
3-4 players: 7 Gates 7-8 players: 5 Gates
```
```
A new Gate opens and there are no Gate markers left.
```
```
A monster should be drawn but there are no monsters
left in the cup, or a new gate would open but there are
no gate markers available.
```
```
The Terror level is 10 and the number of monsters in
Arkham is twice the normal monster limit.
```
```
Final Battle
First fill the Doom track with Doom tokens. All players Lost
in Time and Space are devoured and eliminated. Discard
any active Environment or Rumor cards.
```
```
Survivors must battle the Ancient One. Once the final
battle begins, players can no longer collect money, gain
Clue tokens, or roll for Retainers or Bank Loans.
```
```
Each combat round:
Upkeep Each player still alive may refresh cards, use
character abilities, adjust skill sliders and trade equipment
with other players. Pass the first player marker to the left.
```
```
Attack Each player still alive starting from the first player
may make a Combat Check against the Ancient One,
modified by its Combat rating.
```
```
The players must get a total number of successes equal
to the number of players (including eliminated players)
to remove a Doom token. Successes are carried over
to subsequent rounds, but reset to zero after removing
a Doom token. When the last Doom token is removed,
players win.
```
```
Ancient One Attacks The Ancient One attacks each
player in turn using the attack shown on its card. Any
player reduced to 0 Stamina or Sanity is eliminated. If all
investigators are eliminated, players lose. Otherwise, start
a new round.
```
###### Winning

```

board, and players have Gate trophies (including the Gate
just closed, but not including trophies spent) equal to or
greater than the number of players.

(train icon) location to another (including the **Train Station** ).
Investigators can _never_ enter a **vortex**.

No direct move is allowed into the **Kingsport Head** locations
using spells, equipment, or unusual methods such as returning
from _Lost in Time and Space._ Investigators entering the
**Causeway** or **Wireless Station** must end their movement.

##### b. Other World Movement

Each **Other World** space is divided into 2 areas.
An investigator receives no movement points there.

**Left Area:**
Move investigator to the right area.

**Right Area:**
Return to Arkham; move to a corresponding Gate and place an
**Explored** marker under the investigator, who does not have to
fight or evade any monsters there _that turn only_. If there is no
corresponding Gate, the investigator is _Lost in Time and Space_.

###### 3. Arkham Encounters

##### 1. No Gate

```
Resolve special ability of location OR
Shuffle the corresponding location deck, draw a card and apply
the appropriate entry.
If a location encounter mentions a person by name who
appears on a Blight card in play, ignore the encounter and
instead lose 1 Sanity or 1 Stamina (player’s choice).
```
```
Monsters and Gates cannot appear at sealed locations.
If a monster appears and there is no Gate , it must be evaded or
fought. Monsters that appear are taken as trophies if defeated,
but returned to the cup if evaded.
```
```
If a Gate appears , investigators there immediately move to the
corresponding Other World and are delayed. Add a Doom token
to the Doom track ; any monster that appears stays on the board.
```
```
After a Kingsport encounter, either discard one rift progress
marker showing that location (if the corresponding rift is
closed ) or turn one facedown (if the corresponding rift is
open ).
```
```
Once all 4 progress markers are turned facedown they are
discarded and the rift marker is returned to its rift track.
```
##### 2. Gate

```
The investigator is drawn through the Gate to the left area
of the corresponding Other World. If he was on an Explored
marker, he is not drawn through and may instead:
```
###### Close (& Seal) a Gate:

```
Make a Lore or Fight check with the modifier on the Gate.
There is no effect on a fail (he may try again on subsequent
turns if he does not leave the location).
Pass: Take the Gate marker as a trophy. All monsters with
the Gate’s dimension symbol in Arkham, the Sky and the
Outskirts are returned to the cup.
```
```
Corruption cards with a matching dimension symbol are
removed from the game.
```
```
Then Seal : Immediately spend 5 Clues to
place an unused Doom token on the location
as an elder sign.
```
```
Sealing a Gate with an Elder Sign Unique Item
No roll or Clues are required. Return the elder sign card to the
box and take the Gate as a trophy. All monsters with the Gate’s
dimension symbol in Arkham, the Sky and the Outskirts are
returned to the cup. Take a Doom token from the Doom track
and place it as an elder sign on the gate. Lose 1 Sanity and
1 Stamina.
```
###### 4. Other World Encounters

##### 1. Draw Gate Cards

```
Until the card color (or either color for dual-color cards)
matches an encounter symbol on the Other World space.
```
##### 2. Perform Encounter Entry for Location

```
If no location matches use the Other entry.
Monsters that appear must be evaded or fought; they are taken
as trophies if defeated, but returned to the cup if evaded.
```
###### 5. Mythos

##### The First Player (only) draws a Mythos card

##### and performs the following actions:

##### 1. Open Gate and Spawn Monster (lower left)

###### No Elder Sign / Open Gate at Location:

```
Add a Doom token to the Doom track.
When half of the Ancient One’s Doom track
is full, martial law is declared in Innsmouth
for the rest of the game.
```
```
Draw a random Gate and place it faceup on the location.
Discard any Clue tokens there. Investigators there are
immediately moved to the corresponding Other World and
delayed. Monsters are never drawn through Gates.
```
```
When resolving the opening of a gate that has an alternate
gate , it opens in the upper of the 2 locations. If that location
is on a board not in play, the gate opens in the lower location.
```
```
Draw a monster and place it at the location (5+ players, place
2 monsters).
```
```
If this brings the total number of monsters over the monster
limit, place it in the Outskirts.
```
###### Open Gate at Location:

```
Monster surge: a number of monsters (the number of open
Gates or the number of players, whichever is greater) appear,
divided evenly among all open Gates (no Gate receives more
monsters than the location shown on the Mythos card).
```
```
If there are more monsters than the monster limit , players
choose where monsters will be placed before drawing;
remaining monsters go to the Outskirts.
```
###### Elder Sign at Location:

```
No Gate or monster.
If the location is colored red, there is a gate burst : the elder
sign is removed and a monster and gate are placed there (no
Doom token is placed on the Doom track however). Also, all
flying monsters move.
```
```
Each time a Gate is prevented from opening, add one token
to the Deep Ones Rising track.
```
##### 2. Place Clue Token (location in middle)

```
Only if there is no open Gate at that location.
If a player is there he may immediately take the Clue.
```
```
If the location is on a board not in play, disregard that
placement. If there is a choice of locations, use the first.
If that location is on a board not in play, use the second.
```
##### 3. Move Monsters (lower right)

```
Move monsters with a matching dimension symbol along the
arrow of the same color as the box around the symbol (half
white, half black arrows count as white and black).
```
```
A monster does not move if a player is in its location, and a
monster stops when it encounters a player.
Monsters do not fight players in this phase.
```
```
If there is an equal choice between player targets, target the
player with the lowest Sneak skill.
```
```
Black Normal.
```
```
Yellow Never moves.
Red Fast: Move twice.
```
```
Green Special: marker.
```
```
Purple Stalker: Move normally unless player in
street area connected by one yellow line
or adjacent street area or unstable location.
Can’t enter stable locations.
Blue Flying: Move to connected street area with
a player in it. Otherwise move to the Sky
(counts towards monster limit) and move
to any street location in Arkham next time.
Flyers will not leave a space containing a
player, and remain in the Sky if there are
no players in a street.
```
```
Orange Aquatic: If at an aquatic location, move to
any other aquatic location that contains an
investigator. Otherwise, move normally.
```
```
Move open rifts with a matching dimension symbol along
arrows of the same color as the box around the symbol.
Then place a monster at the rift’s new location. If the rift
moved along an arrow matching the color of the symbol on
the rift, add a Doom token to the Doom track.
```
```
Monsters that enter a vortex in Dunwich / Innsmouth are
returned to the cup. Raise the Terror level by one and add
one Dunwich Horror / Deep Ones Rising token to the Dunwich
Horror / Deep Ones Rising track.
Trigger any Corruption cards whose movement symbol and
background match the Mythos card.
Place a random rift progress marker faceup on any rift
progress track (if not already full) matching the movement
pattern on the card. Once all 4 spaces are full, the rift opens
and is placed at the Gate location shown on the card. Gates
and rifts do not interfere with each other.
```
##### 4. Activate Mythos Ability (top):

```
Headline: Resolve then discard.
Environment: Place faceup near the board.
Discard any previous Environment cards.
```
```
Rumor: Applies if no Rumor card is in play. Otherwise, ignore
the mythos text. A Rumor card and its markers in play is only
discarded when its Pass/Fail condition is met.
```
###### Skill Checks

##### Roll # of dice = ( skill value +/- modifier )

```
Skill difficulty is number of dice successes required to pass
the check (default difficulty is 1). If skill minus modifier is 0
or less, the check is automatically failed.
```
###### Normal success: 5 or 6 ( cursed: 6, blessed: 4, 5 or 6).

```
After a skill check (pass or fail), a player may
always spend Clues one at a time. For each Clue
spent, roll an additional die. Each success is
added to the original total.
```
```
A Clue gives you the bonus dice even if modifiers have dropped
the number of dice below 0.
```

###### Evading Monsters

**Evade Skill Check.** Use **Sneak** skill with _Sneak_ and _Evade_ Skill
bonuses, modified by monster’s **Awareness rating** _(upper right)._

```
Pass: continue as normal. Can move on or stay and interact
with the space in the Encounters phase.
Fail: Lose Stamina equal to icons, begin Combat.
```
If there is more than one monster in an area they must be
evaded, each in turn, in an order chosen by the player.

###### Combat

If evasion is not attempted or fails, proceed to **combat**.

##### 1. Horror Check

Only one **Horror Skill Check** per battle.

Use **Will** skill with _Will_ and _Horror_ Skill bonuses, modified by
the monster’s **Horror rating** _(lower left)._

Test difficulty is always 1 unless noted.

```
Pass: nothing happens.
Fail: lose Sanity equal to icons.
```
##### 2. Choose Flee or Fight

**Flee: Evade Skill Check.**

```
Pass: battle ends.
Fail: monster deals combat damage, continue combat.
```
**Fight: Combat Skill Check.** Use **Fight** skill with _Fight_ and
_Combat_ Skill bonuses, modified by the monster’s **Combat
rating** _(lower right)._

Choose any combination of weapons/spells up to a total of 2
**hand icons**. Bonuses only apply while the required number
of hands are devoted to the weapon/spell. You may switch
weapons between rounds, but the effects of a successfully cast
spell stop as soon as you remove that spell from your hand.

**Test difficulty** is the number of **Toughness** icons.
Partial success has no effect.

```
Pass: Take the monster chit as a trophy.
Fail: Lose Stamina equal to icons.
Then return to the Choose Flee or Fight step.
```
###### Casting Spells

Pay the **Sanity cost** of the spell and make a **Spell Skill Check**.

Use **Lore** skill with _Lore_ and _Spell_ Skill bonuses, modified by
the spell’s **casting modifier**.

If the check fails the spell has no effect (but still uses the
number of hand icons it requires).

Spells that are _refreshed_ (eg. each combat round in the Final
Battle) cease to work and must be re-cast.

###### Monster Abilities

**Ambush** Once combat has begun the investigator cannot flee.

**Elusive (Green Awareness rating)** Investigators do not need to
fight or evade the monster when leaving or ending movement
in its space. To initiate combat the investigator must first pass
an _Evade_ check (failing ends the investigator’s movement).

**Endless** The monster cannot be collected as a monster trophy.
It is returned to the cup if defeated.

**Nightmarish X** If the investigator passes a _Horror_ check he still
loses X sanity (does not apply if Horror check failed).

**Overwhelming X** If the investigator defeats this monster he still
loses X Stamina (does not apply if Combat check failed).

```
Physical/Magical Resistance Weapons, Spells and Magical
Effects providing Physical/Magical (as applicable) bonuses
provide half normal bonus (round up). Other abilities are not
affected.
```
```
Physical/Magical Immunity Weapons, Spells and Magical
Effects providing Physical/Magical (as applicable) bonuses give
no bonus. Other abilities are not affected.
```
```
Weapon Immunity Any combat bonus from Physical or Magical
Weapons is reduced to 0. Spells are not affected.
```
###### Sanity and Stamina

```
An investigator can never exceed the maximum Sanity or
Stamina as listed on his investigator sheet.
```
###### If Sanity and/or Stamina are ever reduced to 0:

```
Choose and discard half of the investigator’s items (count all
Common Items, Unique Items, Exhibit Items, Spells, Deputy’s
Revolver and Patrol Wagon); half of his Clues (round down);
and all of his Retainers.
```
```
Restore Sanity and Stamina to minimum of 1.
```
```
Alternatively, draw an Injury card and restore Stamina to
maximum (if 0 Stamina) or draw Madness card and restore
Sanity to maximum (if 0 Sanity). If a player has 2 or more
total Injury and/or Madness cards, he may voluntarily retire his
investigator by missing an entire turn and setting up another
(as if devoured, however this does not trigger effects that come
from being devoured).
```
```
In Arkham: If Sanity, go immediately to Arkham Asylum.
If Stamina, go to St. Mary’s Hospital. No encounters this turn.
```
```
In Other World: Player is Lost in Time and Space.
```
```
If Sanity and Stamina are both reduced to 0, or either’s
maximum is reduced to 0, the investigator is devoured.
```
###### Investigator Status

```
Arrested Move the investigator to the Jail Cell area of the
Police Station (or Innsmouth Jail if arrested in Innsmouth).
```
```
He loses half of his money (round down) and is delayed. Next
turn he may only stand his marker up in the Police Station.
```
```
Blessed / Cursed An investigator can have only one at a time.
If a Blessed investigator is Cursed , discard the Blessing and
vice versa.
```
```
Delayed Place the investigator marker on its side; the
investigator may not move or receive movement points.
```
```
Devoured Discard all cards except unspent trophies.
Randomly draw a new investigator and set up anew.
```
```
Lost in Time and Space Move to Lost in Time and Space area
and be delayed. Next turn the investigator can only stand up.
On the following turn he may move to any location or street
area in Arkham.
```
```
Benefits / Detriments If another investigator already has the
card, ignore instructions to take it. Once discarded, it becomes
available again. Players may have multiple Benefit/Detriment
cards in any combination.
```
```
Corruption A Corruption card’s effect may be triggered in the
Mythos phase (some cards have additional passive effects).
Place the green cards on top of the red cards to form the deck.
```
```
Magical Effects When an appropriate spell is cast, take the
corresponding Magical Effect card. They do not count as items
but use hand icons in combat like an item or spell.
```
```
The Innsmouth Look Shuffle and draw Innsmouth Look
cards as instructed. If the Look card is drawn, follow the
instructions. In any case return all cards to the deck.
```
```
Conditions Condition cards begin the game facedown and
are active when turned faceup. A condition that is exhausted
is rotated 90º. Exhausted condition cards refresh during the
Upkeep phase as normal.
```
```
Tasks and Missions The locations must be visited in the listed
order, with the investigator ending his move (and performing
the proper sacrifice at the start of the Upkeep phase if
required) and then placing a Clue token on the card to indicate
completion of a step. After completing all steps, receive the
payoff or resolve the effect and return the card to the box.
```
###### Monster Limit and the Outskirts

```
The maximum number of monsters in Arkham (including the
Sky area, but not other boards) is the number of players +
(unless terror level is at 10).
```
```
If adding a monster would bring the number of monsters above
the monster limit, place the monster in the Outskirts area.
Spawn monsters do not count towards the monster limit, never
go to the Outskirts, and can never be claimed as trophies.
Once the number of monsters in the Outskirts exceeds
8 minus the number of players, return all monsters in
the Outskirts to the cup and increase the terror level by 1.
Continue adding drawn monsters to the Outskirts if applicable.
```
###### The Dunwich Horror

```
If 3 Dunwich Horror tokens are on the Dunwich Horror track,
take the Dunwich Horror marker and place it on Sentinel Hill.
```
```
If an investigator combats the creature, shuffle the Dunwich
Horror deck and draw a card to determine the creature’s
abilities for the duration of the combat.
```
```
If the creature is defeated, remove the tokens from the DH
track, and the investigator may search the Common Item,
Unique Item, Skill, Spell or Ally decks for any one card to keep.
```
###### The Deep Ones Rising

```
Each time a Gate is prevented from opening (eg. an elder sign
or investigator special ability), add one token to the Deep Ones
Rising track.
During the Upkeep phase, any investigator on an Innsmouth
location or street may spend 1 or more Clue tokens to place
them on the Feds Raid Innsmouth track spaces of the same
color as the neighborhood he is in.
```
```
If the Feds Raid Innsmouth track ever fills up, both it and the
Deep Ones Rising tracks are cleared.
```
###### Terror Track

```
For each point the terror level goes up, return to the box a
random unclaimed Ally card (if any left). Also:
```
```
If the terror level reaches 3 , close General Store.
Players and monsters inside move to Rivertown.
```
```
If the terror level reaches 6 , close the Curiositie Shoppe.
Players and monsters inside move to Northside.
```
```
If the terror level reaches 9 , close the Magick Shoppe.
Players and monsters inside move to Uptown.
```
```
If the terror level reaches 10 , return all monsters in the
Outskirts to the cup. The monster limit is removed. If the
terror level increases again (eg. via a Mythos card), instead
add 1 Doom token to the Doom track for each point it
should have increased.
```
```
All Patrol markers are discarded when the Terror level goes up.
There can be only one on a specific street area at a time.
```
###### Ancient One Awakens!

```
When one of the following occurs the Ancient One awakes:
immediately go to the Final Battle:
```
```
Doom track is full
```
```
Too many Gates open:
1-2 players: 8 Gates 5-6 players: 6 Gates
3-4 players: 7 Gates 7-8 players: 5 Gates
If using Dunwich and Innsmouth together, increase the
number of gates by one.
```
```
A new Gate opens and there are no Gate markers left.
```
```
A monster should be drawn but there are no monsters
left in the cup, or a new gate would open but there are no
gate markers available.
```
```
The Terror level is 10 and the number of monsters in
Arkham is twice the normal monster limit.
```
```
A player must draw a Corruption card and there are none.
```
```
The Deep Ones Rising track is full.
```
###### Final Battle

```
First fill the Doom track with Doom tokens. All players Lost
in Time and Space are devoured and eliminated. Discard any
active Environment or Rumor cards.
```
```
Survivors must battle the Ancient One. Once the final battle
begins, players can no longer collect money, Power tokens,
gain Clue tokens, or roll for Retainers or Bank Loans.
```
```
Epic Battle Variant: shuffle the 8 red Epic Battle cards, then
shuffle the 8 green Epic Battle cards and place them on top
to form the Epic Battle deck. Separately shuffle the 3 Ancient
One Plot cards. After the Upkeep phase of each combat round
draw an Epic Battle card and follow the instructions for the
combat round. A new combat round then begins.
```
```
Each combat round:
Upkeep Each player still alive may refresh cards, use character
abilities, adjust skill sliders and trade equipment with other
players. Pass the first player marker to the left.
```
```
Attack Each player still alive starting from the first player may
make a Combat Check against the Ancient One, modified by
its Combat rating.
The players must get a total number of successes equal to the
number of players (including eliminated players) to remove a
Doom token. Successes are carried over to subsequent rounds
but reset to zero after removing a Doom token.
```
```
When the last Doom token is removed, players win.
```
```
Ancient One Attacks The Ancient One attacks each player in
turn using the attack shown on its card. Any player reduced
to 0 Stamina or Sanity is eliminated. If all investigators are
eliminated, players lose. Otherwise, start a new round.
```
###### Winning

```
Victory Conditions
Close the Gates A player closes the last open Gate on the
board, and players have Gate trophies (including the Gate just
closed, but not including trophies spent) equal to or greater
than the number of players.
```
```
Seal the Gates 6 or more Elder Sign tokens on board.
```
```
Banish the Ancient One Ancient One is defeated.
```
```
First Citizen of Arkham
The player with the most Gate trophies (break ties by most
monster trophies). Scoring: see p12 of AH, p8 of DH rules.
```

Horror** cards, 3 **Dunwich Horror** tokens, 24 **Injury** cards,
24 **Madness** cards, 8 **Sheldon Gang Membership** cards,
8 **Rail Pass** cards, 4 **Condition** cards.

**Glaaki Ancient One:** 5 **Servants of Glaaki** monster markers.
**Shudde M’ell Ancient One:** 7 **Rubble** markers.

###### Rules Modifications

###### Setup

For _each_ expansion board in play beyond one board, count
the number of players as being _one less_ for all in-game effects
_except_ when counting successes fighting the Ancient One.

**If using the Dunwich and Innsmouth boards together** , increase
the number of Gates that must be open to awaken the Ancient
One by one.

Place Clue tokens on unstable locations (red diamond) in
Dunwich as well as Arkham.

Set aside **Spawn** monsters.

To prepare the **Ally deck** , randomly deal **11 cards** , examine
them, then shuffle into a facedown deck. Remaining cards are
not used. Allies taken as starting equipment come from this
deck of 11 cards. If a specific Ally is part of an investigator’s
fixed possessions, that Ally must be one of the 11 Allies used.

###### Movement

Investigators may move between towns (boards) by spending
$1 and one movement point to move between one **depot**
(train icon) location to another (including the **Train Station** ).

Investigators can _never_ enter a **vortex**.

###### Gate Bursts

Mythos cards with a red gate location indicate **gate bursts**.
These work normally, however if the location has an elder
sign token on it, the token is removed and the gate opens
as normal. A doom token is _not_ placed on the track and a
monster surge is not caused.

Also, **whenever a gate burst is drawn** **_all_** **flying monsters move**.

###### Vortexes

```
Investigators can never enter vortex spaces.
```
```
Monsters that enter a vortex space are returned to the cup.
Raise the Terror level by one and add one Dunwich Horror
token to the Dunwich Horror track.
```
###### Injury and Madness

```
If an investigator’s Sanity or Stamina are ever reduced to 0,
as an alternative, draw an Injury card and restore Stamina to
maximum (if 0 Stamina) or draw a Madness card and restore
Sanity to maximum (if 0 Sanity).
```
```
The investigator does not lose any items or Clue tokens, but
he must still move to Arkham Asylum, St. Mary’s Hospital or
Lost in Time and Space , as appropriate.
```
```
Injury and Madness cards are not items and cannot be traded.
```
```
Retirement If a player has 2 or more total Injury and/or Madness
cards, he may voluntarily retire his investigator by missing an
entire turn and setting up another (as if devoured, however
this does not trigger effects that come from being devoured).
```
###### Investigator Status

```
Conditions Condition cards begin the game facedown and are
active when turned faceup.
```
```
A condition that is exhausted is turned 90º. Exhausted
condition cards refresh during the Upkeep phase as normal.
```
```
Tasks and Missions The locations must be visited in the
listed order, with the investigator ending his move (and
performing the proper sacrifice at the start of the Upkeep
phase if required) and then placing a Clue token on the card
to indicate completion of a step. If it is discarded or given to
another investigator, all Clue tokes are removed from the card.
```
```
After completing all steps, receive payoff or resolve effect and
return the card to the box, discarding Clue tokens on it.
```
###### The Dunwich Horror

```
If 3 Dunwich Horror tokens are on the Dunwich Horror track,
take the Dunwich Horror marker and place it on Sentinel Hill.
```
```
If an investigator combats the creature, shuffle the Dunwich
Horror deck and draw a card to determine the creature’s
abilities for the duration of the combat.
```
```
If the creature is defeated, remove the tokens from the
Dunwich Horror track, and the investigator may search the
Common Item, Unique Item, Skill, Spell or Ally decks for any
one card to keep.
```
###### Monsters

```
Monsters on the Dunwich board do not count against the
monster limit and do not go to the Outskirts.
```
```
Flying monsters in Dunwich may move to the Sky as normal.
Dunwich streets are considered adjacent to the Sky.
```
```
Spawn monsters do not count towards the monster limit,
never go to the Outskirts, and can never be claimed as
trophies.
Monster Movement Abilities
```
```
Purple Stalker: Move normally unless an investigator
is in a street area connected by one yellow line
or an adjacent street area or unstable location.
If there is a choice of investigators, move
toward the one with the lowest Sneak skill.
Stalkers cannot enter stable locations.
```
###### Miscellany / Clarifications

```
The phrase in Arkham also refers to locations and areas in
Dunwich, Kingsport and Innsmouth unless specifically stated.
```
```
Allies, Exhausted: An exhausted ally still grants its bonuses,
but abilities that require the ally to exhaust cannot be used.
```
```
Glaaki Ancient One: At the end of the game, keep track of
which Servants of Glaaki were in play. Those not in play
can still enter play as Glaaki’s attack raises the Terror level,
causing Allies to be discarded. Once they have all ‘entered
play’, they have no further effect.
```
```
Shudde M’ell Ancient One: Any investigator or monster in a
destroyed location is moved to the street.

### the dunwich horror


###### Special Components

**Kingsport** board, 56 **Kingsport Location** cards, 2 **Captain
of the White Ship** cards, 2 **Changed** cards, 3 **Rift** markers,
12 **Rift Progress** markers, 2 **Aquatic** markers.

**Epic Battle variant:** 16 **Epic Battle** cards, 45 **Ancient One
Plot** cards.

**Bast Guardian:** 2 **Beloved of Bast** cards, 8 **Bast** tokens.
**Nodens Guardian:** 20 **Blessings of Nodens** cards.
**Hypnos Guardian:** 26 **Visions of Hypnos** cards.

**Eihort Ancient One:** 48 **Brood** tokens.

###### Rules Modifications

###### Setup

For _each_ expansion board in play beyond one board, count
the number of players as being _one less_ for all in-game effects
_except_ when counting successes fighting the Ancient One.

Place Clue tokens on unstable locations (red diamond) in
Kingsport as well as Arkham.

To prepare the **Ally deck** , randomly deal **11 cards** , examine
them, then shuffle into a facedown deck. Remaining cards are
not used. Allies taken as starting equipment come from this
deck of 11 cards. If a specific Ally is part of an investigator’s
fixed possessions, that Ally must be one of the 11 Allies used.

Place the **Aquatic markers** on the River Docks and Unvisited
Isle locations on the AH board.

Randomly place the 3 **Rift markers** facedown on the 3 **Rift
Tracks** on the Kingsport board. When drawing and resolving
a Mythos card during setup, if the monster movement pattern
is one shown on one of the 3 Rift tracks, draw a rift progress
marker and place it one that track.

Optionally, draw or choose a **Herald** and/or **Guardian**. Place
the sheet(s) next to the Ancient One and follow the setup
instructions.

###### Movement

Investigators may move between towns (boards) by spending
$1 and one movement point to move between one **depot** (train
icon) location to another (including the **Train Station** ).

No direct move is allowed into the **Kingsport Head** locations
using spells, equipment, or unusual methods such as
returning from _Lost in Time and Space._ Investigators entering
the Causeway or Wireless Station must end their movement.

When an investigator returns from being _Lost in Time and
Space,_ he may return to return to anywhere in Arkham _except_
**Kingsport Head** locations.

###### Gate Bursts

```
Mythos cards with a red gate location indicate gate bursts.
These work normally, however if the location has an elder
sign token on it, the token is removed and the gate opens
as normal. A doom token is not placed on the track and a
monster surge is not caused.
```
```
Also, whenever a gate burst is drawn all flying monsters move.
```
###### Rifts

```
Each time a Mythos card is resolved , place a random rift
progress marker faceup on any rift progress track (if not
already full) matching the movement pattern on the card.
```
```
Once all 4 spaces are full, the rift opens and is placed at the
Gate location shown on the card (even if there is an elder sign
token there). Gates and rifts do not interfere with each other.
```
```
Starting on the Mythos phase of the turn after it opens, if
a drawn Mythos card indicates that monsters with the rift’s
dimensional symbol move, the open rift moves along arrows
of the same color as the box around the symbol. Then place
a monster at the rift’s new location.
```
```
Monsters entering the board through rifts are subject to the
usual monster limit.
```
```
If the rift moved along an arrow matching the color of the
symbol on the rift, add a Doom token to the doom track.
```
```
Each rift progress marker depicts a Kingsport location.
An investigator can only investigate one rift progress marker
for each encounter, even if several rift progress markers show
that location.
```
```
After an encounter at the depicted location, if the

time a Mythos card entitled _The Next Act Begins_ is drawn, the
top card of the Act deck enters play.

###### Investigator Status

corresponding Magical Effect card. They do not count as items
but use _hand icons_ in combat like an item or Spell.

###### Play Styles

Item, Unique Item, Gate, Mythos and Location cards on top of
their respective AH decks.

###### Special Components

```
8 Cult Membership cards, 32 Corruption cards, 24 Cult
Encounter cards, 5 Difficulty cards.
```
###### Rules Modifications

###### Gate Bursts

```
Mythos cards with a red gate location indicate gate bursts.
These work normally, however if the location has an elder
sign token on it, the token is removed and the gate opens
as normal. A doom token is not placed on the track and a
monster surge is not caused.
Also, whenever a gate burst is drawn all flying monsters move.
```
###### Investigator Status

```
Cult Membership and Encounters An investigator with a “One
of the Thousand” Cult Membership who has an encounter at
the Black Cave, the Unvisited Isle, or the Woods, must draw
from the Cult Encounters deck instead of the location deck.
```
```
Corruption Place the green cards on top of the red cards to
form the Corruption deck. An investigator may have more than
one Corruption card at a time.
```
```
A Corruption card’s effect is triggered when both its movement
symbol and matching background appear on a Mythos card.
Corruption cards are resolved immediately after monster
movement. Some cards have additional passive effects that are
always in effect.
```
```
When a Gate is closed, all Corruption cards in play that
match its dimension symbol are discarded. The deck is never
reshuffled. If a player must draw a Corruption card and there
are none, the Ancient One immediately awakens.
```
###### Play Styles

```
The Herald Variant Add the Black Goat of the Woods
Herald sheet. Place all monsters markers with the hexagon
dimensional symbol in a separate cup. Whenever a Gate
opens , follow the rules on the Herald sheet. Even if the cup

###### Special Components

12 **Relationship** cards, 18 **Gate** markers.

**Herald variant:** 35 **Power** tokens, 24 **Dark Pact** cards 28
**Reckoning** cards.

###### Rules Modifications

###### Setup

Replace all **gate markers** from the base game and expansions
with the new gate markers.

In games with only 2 players, after receiving his random
possessions, the first player draws a card from the **Relationship**
deck and places it between himself and the other player. In
games with 3+ players, each player draws a card from the
Relationship deck and places it between himself and the player
to his left.

###### Gate Bursts

Mythos cards with a red gate location indicate **gate bursts**.
These work normally, however if the location has an elder sign
token on it, the token is removed and the gate opens as normal.
A doom token is _not_ placed on the track and a monster surge
is not caused. Also, **whenever a gate burst is drawn** **_all_** **flying
monsters move**.

###### Relationship Cards

The partner in a relationship is always the investigator to the left
of the player who received this card. In games with 3+ players,
each player benefits from both his own card and the card drawn
by the player to his right.

When an investigator is devoured, return both his Relationship
card and the card of the player to his right back to the box. In a
2 player game, if either investigator is devoured, return the card
to the box. New Relationship cards are not drawn.

###### Gate Markers

**Closing and Sealing Gates** It may be possible to close a gate
either in a stable location or in the streets. **A gate may only be
sealed when it is located on an unstable location**. Gates in a
stable location or in the streets can be closed, but not sealed.

```
The new gate markers are treated the same as the previous Gate
markers with the following additions:
```
```
Devouring Gate: If an investigator is in the same
location as this gate when it opens, he is devoured.
```
```
Gate of Doom: If an investigator is in the same location
as this gate when it opens, add a doom token to the
doom track.
```
```
Endless Gate: This gate marker cannot be collected as
a gate trophy. Instead, each time it is closed or sealed,
reshuffle it into the gate marker stack.
```
```
Monstrous Gate: If an investigator fails his check to
close this gate, a monster appears in his location. If
this brings the number of monsters over the monster
limit, place the monster in the Outskirts instead.
Gate of Blood: If an investigator fails his check to close
this gate, he loses 1 Stamina.
Gate of Madness: If an investigator fails his check to
close this gate, he loses 1 Sanity.
Moving Gate: If the dimensional symbol of this gate is
activated during monster movement, the gate moves as
if it were a normal monster.
```
```
The first player chooses the moving order of multiple moving
gates. A gate does not move if there is a gate marker in the
location it would move into. If a gate moves onto an investigator,
he is pulled through. If this gate moves away from an
investigator who has explored it, he loses his explored token.
A moving gate never moves into a vortex.
Split Gate: An investigator drawn through a gate with 2 Other
Worlds on the marker may choose which to move to. An
investigator returning to Arkham from either of the Other Worlds
may choose to move to the gate marker’s location and place an
explored token. He does not need to have explored both Other
Worlds to close a split gate. When closed, all monsters in Arkham,
the Sky, and the Outskirts that have either of the dimensional
symbols on the marker are returned to the monster cup.
```
###### Play Styles

```
The Herald Variant
Add the Lurker at the Threshold Herald sheet , the Power tokens,
the Dark Pact cards, and the Reckoning cards. Separate the
Dark Pact cards into Blood Pacts, Soul Pacts, and Bound Allies.
Add the rules listed on the Lurker at the Threshold Herald sheet.
```
```
If no Power tokens are available, any ability or effect that would
give them to a player is ignored. If more than one player receives
Power tokens and there are not enough for everyone, the first
player chooses the order in which players receive their tokens.
```
```
An exhausted Soul or Blood Pact is turned sideways instead
of facedown. An investigator knocked unconscious or driven
insane does not lose any Dark Pacts or Power tokens. A devoured
investigator loses all Dark Pacts and Power tokens.
```

###### Special Components

22 **Exhibit Item** cards, 18 **Exhibit Encounter** cards, 4 **Benefit**
and 4 **Detriment** cards, 1 **Ancient Whispers** marker, 9 **Patrol**
markers.

**Herald variant:** 1 **Dark Pharoah** Herald sheet.

###### Rules Modifications

###### Setup

Return all components from the original edition of _The Curse
of the Dark Pharoah_ expansion to the box.

Place the **Ancient Whispers marker** on the _Miskatonic University_
street area.

To prepare the Ally deck, randomly deal **11 cards** , examine
them, then shuffle into a facedown deck. Remaining cards are
not used. Allies taken as starting equipment come from this
deck of 11 cards. If a specific Ally is part of an investigator’s
fixed possessions, that Ally must be one of the 11 Allies used.

###### Investigator Status

**Patrolled Neighborhoods**
If you are instructed to place a **Patrol marker** on a specific
street area, do not add a second if there is already one there.

Each time you attempt to leave, or end your movement in, a
street area with a Patrol marker, you must make a Sneak (+0)
check. If you fail, you are **arrested**.

**All Patrol markers are discarded when the Terror level goes up.**

**Benefits / Detriments**
If another player already has the card, ignore the instructions to
take it. When a Benefit or Detriment card is discarded, it is once
again available to be taken by any investigator instructed to do
so. Players may have multiple Benefit or Detriment cards in any
combination.

###### Ancient Whispers and Exhibit Encounters

```
During the Arkham Encounters Phase, if you are in a street area
with the Ancient Whispers marker your must have an Exhibit
Encounter. Shuffle the Exhibit Encounters deck , draw a card,
read the text aloud, perform any actions indicated, and return
the card to the deck.
```
```
If a game effect results in a gate marker being in this street
area, the investigator does not have an Exhibit Encounter, but
is instead drawn through the gate.
Each card includes instructions to move the Ancient Whispers
marker to a new street area. If an investigator is in this new
street area, he does not also have an Exhibit Encounter. No
more than 1 investigator can have an Exhibit Encounter in a
single turn.
```
```
If the Ancient Whispers marker did not move during the Arkham
Encounters Phase, it moves during the Mythos Phase as if it
were a monster with the moon dimensional symbol according
to normal monster movement rules (disregard the presence of
investigator markers in its current street area).
```
```
If the Ancient Whispers marker did move during the Arkham
Encounters phase, it does not move during the Mythos Phase.
The marker may not be removed from the board by any game
effect, and it does not affect, nor is it affected by, any other
tokens or markers on the board.
```
###### Play Styles

```
The Herald Variant
Add the Dark Pharoah Herald sheet. Place the Dark Pharaoh
monster token in the monster cup, even if Nyarlathotep is not
the Ancient One.
```
```
Add the rules listed on the Dark Pharaoh Herald sheet:
```
- Each time an investigator gains a Unique Item (including
    starting equipment), that investigator loses 1 Sanity.
- Each time an investigator gains an Exhibit Item, roll a die.
    On a failure, that investigator is _Cursed_.
- At the start of the Upkeep Phase, before rolling to get rid of
    Curses, each _Cursed_ investigator loses 1 Stamina.
- All _Mask_ monsters gain 1 toughness. In addition, each time
    a _Mask_ monster is defeated, add 1 doom token to the Ancient
    One’s doom track.
- If _Nyarlathotep_ is the Ancient One and he awakens, his
    combat modifier increases by 1 (to -5, -6, etc.) and he has
    one extra doom token placed on his doom track (for a total
    of 12, 13, etc.) for each _Mask_ monster on the board.

neighborhood may move into its streets but not its locations,
unless the location has an open Gate, or as a result of actions
taken in non-Movement phases (eg. returning from being lost in
time and space , arrested, sent to the Asylum etc). If there are

###### Rules Modifications

###### Player Reference Sheet

Place the **Player Reference sheet** that corresponds to the
number of players next to the board.

###### Blight Cards

When determining whether or not to ignore an encounter
because it mentions a person who appears on a **Blight card** that
is in play, the encounter must mention the person by name.

If an encounter mentions the name of a person who appears on
a Blight card that is in play, but is not actually referring to the
person, do not ignore that encounter.

###### New Epic Battle Variant Cards

The new Epic Battle cards have 2 new types of cards:

###### Mythos Cards with Alternate Gates

When a player is resolving the opening of a gate that has an
**alternate gate** , the gate opens in the **upper** of the 2 locations.

However, if that location is on an expansion board not in play,
the gate opens in the **lower** location instead.

If a Mythos card instructs you to place a Clue token on a
location that is on a board not in play, disregard that placement.
If there is a choice of locations, use the first if possible, or use
the second if that first location is on a board not in play.

When resolving a Mythos card with an alternate gate, the upper
location is used. A gate burst only occurs in the lower location if
the upper location is on a board not in play.

    tokens are placed on it).
- The Dunwich Horror has a circle dimensional symbol as well
    as a moon dimensional symbol, but only for purposes of
    movement. It cannot be banished or pulled through a gate
    because of this symbol.
- When the Dunwich Horror moves, it adds 1 doom token to the
    Ancient One’s doom track on a 2-6 instead of a 4-6.
- If Yog-Sothoth is the Ancient One, and he awakens while
    the Dunwich Horror is on the board, Yog-Sothoth’s combat
    modifier increases by 3 (to -8) and he has 5 extra doom
    tokens placed on his doom track (for a total of 17).

###### House Rules for Arkham Horror by Richard Launius

##### Game Preparation

**Two Monsters on First Gate**
During setup, when placing the first open Gate, draw and
place 2 monsters on the Gate rather than 1. Additionally,
if playing with 4 or more players, have 2 monsters appear
each time a new Gate is drawn.

_From an adventure perspective, this sets the tone early,
especially with first time players, that bad things are
happening in Arkham. From a game play perspective, this
offers more opportunity immediately for monsters to move
and for the investigators to kill some monsters quickly. If
using the continual 2 monsters appearance as new Gates
are revealed, this puts more pressure on the players of
games with 4 or more players to battle the monsters or
they will quickly begin to see the Terror track rise, and
battling monsters will mean they cannot just hold all their
Clue tokens for sealing of Gates._

**Choosing Investigators**
At the start of play, randomly deal 2 or 3 Investigator cards
to each player. Players must choose their investigator from
those dealt to them.

_Prohibits always using the same Investigators, but still
allows for some choice. This assignment process forces
the players to use different characters from game to game,
and therefore different strategies. It also increases game
replayability and overall fun._

##### Playing the Game

**Gate Locations Unknown**
All Gates are placed facedown on the board rather than
faceup. The Gate is only revealed when an investigator
goes to the location and travels through it. At the point
an investigator enters the location and announces they
are traveling through the Gate, flip the Gate over and the
investigator immediately moves through it. (This works
best with the _Choose to Travel Through Gate_ rule.)

_Creates mystery and makes the game even more interesting.
No longer can any players rush their investigator to a Gate
because they know it is the Dreamlands and they feel more
comfortable about traveling to that location than the Abyss.
This rule does make the game a little more difficult, but
the trade-off is it creates a lot of dialog and role-playing
with a creative crowd._

**Choose to Travel through Gate**
Locations with Gates do not automatically suck the
investigator through. Moving through a Gate is a choice
for the player, unless a Gate opens at a location where
an investigator just happens to be visiting—then they are
sucked through as normal.

_Enables players more choices and opportunities to have
Arkham location encounters. My logic for the rule is that
the gate is not huge, probably only 12 feet by 12 feet and
may even be in the basement of the building. The areas at
each location are large—buildings with multiple floors and
rooms, or acres of thick woods so there is an opportunity
to still have normal encounters in a location even though
nasty creatures may be slithering through a gate in the
basement below..._

```
Insanity results in Permanent Memory Loss
Going insane causes the investigator to discard 1 Spell or
1 Skill to meet the requirements. This replaces the loss
of half their items. Loss of half their Clue tokens is still
applied—things they have forgotten from the trauma.
```
```
It seems like a logical effect of the insanity, but it also
makes strong fighters respect the monsters that inflict
greater Sanity loss when they realize it may cost them a
valuable Skill or Spell.
```
```
Monster Guards Sucked Through Closing Gates
Monsters guarding a Gate (on the same space) are sucked
through the Gate when it is closed. Players do not get to
claim these monsters as trophies, only the Gate.
The creatures did not see (or understand) the actions of
the investigator, so were caught off guard and sucked
through the gate just like any monsters that match the
symbol on the Gate token. This is helpful with novice
players and a lot of monsters roaming the board and
especially valuable for disposing of the stronger monsters.
I primarily use this house rule when playing with 2
monsters appearing at each new Gate.
```
```
Sanity Loss for Trapping Another Investigator in a Gate
The investigators are responsible for their actions, so
sealing a gate that traps another investigator with no
way to return to Arkham is something that should haunt
them. Therefore, in the event this should happen, the
investigator should lose D3 Sanity (roll a die and divide
the result by 2, rounding up). The players may expand this
to include any activity in which a player inflicts damage
knowingly to another player.
Adds to the role-play aspect and fun of the game. This
rule existed in the original Arkham Horror , but of course
the penalty for being trapped in a Gate in the original
was death. While we have softened that somewhat in
the current edition with only penalizing the trapped
investigator by sending them to Lost in Space & Time, they
still lose half their items and half their Clues. Therefore
the investigator that causes such pain (even if there is
good reason, like making sure no new monster appeared)
should be haunted by their actions.
```
```
One Round of Combat—Free Evade
With novice players I give the option to continue to fight
after one round or to get a free evade, which ends their
turn and allows them to leave this space freely on the
next move.
```
```
They may not have an encounter at this location as they
are hiding from the monster that is there. This does not
free them from any new monster combat as the result of
monster movement in the Mythos phase.
This rule enables the novice players to leave after 1 round of
combat without being reduced to 0 Stamina in subsequent
rounds. Therefore they can choose to go to the hospital
on future turns and heal rather than being carted there by
an ambulance and discarding half their items, spells and
money. This rule speeds up game play by not only reducing
what may be fatal combat rounds, but more importantly by
reducing the turns required for injured investigators to build
back up by replacing the stuff they lost.
```
```
No Victory for Sealed Gates
Us this rule when you want a tougher game, especially
with veteran players. This has no effect on play other than
removing one of the paths to victory.
```
```
Sealed Gates continue to prohibit new Gates from opening
at the location, and are therefore still valuable in the play
of the game.
```
```
Toughens the game and forces the players to use new
strategies. Should be considered by experienced players,
especially if they win more than 50% of the games they
play.
```
```
Double Gate Appearance
With 5 or more players, begin having 2 Gates appear once
the Great Old One’s Doom track reaches 6. This rule is a
change to the Mythos phase in that after the first Mythos
card is drawn and all actions completed, a second Mythos
card is now drawn and only the Gate portion of this second
card is used.
```
```
If the location on the second card does not have a Gate
and is not sealed, a Gate is placed on that location. If
the location has a Gate on it, 1 monster comes through
that Gate, not the other Gates on the board as in a normal
monster surge.
```
```
If the location is sealed by an Elder Sign, the Elder Sign is
broken and discarded. No Gate appears, but the warding
has been broken by the will of the Great Old One.
```
```
Toughens the game considerably for larger group play. Also
starts out slower and puts more pressure on later in the
game. Creates a random end game—when only two spaces
are left on the Doom track the Great Old One could arrive
at any turn.
```
```
Great Old Ones Really Great
For players that would like a tougher end game:
```
**1. Sanity Rolls for the Great Old One using their Combat**
    **Modifier as the Sanity Modifier.** If failed discard
    half your items, half your spells, and half your allies
    (rounding up). Then the Start of Battle begins combat
    with the Great Old One per normal rules.
**2. If less than 4 investigators in the game, treat 4 as the**
    **‘to hit’ number each round of combat.** This means it
    takes 4 hits to remove one token from the Great Old
    One’s Doom track. And no—hits are not banked from
    round to round if less than 4, they are lost after the
    Investigators complete their attacks and the Great Old
    One attacks.
**3. Special non-combat abilities may not be used unless**
    **no attack is taken and may only be used once the**
    **entire battle.** In other words using a some skill or item
    to restore Health or Sanity may only be used once in
    combat with the Great Old One.

```
All these rules significantly make it tougher for any size
group to successfully defeat the Great Old One.
```
```
The final battle is intended to be a last ditch effort to save
Arkham—not the primary plan of any team for victory.
These house rules assure veteran players cannot just stock
up weapons and wait for the big guy to arrive.
```
```
Keeper of the Old One
This rule is for one player to act as the game keeper or
game master and control the flow of the game. Works best
with large numbers of players (especially if they are new
to the game).
The keeper controls all Mythos draws, monster movement,
and encounter card resolution. For Mythos card draws,
they draw 2 cards and put one in play each turn,
discarding the other. They move the monsters according
to the card draw, adjust the Doom track and Terror track
when required, they fan the encounter cards for locations
and let the player at that location pick one that they then
read to the player. They also draw any Gate cards for other
world encounters and read the encounter to the players.
```
```
In essence they control the flow of the game for the
enjoyment of the players like any game master in a role
playing game.
Speeds up play for larger and new play groups. Represents
the expert on any rule issues, and sets the mood by
reading the encounters and forcing players to quickly
make their choices. Often, an experienced player in this
game can increase or decrease the play of the game by the
Mythos card they put into play each turn to better match
the adventure to the players.
```
##### Solitaire Play

```
Team of Investigators
In solitaire (and 2 player games) deal 6 investigators and
keep 4 to play. The game is played using 4 players as the
base for victory conditions, monsters, combat with the
Great Old One, etc.
It is more fun and more competitive to play as a team
of investigators. This way, if one investigator is having
tough luck, the others can keep you in the game. The
team creates more strategic opportunities for the player,
and in the end makes for a better adventure and gaming
experience.
