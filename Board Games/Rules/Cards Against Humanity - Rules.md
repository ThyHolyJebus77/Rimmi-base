# Cards Against Humanity
Basic Rules
To start the game, each player draws ten White Cards.

The person who most recently pooped begins as the
Card Czar and plays a Black Card. The Card Czar
reads the question or fill-in-the-blank phrase on the
Black Card out loud.

Everyone else answers the question or fills in the
blank by passing one White Card, face down, to the
Card Czar.

The Card Czar shuffles all of the answers and shares
each card combination with the group. For full effect,
the Card Czar should usually re-read the Black Card
before presenting each answer. The Card Czar then
picks the funniest play, and whoever submitted it
gets one Awesome Point.

After the round, a new player becomes the Card Czar,
and everyone draws back up to ten White Cards.

 

PIcK®@

Some cards say PICK 2 on the bottom.

To answer these, each player plays two White Cards in
combination. Play them in the order that the Card Czar
should read them—the order matters.

If the Card Czar has lobster claws for hands, you can
use paperclips to secure the cards in the right order.

 

Gambling

If a Black Card is played and you have more than one
White Card that you think could win, you can bet one
of your Awesome Points to play an additional

White Card.

If you win, you keep your point. If you lose, whoever
won the round gets the point you wagered.

House Rules

Cards Against Humanity is meant to be remixed. Here
are some of our favorite ways to pimp out the rules:

Happy Ending: When you’re ready to stop playing,
play the “Make a Haiku” Black Card to end the game.
This is the official ceremonial ending of a good game
of Cards Against Humanity, and this card should

be reserved for the end. (Note: Haikus don’t need

to follow the 5-7-5 form. They just have to be read
dramatically).

Rebooting the Universe: At any time, players may
trade in an Awesome Point to return as many White
Cards as they’d like to the deck and draw back

up to ten.

Packing Heat: For Pick 2s, all players draw an extra
card before playing the hand to open up more options.

Rando Cardrissian: Every round, pick one random
White Card from the pile and place it into play. This
card belongs to an imaginary player named Rando
Cardrissian, and if he wins the game, all players

go home in a state of everlasting shame.

God Is Dead: Play without a Card Czar. Each player
picks his or her favorite card each round. The card
with the most votes wins the round.

Survival of the Fittest: After everyone has answered
the question, players take turns eliminating one card
each. The last remaining card is declared the funniest.

Serious Business: Instead of picking a favorite card
each round, the Card Czar ranks the top three in order.
The best card gets 3 Awesome Points, the second-
best gets 2, and the third gets 1. Keep a running tally
of the score, and at the end of the game, the winner is
declared the funniest, mathematically speaking.

Never Have I Ever: At any time, players may discard
cards that they don’t understand, but they must
confess their ignorance to the group and suffer the
resulting humiliation.
