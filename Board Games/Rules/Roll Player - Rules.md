## Quick Start Rules Guide

1. Setup:
   - Each player gets a character sheet, class card, alignment card, and backstory card
   - Set up the market deck and initiative cards in the center of the table
   - Give each player starting gold (5 for first player, +1 for each additional player)

2. Game Round:
   Each round has four phases:

   a) Roll Phase:
   - First player rolls dice and places them on initiative cards

   b) Dice Phase:
   - In turn order, players choose an initiative card
   - Take the die/dice from that card and place on your character sheet
   - Dice must be placed left to right in attribute rows
   - You may use one attribute action after placing dice

   c) Market Phase:
   - In initiative order, players can:
     • Buy one card from the market
     • Discard a market card for 2 gold
     • Go on a hunt (roll dice to defeat a monster for rewards)

   d) Cleanup Phase:
   - Refresh market cards
   - Return dice to bag
   - Prepare for next round

3. Key Concepts:
   - Attributes: Six rows on your character sheet (Strength, Dexterity, etc.)
   - Gold: Used to buy market cards
   - Experience: Used for rerolls and special actions
   - Alignment: Affects which cards you can buy

4. Winning the Game:
   - Game ends when all attribute slots are filled
   - Face the final monster in a dice-rolling battle
   - Player with the most reputation points wins

5. Tips:
   - Try to match your class and backstory goals
   - Balance buying cards with saving gold
   - Pay attention to your alignment for card purchases

Remember, you're creating a fantasy character - have fun with it!

- Each class has unique attribute goals that provide bonus points if met
- Classes don't have major gameplay differences but influence strategy and scoring

## Additional Notes
Roll Player has several expansions that add new mechanics and content, including Monsters & Minions which adds a more robust monster-fighting system.

# Roll Player - Rules

Setup
Shufflethe two-dot market cards. Set them down to form the market deck. Shuffle the one-dot market cards. Discard 40/40/35/30 cards from the one-dot deck. Stack the one-dot deck on top of the two-dot deck. Place the Call to Adventure card under market card 15/23/33/38 from the top of the deck. Form the initial market row by drawing 4/5/6/7 cards from the deck.
Lay out the initiative cards matching the player count in ascending order. The double upward arrow card goes in the highest spot. Place one gold on each initiative card with a gold icon.
Shuffle the fiend deck. Place it near the initiative row. Deal one fiend face up to each initiative card with a fiend slot.
Set aside the combat dice (translucent red and orange-red). All other dice go into the bag. All tokens go in supplies around the table.
Shuffle the two-dot minions. Set them down to form the minion deck. Shuffle the one-dot minions. Discard 18 cards from the one-dot deck, then stack it on top of the minion deck. Flip the top card of the deck face-up.
Choose a starting player. Give them the start player token (red wooden character). Each player takes a character sheet (large cardboard with punched squares) and a familiar board (small cardboard with punched squares). Deal each player an alignment and backstory card, which are placed on the character sheet. Gold is given starting with the first player 5/5/6/7/8.
Deal each player a class card. No players may have class cards with matching colored gems in the bottom right. Give each player the two tracking tokens (colored wooden cubes) that match their class color gem. One cube goes in the center of the alignment card. The other goes on their class color gem.
Each player draws six dice from the bag and rolls them. Each player places these dice following the normal rules, but takes no attribute nor familiar actions.
Choose a 2P+ monster with a color that no player’s class matches. Find that monster’s adventure cards and randomly deal one Location, Obstacle, and Attack facedown near the monster.

Final Scoring
Reputation is earned at the end of the game for the following. Familiar power range, familiar backstory, monster combat, class attribute goals, backstory dice placement, alignment token position, one point per die matching class color, armor cards (scored as sets, not individual cards), and traits.
Tiebreakers are gold, then the fewest number of dice matching the class color.

Tips
●   A player can banish a fiend at any time, even after claiming it before the negative ability takes effect. ●   The familiar row is not an attribute row. Familiar actions are not attribute actions.
●   The familiar row is part of the character sheet.
●   Purchasing a market card will move the alignment token if possible, but isn’t a prerequisite for purchase.
●   Activating a skill will move the alignment token if possible, and is a prerequisite for activation.
●   Max two hand icons worth of weapons may be equipped. Discarding down to two hands is a free action.





Roll Player - All Expansions Summary created by BGG @ XBigTK13X. Version 1.1 - February 07, 2024
Gameplay Phases
1. Character Creation a) Roll
If Call to Adventure hasn’t been revealed in the market deck, then the starting player draws and rolls 6/8/10/12 dice. Arrange the dice in ascending order, placing two dice on each initiative card.
After Call to adventure is revealed, then the starting player draws and rolls 3/4/5/6 dice. Arrange the dice in ascending order, placing one die on each initiative card.
The starting player decides the order for tied dice. b) Dice
Going clockwise beginning with the starting player, select an initiative card. Place your class card’s tracking token on one initiative card. Take the die/dice from that initiative card and place them one at a time on your character sheet. Dice must be placed from left-to-right in any row. Whether one or two dice were placed, select one and optionally activate that attribute’s action. After placing the die/dice, take any gold and/or fiend that is on the initiative card. Placing a gold (yellow) die grants two gold. Filling a row (yellow outline) grants one gold.
c) Market
In ascending Initiative order, players must take one market action. 1.  Purchase one card from the market.
2.  Discard one card from the market and gain two gold. 3.  Go on a hunt against the currently revealed minion.

a.




b. d) Cleanup

May reveal a new minion for three gold (repeatable). Start with one combat die. Add more based on minion rules. May hire mercenaries. Roll combat dice. May reroll using experience. Gain rewards and/or injuries. Discard minions that didn’t reward a trophy. Make a pile of minions near your character sheet that do have a trophy.
First three trophy icons reward adventure tokens L/O/A in that order. Then one experience.

Each player reclaims the class token they placed on the initiative row. Take dice from the initiative cards and put them back in the bag. Place a gold token on any initiative card with a gold symbol that doesn’t currently have a token. Deal a fiend to any initiative card with a fiend slot that doesn’t currently have a fiend card.
Discard all remaining market cards from the market row. Deal 4/5/6/7 cards from the market deck to form the next round’s market row. If the market deck runs out, shuffle the entire discard pile into a new market deck.
Discard unused charisma tokens. Refresh one exhausted skill.
If there are no slots remaining on the character sheet, then the Monster Combat phase begins. Otherwise, start a new Character Creation round in the Roll phase. The next clockwise player takes the start player token.
2. Monster Combat
Each player gets one combat die. Reveal the location, obstacle, and attack cards. Each player that has the matching adventure token resolves the effects. Ties are shared. May hire mercenaries. Each player rolls their combat dice pool. Players may pay experience to reroll dice. Each player declares Final Dice.
Apply the monster’s effect. Each player adds one to their total for each honor token. Subtract one from the total for each injury token. Earn reputation based on combat total compared to monster strength (stars at the bottom of the monster).
