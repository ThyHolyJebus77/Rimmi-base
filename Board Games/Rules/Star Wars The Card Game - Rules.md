## Quick Start Rules Guide

1. Setup:
   - Choose Light Side or Dark Side player
   - Each player takes their side's affiliation card, 3 Force cards, and constructed deck
   - Separate objective cards into an objective deck, shuffle remaining cards as command deck
   - Dark Side sets Death Star dial to 0
   - Each player chooses 3 objectives, places them facedown
   - Draw 6 cards for starting hand
   - Flip objectives faceup, Dark Side first, then Light Side

2. Turn Structure (Dark Side goes first):
   a) Balance Phase: Dark Side advances Death Star dial
   b) Refresh Phase: Remove 1 focus token and all shield tokens from your cards
   c) Draw Phase: Optionally discard 1 card, then draw/discard to 6 cards
   d) Deployment Phase: Play unit and enhancement cards using resources
   e) Conflict Phase: Engage enemy objectives (skip on first Dark Side turn)
   f) Force Phase: Commit units to Force struggle

3. Resources and Playing Cards:
   - Cards have a resource cost in the top left corner
   - To play a card, focus cards with resource icons to generate resources
   - At least one resource must match the affiliation of the card being played

4. Engaging Objectives:
   a) Declare objective and attackers
   b) Opponent declares defenders
   c) Conduct edge battle (reveal cards from hand, highest Force icons wins)
   d) Resolve unit strikes alternately, starting with edge battle winner
   e) Apply damage to units and objectives

5. Striking with Units:
   - Focus unit to strike
   - Resolve combat icons:
     * Unit Damage: Damage enemy unit
     * Tactics: Place focus tokens on enemy units
     * Blast Damage: Damage engaged objective (attackers only)

6. Force Struggle:
   - Commit units by placing Force cards under them
   - In Force Phase, compare Force icons on ready committed units
   - Winner flips Balance of the Force token to their side

7. Winning the Game:
   - Light Side: Destroy 3 Dark Side objectives
   - Dark Side: Advance Death Star dial to 12
   - Either side: Opponent's command or objective deck is empty

Remember:
- Focused (exhausted) cards have focus tokens and can't be used again until refreshed
- Damaged cards are destroyed when damage equals or exceeds damage capacity
- Shield tokens can prevent 1 damage or 1 focus token

This guide should help new players get started with their first game. Refer to the full rulebook for detailed explanations and edge cases.

## Factions/Civilizations
**Light Side:** Rebel Alliance, Smugglers and Spies, Jedi
**Dark Side:** Imperial Navy, Scum and Villainy, Sith
Each faction has unique cards and strategies, but gameplay differences are primarily between Light and Dark Sides rather than individual factions.

## Additional Notes
The game uses a unique objective set system for deck-building, where players choose sets of 6 cards (1 objective + 5 others) to construct their decks. This ensures thematic consistency and balanced gameplay while allowing for customization.

# Star Wars: The Card Game - Rules
#### SETUP

One player fights for the **Light Side of the Force** (LS) and the
other the **Dark Side of the Force** (DS).

Each side recruits its allies from 3 different affiliations: the
**rebel alliance** , **smugglers and spies** , and **Jedi** (LS), and the
**imperial navy** , **scum and villainy** , and **Sith** (DS). Non-affiliated
cards are **neutral**. A player’s deck is constructed from **objective
sets,** each made up of 6 cards: one **objective** card and 5 others
( **unit** , **event** , **fate** , or **enhancement** cards).

Each player takes his side’s 3 **Force** cards and his constructed
deck, then places his **affiliation** card before him (this card is
always in play and may be referenced by card abilities).

Place the **Balance of the Force** token in the game area with its
**light side faceup**. All **focus** , **damage** , and **shield** tokens form
the **token pool**.

Remove all objective cards from your deck and shuffle them
facedown into a separate **objective deck**. Your remaining cards
form your **command deck**. If you are instructed to _draw_ cards
you do so from your command deck, and any reference to your
_deck_ means this deck, unless stated otherwise.

The DS player sets the Death Star dial to **0**.

Secretly look at the top 4 cards of your objective deck, select 3,
and place the fourth facedown at the bottom of the deck. Then
place your 3 chosen objective cards facedown in your play area.

Shuffles your command deck and draw the top 6 cards to
create your starting hand. If players agree, you may shuffle
your cards back into your deck and draw a new starting hand
_(“taking a mulligan”),_ which you must keep.

The DS player puts his 3 chosen objective cards into play one
at a time by flipping them faceup in the order of his choosing,
resolving any relevant _interrupt_ or _reaction_ card effects on one
card before putting the next into play. Then the LS player does
the same with his 3 chosen objective cards. The 3 objective
cards faceup in your play area are your **current objective** cards.

Any text on a card or in the rules that uses the word _“cannot”_
is absolute and cannot be countermanded by another effect.
Otherwise, when text on a card directly contradicts the text in
the rules, the card takes precedence.

**Focus** You may **focus** one of your cards—to perform an ability
or take some other action—by placing a **focus token** on it. A
card without focus tokens is **ready** ; one with one or more focus
tokens is **exhausted**. You cannot focus an exhausted card.

If card abilities or game rules require focus tokens to be placed
on a card, this does not cause the card to focus, but it does
cause it to become exhausted.

**Discarding** means removing a card from your hand, deck,
or play area and placing it faceup on the top of your
command deck discard pile. If multiple cards are discarded
simultaneously, choose the order in which they are placed in
the discard pile.

A discarded Force card is returned to your supply of available
Force cards. Discarded or removed tokens are returned to the
token pool.

#### THE GAME ROUND

```
The DS player always takes the first turn of the game.
Players take alternating turns.
```
#### 1. BALANCE PHASE

```
The DS player is the active player:
Advance the Death Star dial by 1 point. If the Balance of the
Force token is dark side faceup, advance it 1 additional point.
```
```
The LS player is the active player:
If the Balance of the Force token is light side faceup, you may
deal 1 damage to any one DS current objective. If this destroys
the objective card, places it in your victory pile.
```
#### 2. REFRESH PHASE

1. **Remove 1 focus token** from each card in your play area.
_During his first turn only, the LS player skips this step._
2. **Remove all shield tokens** from each card in your play area.
3. **If you have fewer than 3 current objective cards** , replace each
    missing card with a card from your objective deck. If a card
    just put into play has a _“When this card enters play ...”_ (or
    similar) effect, immediately resolve it.

```
Any effect with the text “after you refresh” can now be used.
```
#### 3. DRAW PHASE

```
You may choose 1 card in your hand and discard it. Then you
must return your hand to a number of cards equal to your
current reserve value, drawing from your deck or choosing and
discarding from your hand as necessary.
```
```
At the start of the game, each player’s reserve value is 6.
```
#### 4. DEPLOYMENT PHASE

```
You may play as many unit and enhancement cards from your
hand as you can afford. A card played must be paid for by
paying its resource cost , or if cannot be played.
```
```
Each time you play a unit or enhancement card, it is an action.
Each action must be fully resolved before the next can begin.
```
```
When a card enters play, it is immediately eligible to perform
any permitted game function that same turn.
```
```
Unit cards are always played faceup into your play area.
```
```
Enhancement cards usually enhance unit cards, but other game
elements can be enhanced (see the card’s text).
```
```
An enhancement card with the text “Enhance [card type],” is
placed partially beneath a card in play of the specified type,
keeping the enhancement card is visible; the enhancement
card is now attached to that card.
When a card leaves play, any enhancements attached to it are
immediately discarded to their owner’s discard pile. There is no
limit to the number of enhancements that can be attached to a
card or game element.
```
```
An enhancement that enhances a play area is placed faceup in
the specified player’s play area. An enhancement instructing its
player to enhance something not in play cannot be played.
```
#### 5. CONFLICT PHASE

```
You may engage one or more of the enemy’s current objective
cards, one at a time.
During his first turn, the DS player skips this entire phase.
```
```
You may decide to not engage and instead proceed directly to
the Force phase.
```
```
Each engagement is declared and resolved one at a time, and
each current enemy objective card may only be engaged once
per turn. After each engagement, you may engage another
current enemy objective card. If you don’t, or if you’ve already
engaged each current enemy objective card, this phase ends.
```
#### 6. FORCE PHASE

**1. Force Commitment**
You may **commit** any unit cards in your play area to the Force
(except for a unit card already committed to the Force).
To commit a unit, take one of your available Force cards and
place it underneath the unit card. When a unit committed to
the Force leaves play, the attached Force card is returned to its
owner’s supply of available Force cards.

```
Force cards are not considered “cards” and are never “in play.”
They only identify which units are committed to the Force.
```
```
After you have attached all of your 3 Force cards to your units,
you cannot commit additional units to the Force until one or
more of your Force cards become available. You are strictly
limited to 3 Force cards.
```
```
After a unit is committed to the Force, it is able to participate
in a Force struggle. When the unit is focused to strike during an
engagement (as an attacker or a defender), it receives 2 focus
tokens instead of one.
```
```
A unit committed to the Force remains committed as long as
it is in play; you may not voluntarily remove Force cards from
your units.
```
**2. Force Struggle**
Each player now adds the number of **Force icons** on his ready
units that are committed to the Force to find his **force total**.

```
The player with the highest Force total flips the Balance of the
Force token so that his side of the Force is faceup. On a tie, the
token remains as it is.
```
```
Force icons on enhancements are not counted towards a
player’s Force total, even if an enhancement is attached to a
unit that is committed to the Force. Count only the Force icons
on the unit card itself.
After you complete your Force phase, your turn is over, and your
opponent begins a new turn.
```
```
While playing the game, the Balance of the Force is with the
side that is currently faceup on the Balance of the Force token.
```
#### WINNING THE GAME

```
The LS player wins the game immediately when:
```
- 3 or more DS objective cards are destroyed.
- The DS player must draw a card from his command deck
    or objective deck, but that deck is empty.

```
The DS player wins the game immediately when:
```
- The Death Star dial advances to 12.
- The LS player must draw a card from his command deck
    or objective deck, but that deck is empty.

#### RESOURCES

```
When you wish to play a card or are required to spend resources
to execute an ability, reveal the card or ability to your opponent,
then generate the required number of resources from one or
more ready , resource-providing cards in your play area to pay
the resource cost (upper left corner).
```
```
Your affiliation card, objective cards, and some unit and
enhancement cards have a resource value (the number inside
the card’s resource icon) and can generate resources.
```

Generate resources by placing **focus tokens** on the card up to
its resource value (one resource for each focus token placed).
You may generate resources from multiple ready and resource-
providing cards in your play area. Cards with focus tokens are
_exhausted_ ; you may not generate resources from an exhausted
card.

After generating sufficient resources, play the card you revealed
or execute the ability you designated. **The generated resources
cannot pay for multiple cards or abilities**. Any resources
generated in excess of the resource cost are lost.

If you cannot generate enough resources to pay the cost, the
card cannot be played (it returns to your hand) nor the ability
executed.

When playing a card from your hand, at least one of the cards
used to generate the resources _must match the affiliation of the
card being played_. This is called a **resource match**.

Neutral cards, or cards with a resource cost of **0** , do not require
a resource match. Neutral resource-providing cards do not
qualify as a resource match for any affiliation.

#### RESOLVING AN ENGAGEMENT

When the active player engages an enemy objective card,
resolve the following engagement steps:

## 1. Declare Objective

Declare which one of your enemy’s current objective cards you
will engage. Each enemy objective may be engaged only **once
per conflict phase**. If you have already engaged all of your
enemy’s current objectives this phase, you must proceed to the
Force phase.

## 2. Declare Attackers

Declare which of your ready units will engage. Push these
**attackers** towards the middle of the table.

At least one unit must be declared as an attacker, or you
cannot initiate an engagement.

## 3. Declare Defenders

The defending player declares which of his ready units will
engage. Push these **defenders** towards the middle of the table.

The defending player has the option to declare no defenders.

Any unit card that has been declared as either an attacker
or a defender during an engagement is **participating** in the
engagement until it is removed from the engagement, leaves
play, or all steps of the engagement are complete.

## 4. Fight Edge Battle

The winner of the **edge battle** makes the first strike during the
Resolve Strikes step of the engagement, and is able to use the
white-framed **edge-enabled combat icons** on his striking units.

You must control at least one participating unit to place
cards in the edge battle. If the defending player controls no
defending units, the attacking player automatically wins the
edge battle (although he may still place cards into the edge
battle if he wishes).

**1. Place Edge Cards**
The attacker may place one card facedown from his hand in
front of him, forming his **edge stack** ; or he may pass. The
defender then has the same options.

Players alternate, each placing one card facedown into his edge
stack or passing, until both consecutively pass.

You may place any card from your hand into your edge stack,
ignoring its cost or affiliation. Fate cards can only be placed
into an edge stack; they have no other function.

**2. Reveal Edge Stacks**
Both edge stacks are simultaneously revealed. Except for fate
cards and all Force icons, the cards placed in an edge stack are
considered blank cards (cards with no attributes, costs, effects,
text, or affiliation).
**3. Resolve Fate Cards**
In ascending order (lowest to highest) of priority number, each
player resolves the effects of fate cards in his edge stack.

```
If the priority number of two or more fate cards are equal, the
attacker decides the order in which they are resolved.
```
```
The effect of each fate card must be fully resolved before the
resolution of the next fate card begins.
```
**4. Finishing the Edge Battle**
Each player counts the number of Force icons on cards in his
edge stack. The player with the higher total wins the edge
battle and has the edge for the remainder of the engagement.
On a tie, the edge goes to the defender. Each player then
discards the cards he placed into his edge stack.

## 5. Resolve Strikes

```
Starting with the player with the edge, each player in turn
focuses one of his participating ready units to strike. Resolve
each strike fully before the next strike begins.
```
```
Then his opponent focuses one of his ready participating units
to strike. Players alternate, focusing a unit and resolving its
strike, until no participating ready unit remains.
You may not pass during this step; if you have at least one
ready participating unit, it must focus to strike.
If all of your participating ready units are exhausted, but your
opponent’s are not, the opponent continues to focus and strike
with his ready participating units, resolving one strike at a time,
until all participating units are exhausted.
```
```
Resolving a Strike
```
**1.** Choose one of your participating ready units.
**2.** Focus the unit to strike (place a focus token on the card).
**3.** Resolve the striking unit’s combat icons by type, in an order
    of your choice. The number of icons of a type is the card’s
    **icon strength** of that icon type.

```
Unit Damage: Chooses one participating enemy unit
and deal damage to that unit equal to the strength
of the striking unit.
```
```
Tactics: Place a number of focus tokens equal to
the strength of the striking unit, on enemy units.
Multiple tokens may be placed on the same unit, or
on different units in any combination. The unit(s)
can be any controlled by the opposing player, not
just his participating units.
```
```
Blast Damage: If the striking player is attacking,
he deals an amount of damage to the engaged
enemy objective equal to the strength of the
striking unit. If the striking unit is defending, its
icon type does not resolve.
```
```
When a card receives damage, place damage tokens on it equal
to amount of damage received. When a card has damage tokens
with value equal to or greater than its damage capacity, it is
immediately destroyed. Excess damage is ignored.
```
```
Destroyed Unit Cards
A destroyed unit is placed faceup on its owner’s discard pile.
Any cards that were attached to it are placed in their respective
owners’ discard piles. If a destroyed unit card was committed
to the Force, return its Force card to its owner’s available Force
cards.
```
```
Destroyed Objectives
When one of your current objective cards is destroyed, place
it in your opponent’s victory pile. Your victory pile tracks how
many of your opponent’s objective cards have been destroyed.
```
```
Immediately after an LS objective card is placed in the DS
victory pile, the DS player advances the Death Star dial 1 point
for each LS objective card in his victory pile. If the dial reaches
12 or higher, the DS player immediately wins the game.
Immediately after a DS objective card is placed in the LS
victory pile, the LS player counts the number of cards in his
victory pile. When the LS player has 3 or more DS objective
cards in his victory pile, he immediately wins the game.
```
```
Any captured cards attached to a destroyed objective are
rescued and returned to their owner’s hand.
```
```
Shield Tokens
Some effects place a shield token on units or objectives. A
shield token may not be assigned to a card that already has one.
A player may discard a card’s shield token to prevent 1 damage
or 1 focus token that would be placed on the shielded card by
an attack or an enemy effect.
```
## 6. Reward Unopposed

```
Any participating unit (attacking or defending) that has not
been destroyed by the end of the Resolve Strikes step has
survived the engagement. If at least one attacking unit has
survived, and there are no surviving defenders, this is an
unopposed engagement and the attacking player deals 1 bonus
damage to the engaged objective card (an unopposed bonus ).
```
```
If the engaged objective was destroyed before the Reward
Unopposed step, there is no unopposed bonus.
```
```
Play now returns to the active player’s conflict phase. He may
initiate a new engagement against a different enemy objective
or continue to the Force phase of his turn.
```
#### CAPTURE AND RESCUE

```
When the DS player captures a card, only LS cards can be
captured. Attach the captured card facedown to the DS
objective designated in the effect’s text. If no DS objective is
specified, the DS player may choose which of his objectives the
captured card is attached to.
```
```
Discard the captured card’s tokens, enhancements, and return
its Force card (if any) to its owner’s supply. The card has no
characteristics, and is considered solely a captured card until
rescued or discarded.
```
```
If a DS objective card with one or more attached captured
cards is destroyed, the captured cards are rescued and returned
to their owner’s hand.
When a card effect instructs the LS player to rescue a captured
card, he chooses a DS objective and randomly selects one
captured card there to return to his hand.
```
#### CUSTOM DECKS

```
To build a custom deck, choose an affiliation card as the deck’s
foundation. Then choose at least 10 eligible objective sets to
form the deck. A deck must be built for either LS or DS play.
There is no maximum number of objective sets you may include
in your deck. Any objective set may be included twice in a
constructed deck unless its objective card states ‘limit one per
objective deck’.
```
```
The affiliation of an objective set does not need to match your
affiliation card, unless the set’s objective card text includes
‘[name of] affiliation only’. However objective sets must still
belong to the side that matches your affiliation card. Neutral
objective sets may also be used for custom decks.
```

#### 1. BALANCE PHASE

**DS turn only:** Increase Death Star dial.

**DS Balance:** Increase Death Star dial (DS turn only).

**LS Balance:** Damage 1 DS objective (LS turn only).

#### 2. REFRESH PHASE

Active player:

- removes 1 focus token from each card he controls.
- removes all shield tokens from each card he
    controls.
- replaces each of his missing objectives.

#### RETURN TO CONFLICT PHASE


#### CARD ABILITIES

All card abilities fall into one of the following
types: **constant effects** , **actions** , **traits** , **interrupts** ,
**reactions** , and **keywords**.

Specific timing rules for card abilities must be
observed, but card abilities can usually be executed
both during a player’s and his opponent’s turn.

Many **event cards** may be played at any time, even
during an opponent’s turn. Pay the card’s resource
cost (if any), execute its ability, then discard it

**Constant Effects**
Cards that announce an effect with no bold
precursor are **constant effects** , and become active as
soon as the card comes into play and remain active
as long as it is in play.

**Actions**
Action abilities are labelled with the word **Action**
followed by effect text. An action may be initiated by
a player during any **action window**.

The active player has the option to initiate the first
action during an action window, followed by his
opponent. Players take one action at a time until
both consecutively pass and the action window
closes.

**Traits**
A trait (at the top of the text box and in italics) has
no inherent effect, but grants its card an attribute
that may be referenced by other effects.

**Interrupts**

Interrupt abilities are labelled by the word **Interrupt**
followed by effect text. Interrupts may be executed
when the specified triggering condition occurs.

Multiple interrupts (and reaction abilities) may
be executed from the same triggering condition.
Resolve interrupts before resolving the effects of the
triggering condition itself.

The active player has the option to resolve the first
interrupt to a triggering condition, followed by his
opponent. Players execute one interrupt at a time
until both consecutively pass. Resolve each interrupt
completely before the next.

An interrupt effect is resolved before the triggering
condition is allowed to complete—often cancelling
or changing the outcome of the triggering condition.

```
A card’s interrupt effect may only be resolved once
per triggering condition.
```
```
Reactions
Reaction abilities are labelled by the word Reaction
followed by effect text. Reactions may only be
resolved after a specified triggering condition
occurs. Reactions are played after the effects of the
triggering condition have resolved.
```
```
The active player has the option to resolve the first
reaction to a triggering condition, followed by his
opponent. Players execute one reaction at a time
until both consecutively pass. Resolve each reaction
completely before the next.
```
```
A card’s reaction effect may only be resolved once
per triggering condition.
```
```
Forced
Some interrupt and reaction effects are preceded by
the word Forced and must be resolved immediately
whenever their specified trigger occurs.
```
```
Keywords
A keyword is an attribute which conveys specific
rules to its card. Some are followed by reminder text
in italics.
Edge (x) The value is the number of additional Force
icons the card’s controller counts in an edge battle
resolved during an engagement in which the card
with this keyword participates.
```
```
Elite This card removes one additional focus token
from itself (if able) when it refreshes during the
refresh phase.
```
```
Limited A player can play only one card with this
keyword during each turn. Non-fate cards placed
into an edge stack during an edge battle are not
considered ‘played’ and have no attributes or text
(other than their Force icons).
```
```
No Enhancements This card cannot have
enhancement cards attached to it. A Force card is
not an enhancement.
```
```
Protect [Trait] This card may take damage instead
of any friendly card in play with the specified trait.
Damage beyond a protecting unit’s remaining
damage capacity may not be re-assigned to the
protecting unit. A shield does not change the
amount of damage you can transfer via this keyword.
```
```
Shielding When this card is declared as either
attacker or defender, its controller may immediately
place one shield token on any friendly unshielded
participating unit, or to the engaged objective card,
if unshielded.
```
```
Targeted Strike When this card strikes during an
engagement as an attacker, damage from its
icon type may be assigned to one target enemy unit
card, even if that unit is not participating in the
engagement.
```
