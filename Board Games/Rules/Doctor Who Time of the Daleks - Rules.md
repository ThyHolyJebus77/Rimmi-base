# Doctor Who: Time of the Daleks - Rules
#### SETUP

Players select a TARDIS console, TARDIS miniature, a Doctor
card, and the matching Doctor marker. Pick a colour, and place
bases of that colour on your Doctor and TARDIS miniatures.

Place the linked companion card (listed on your Doctor’s card)
on your TARDIS Console.

Shuffle both companion decks and set them to the side.

Place 2 sonic charge tokens on your TARDIS console.

Shuffle the timey-wimey cards and deal each player 2 cards.

Place the web of time board in the middle of the table.

Separately shuffle the locations and dilemmas and place 1
facedown dilemma in each of the 3 slots on the web of time
board.

Place each player's TARDIS miniature on the Earth space on the
web of time board.

Place 4 time anomaly markers on the VI, IX, XII, and XV spaces
on the web of time board.

Place the Dalek ship on the Skaro space on the web of time
board.

Shuffle and place the time anomaly deck to the right of the
player with the earliest regeneration of the Doctor.

Place the other game components between players to keep
the centre of the table (around the web of time board) free for
locations.

#### GAME TURN

Starting with the earliest regeneration of the Doctor and moving
clockwise, each player takes their turn. After all players have
had a turn, the Daleks have a turn.

#### 1. PREPARE

######## 1. SONIC CHARGE TOKENS

Place 2 additional sonic charge tokens on your TARDIS console
(up to a maximum of 5 tokens). You must do this before you use
any timey-wimey or companion card effects.

######## 2. UNINSTALL EQUIPMENT

Discard any unwanted equipment timey-wimey cards from your
TARDIS console, freeing up equipment slots for other equipment
cards.

######## 3. INSTALL EQUIPMENT

Play equipment timey-wimey cards from your hand into empty
equipment slots on your TARDIS console. You must pay any
sonic cost of the equipment card when you install it (you do not
need to pay the cost to use the card after that).

######## 4. DISMISS COMPANIONS

Dismiss any unwanted companions from your TARDIS console
and shuffle them back into their companion decks.

#### 2. TRAVEL

```
You may either:
a. Stay at your current location if there is an unsolved dilemma
there, or
b. Move to another location in play or a new location.
```
######## MOVE TO A NEW LOCATION

```
If you wish to move to a location other than Earth or a time
anomaly, roll the TARDIS die.
```
```
On a roll of , you may either:
a. Move your Doctor to any time zone on any location in play, or
```
```
b. Draw 2 location tiles. Discard one and place the new location
tile on the table. Move your Doctor to one of the time zones
on the new location.
On a roll of , draw a location tile and place it on the table,
then move your Doctor to one of the time zones on that location.
Whenever you place a new location tile, draw 2 dilemma cards,
and without looking at them, place them facedown in the slots
on the location tile.
```
```
Flip the dilemma in the time zone your Doctor is in faceup.
```
#### 3. ADVENTURE

######## A. RECRUIT A COMPANION

```
If you have an empty companion space on your TARDIS console,
you may recruit a companion at the start of your adventure.
Discard a timey-wimey card or a sonic charge token, and draw
a companion card.
If you are on Earth, draw from the Earth companion deck. If
not, draw from the alien companion deck. If you are on a time
anomaly, you may recruit a companion from either deck.
```
```
The newly-recruited companion card is a part-time companion,
and will only become a fulltime companion if you succeed
in the adventure. Indicate this by leaving a gap between the
companion card and the TARDIS console.
```
```
If you have a link to a companion you may search the
companion deck for that companion to recruit, instead of
drawing at random. After searching, shuffle the companion
deck.
```
```
Doctors, and some companion cards, have links to other
companions. You may only use these links if you are at the
appropriate type of location.
```
```
A link to an Earth companion can only be used on Earth, while
a link to an alien companion cannot be used on Earth. If a link
is to a group of companions (eg. UNIT), you may use the link to
recruit any member of the group.
If a location or dilemma is linked to a companion, you may
search either deck for that companion.
```
######## B. DETERMINE THE CHALLENGE

```
The combined symbols on the location and dilemma set the
challenge you need to meet to complete the adventure.
```
```
The colours on the tiles advise you on which story dice are most
likely to roll that symbol, but it doesn’t matter which colour of
dice you end up using, as long as you roll the required symbols.
```
######## C. CREATE THE DICE POOL

```
Starting dice pool
```
#### +

```
The total dice add icons on all your Doctor, companion,
and equipment timey-wimey cards. You may play event
and transfer timey-wimey cards to get more dice.
```
```
Gather the matching story dice and place them in the top dice
pool area of your TARDIS console.
```
```
Focusing dice
Each dice focus icon on a companion card allows
you to exchange a die of that colour for one of your
black dice.
```
```
A dice focus icon with a split colour gives you a choice
of exchanging a die of either colour for a black die.
```
```
Discard down to 8 dice
If, after adding and focussing dice, you end up with more then 8
dice, you must discard any in excess.
```
```
Dilemmas and time anomalies that have a time breach
reduce the maximum dice pool to 7 dice.
```
```
The dice pool is also limited to a maximum of 3 blue, 3 green,
and 3 red dice.
Exterminate dice
The Doctor must then exterminate (discard) a further die for
each Dalek marker at the Doctor’s current location (regardless
of which time zone the Dalek marker is in).However, if the
Doctor is on Earth, only Daleks in the same time zone as the
Doctor exterminate dice from his dice pool.
```
######## D. ROLL THE DICE

```
Roll your dice pool and compare it to the challenge. You may
wish to place the dice on the challenge as you go to help you
keep track of your progress. If you can match the symbols set
by the challenge, you have succeeded in this adventure: move
straight to resolving it.
```
```
Re-roll dice
If you fail to roll all the symbols needed on the initial roll, you
may re-roll some of them as follows. Story dice may be re-rolled
more than once if you have the ability to do so.
```
```
Card abilities: Some Doctors, companions, and timey-wimey
cards have dice re-roll icons which grant you re-rolls of dice
of their indicated colour. Each may only be used once per
adventure.
```
(^) **1**
NUMBER: You may re-roll up to that number of dice of the
indicated colour.
ANY
ANY: You may re-roll any or all dice of the indicated colour.
ALL
ALL: You may re-roll all (but not anything less) dice of the
indicated colour.
Sonic charge tokens: You may spend 2 sonic charge tokens to
re-roll any 1 die. You may do this as many times as you have
tokens to spend on doing so.
Discarding a black die: You may discard a black die (reducing
the size of your dice pool) to re-roll all of your dice. This can be
done as many times as you have black dice to discard.
Dilemmas and time anomalies that are fixed points prevent
you from using card abilities or sonic charge tokens to re-
roll dice (you can still discard a black die to re-roll).
Change facing
If after re-rolling you still have not rolled all of the required
symbols, you may change the facing on some of your dice using
card abilities, or sonic charge tokens.
Card abilities: Some Doctors, companions, and timey-
wimey cards have dice change face icons. These
allow you to change the facing of a die of the
indicated colour to the indicated symbol. Each may
only be used once per adventure.
Sonic charge tokens: You may spend 3 sonic charge tokens to
change the facing of any 1 die to any symbol. You may do this as
many times as you have tokens to spend on doing so.

## TIME OF THE DALEKS


```
Dilemmas and time anomalies that are time locked prevent
you from using card abilities or sonic charge tokens to
change the facings of dice.
```
######## E. RESOLVE THE ADVENTURE

When a Doctor succeeds in an adventure by matching all the
symbols in the challenge, they:

1. Discard the dilemma.
2. Gain the reward given by the time zone they are in.
3. Remove 1 Dalek marker from this location (if there are any).
    If they are on Earth, only remove a Dalek marker if it is in their
    time zone.
4. Promote all part-time companions to full-time companions by
    moving them up to connect with the TARDIS console.

When a Doctor fails an adventure because they were unable to
match all the symbols in the challenge, they:

1. Dismiss all part-time companions and shuffle them back into
    their companion decks.
2. Add 1 Dalek marker on this location. If they are on Earth,
    place the Dalek marker in their time zone.
3. Complete the actions listed as the fail cost on the dilemma.

Some dilemmas give you a choice of fail costs. You may choose
either option, but you may not choose an option that requires
you to discard cards or tokens that you do not have.

Discard a companion: Remove the card from your TARDIS and
place it in the discard pile.

Dismiss a companion: Remove the companion from your
TARDIS and shuffle the card back into the appropriate deck.

###### 4. FINISH

At the end of your turn:

1. Discard any locations, other than Earth, that do not have a
    Dalek or Doctor marker on them.
2. Draw a new dilemma tile for any empty slot on Earth.
3. If you have more than 4 timey-wimey cards in your hand,
    discard down to 4.
4. Pass the TARDIS die to the next player.

###### CALL FOR HELP

If you don’t think you will be able to complete the challenge on
your own, you may choose to call in help from another Doctor
during the create the dice pool stage of the adventure step.

To do so, discard a sonic charge token or timey-wimey card and
choose another player to help you. That player now chooses to
either help you from afar or come to your location.

If the helping Doctor decides to help you from your location, and
is not already at your current location, the helping Doctor must
discard a sonic charge token or timey-wimey card to move their
Doctor to your time zone and location.

Unless the location is a time-anomaly, whenever a Doctor helps
another at the same location, you must move the Dalek ship
forward 2 spaces.

######## SPLITTING THE DICE POOL

You must split your dice pool with the helping Doctor, allowing
you each to focus on part of the challenge.

Each Doctor may only use their own Doctor, companion, and
equipment cards on their own dice pool (unless it is an Any
Adventure timey-wimey card, which can be used on either
Doctor’s dice pool).

```
If a Doctor discards a black die to re-roll all their dice, they only
roll their own dice pool. The other Doctor must discard their own
black die to re-roll their dice pool as well.
```
```
If any dice are exterminated from the dice pool, the Doctor
being helped chooses which die will be discarded.
```
######## HELP FROM AFAR

```
If the helping Doctor decides to help you from afar:
```
- The helping Doctor has a dice pool of 1 die.
- The Doctor who is being helped has a dice pool of 7 dice, or
    6 dice if the dilemma or time anomaly has the time-breach
    condition.

```
If you succeed in the adventure, the helping Doctor draws 1
timey-wimey card.
```
```
If you fail the adventure, the helping Doctor must discard 1
sonic charge token or timey-wimey card.
```
######## HELP AT YOUR LOCATION

```
If the helping Doctor comes to your location:
```
- The helping Doctor has a dice pool of 3 dice.
- The Doctor who is being helped has a dice pool of 5 dice, or
    4 dice if the dilemma or time anomaly has the time-breach
    condition.

```
If you succeed in the adventure, The helping Doctor also gains
the reward given by the time zone they are in on their location.
Also, remove an additional Dalek marker from this location. If
they are on earth, they only remove an additional Dalek marker
if it is in their time zone.
If you fail the adventure, add an additional Dalek marker on this
location. If they are on Earth, place the additional Dalek marker
in the their time zone. Also, complete the actions listed as the
fail cost on the dilemma tile for the helping Doctor as well as the
Doctor being helped.
```
###### DALEK TURN

```
After the last Doctor has had their turn, the Daleks have a turn.
```
######## 1. ADVANCE DALEK SHIP

```
Move the Dalek ship forward 1 space on the web of time track.
```
######## 2. HAVE THE DALEKS WON?

```
The Daleks win and the game ends if the Dalek ship has reached
Gallifrey (the last space on the web of time track) or there are 3
Dalek markers on Earth.
```
######## 3. HAS A DOCTOR WON?

```
If the Daleks did not win, any Doctor that has reached Gallifrey
wins.
```
```
If neither the Daleks nor the Doctor have won, another round
begins.
```
```
If a TARDIS or the Dalek ship is required to move forward past
the Gallifrey space, it stops its movement on the Gallifrey space.
```
###### TIME ANOMALIES

```
Any time the Dalek ship lands on or moves through a space
containing a time anomaly marker, remove the time anomaly
marker and draw a time anomaly card.
```
######## LOCATION TIME ANOMALIES

```
Some time anomalies function as locations. When the time
anomaly is drawn, take the actions listed in its effect section.
Unlike normal locations, time anomalies:
```
- Do not have dilemma cards. The challenge is always the same.
- Do not require Doctors to roll the TARDIS dice when travelling
    to them.
       - Allow Doctors to recruit their companions from either the
          earth or alien companion deck.
       - Do not receive Dalek markers when a Doctor fails their
          challenge.

```
Once the challenge is completed, the time anomaly is discarded
and all Doctors at its location are moved to their TARDIS
consoles.
```
######## TASK TIME ANOMALIES

```
Ta s k time anomaly cards change the rules in some way until the
doctors complete a series of tasks.
```
```
Some task time anomalies imprison story dice. Place the
imprisoned dice on the time anomaly. They cannot be used until
they are freed. Others require a number of progress markers to
end their effect.
Each time a task is completed, place a progress marker on
the time anomaly card or free a die, removing it from the card.
Once the card’s tasks are completed, its effects end and it is
discarded.
```
######## INSTANT TIME ANOMALIES

```
These have an immediate effect and are then discarded.
```
###### WINNING AND LOSING

```
A Doctor wins the game if they are on the Gallifrey space at the
end of the Dalek turn and the Dalek ship is not.
```
```
The Doctors lose the game if:
```
- There are already 6 Dalek markers in play (the sixth and
    final Dalek marker should be Davros) when a seventh Dalek
    marker is required to be placed.
- The Daleks have 3 Daleks on Earth in the Dalek turn.
- The Dalek ship is on the Gallifrey space in the Dalek turn.

###### REGENERATION

```
When the Doctors are forced to regenerate, each player takes
the next highest numbered Doctor card available, passing on
their old Doctor card to another player if necessary.
```
```
If you are already at the highest-numbered Doctor available, you
regenerate as the First Doctor.
```
```
Remove your old Doctor marker from your coloured base and
replace it with the Doctor marker for your new regeneration,
placing it where your previous Doctor marker was.

    Dalek marker in their time zone.
3. Complete the actions listed as the fail cost on the dilemma.

###### 4. FINISH

```
At the end of your turn:
```
1. Discard any locations, other than Earth, that do not have a
    Dalek or Doctor marker on them.
2. Draw a new dilemma tile for any empty slot on Earth.
3. If you have more than 4 timey-wimey cards in your hand,
    discard down to 4.
4. Pass the TARDIS die to the next player.

###### DALEK TURN

```
After the last Doctor has had their turn, the Daleks have a turn.
```
######## 1. ADVANCE DALEK SHIP

```
Move the Dalek ship forward 1 space on the web of time track.
```
######## 2. HAVE THE DALEKS WON?

```
The Daleks win if the Dalek ship has reached Gallifrey or there
are 3 Dalek markers on Earth.
```
######## 3. HAS A DOCTOR WON?

```
If the Daleks did not win, any Doctor that has reached Gallifrey
wins.
```
###### TIME ANOMALIES

```
Any time the Dalek ship lands on or moves through a space
containing a time anomaly marker, remove the marker and draw
a time anomaly card.
```
```
Location: Unlike normal locations, these time anomalies:
```
- Do not have dilemma cards. The challenge is always the same.
- Do not require Doctors to roll the TARDIS dice when travelling
    to them.
- Allow Doctors to recruit their companions from either the
    earth or alien companion deck.
- Do not receive Dalek markers when a Doctor fails their
    challenge.

```
Once the challenge is completed, the time anomaly is discarded
and all Doctors at its location are moved to their TARDIS.
```
```
Task: These change the rules until the doctors complete a series
of tasks. Some imprison story dice: place the imprisoned dice
on the time anomaly; they cannot be used until they are freed.
Others require a number of progress markers to end their effect.
Instant: These have an immediate effect, then are discarded.
```
###### WINNING AND LOSING

```
A Doctor wins the game if they are on the Gallifrey space at the
end of the Dalek turn and the Dalek ship is not.
```
```
The Doctors lose if:
```
- There are already 6 Dalek markers in play (the sixth one is
    Davros) when a seventh Dalek marker must be placed.
- The Daleks have 3 Daleks on Earth in the Dalek turn.
- The Dalek ship is on the Gallifrey space in the Dalek turn.

```
Fixed points prevent you from using card abilities or sonic
charge tokens to re-roll dice (you can still discard a black
die to re-roll).
```
Change facing

```
Card abilities: Dice change face icons allow you to
change the facing of a die of the indicated colour to
the indicated symbol. Each may only be used once per
adventure.
```
Sonic charge tokens: You may spend 3 tokens to change the
facing of any 1 die to any symbol (you may do this as many times
as you wish).

```
Time locked challenges prevent you from using card abilities
or sonic charge tokens to change dice facings.
```
######## E. RESOLVE THE ADVENTURE

When a Doctor succeeds:

1. Discard the dilemma.
2. Gain the reward given by the time zone.
3. Remove 1 Dalek marker from this location (if there are any).
    If on Earth, only remove a Dalek marker if in their time zone.
4. Promote all part-time companions to full-time companions.

When a Doctor fails:

1. Dismiss all part-time companions.
