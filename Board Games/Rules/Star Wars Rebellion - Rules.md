# Star Wars Rebellion - Rules

## SETUP

Choose who controls the Imperials and who controls the Rebels.

Take your faction’s miniatures, leaders, loyalty markers, faction
sheet, mission cards, and action cards.

Each player takes their 4 starting leaders (no recruit icon) and
places them in the Leader Pool box on their faction sheet. Place all
leaders with recruit icons near the board.

Assemble the board and place the time marker on space 1 of
the track and the reputation marker on space 14.

Sort the objective cards into 3 piles (I, II, and III), and shuffle each
pile individually. Create the objective deck by placing pile III on
the Objectives space on the board; then pile II on the top of pile III,
then pile I on top of pile II.

The Rebel player draws 1 card from the objective deck, keeping it
secret from the Imperial player.

Each player takes all of their action cards with a recruit icon
and shuffles them to create their action deck. Place your deck
facedown next to the Action Deck side of your faction sheet.

Shuffle the space tactic and ground tactic decks individually and
place them with all remaining markers and dice near the board.

Each player sets aside their 4 starting mission cards (curved arrow
at the bottom).

The Imperial player shuffles the project mission cards (white star)
and places them on the Project space on the board.

Each player shuffles their remaining mission cards to create their
mission deck, and places it facedown next to the Mission Deck
side of their faction sheet.

Shuffle the probe deck and draw cards from the top of the deck
until 3 Rebel systems and 5 Imperial systems have been revealed.
Place a Rebel loyalty marker in each of the 3 Rebel systems. Place
a subjugation marker in the first 2 Imperial systems drawn and an
Imperial loyalty marker in each of the other 3 Imperial systems
drawn. Return the 5 Imperial probe cards to the box and shuffle all
other probe cards back into the probe deck.

The Imperial player takes 3 Star Destroyers, 3 Assault Carriers,
12 TIE Fighters, 12 Stormtroopers, 5 AT- STs, 1 AT-AT, and 1 Death
Star. These units can be placed in any system that has an Imperial
loyalty marker or subjugation marker. At least 1 ground unit must
be placed in each Imperial system.

The Rebel player receives 1 Corellian Corvette, 1 Rebel Transport,
2 X-wings, 2 Y-wings, 6 Rebel Troopers, and 2 Airspeeders. These
units can be placed in the Rebel Base space of the board and/or in
any one Rebel or neutral system.

Each faction draws 2 random starting action cards (no recruit
icon) and places them facedown near their faction sheet. Players
can look at their own action cards at any time.

The Rebel player ensures that all systems that contain Imperial
units have been removed from the probe deck. Then, from the
remaining probe cards, they secretly choose 1 card and place it
facedown under the Rebel Base Location space on the board.

Then shuffle the probe deck and place it on the Probe Deck space.

Each player takes their 4 starting missions and draws 2 cards from
their mission deck to create their starting hand. Keep this hand of
cards secret from your opponent.

```
Systems and regions
The game board has 8 regions, separated from each other by
orange borders. Each region contains 4 systems. Each of the 32
systems on the board consists of planet art, the system’s name, a
space area around the planet, and the system’s borders. Ground
units in the system are placed on the planet, and ships are placed
in the space area.
```
```
Populous systems have a loyalty space and at least 1 resource
icon. Systems without a loyalty space or resource icons are remote
systems. Destroyed systems are no longer populous or remote.
```
## GAME ROUND

## 1. ASSIGNMENT PHASE

```
The Rebel player assigns any of their leaders to missions,
followed by the Imperial player.
```
```
To assign a leader to a mission, take a mission card from your
hand and place it facedown near your faction sheet. Then choose
1 or 2 leaders from your leader pool and place them on top of
the card.
If leaders assigned to a mission by a player or an ability do not
have a combined number of matching skill icons equal to or
exceeding the mission’s skill requirement (top left hand corner),
the mission cannot be revealed and remains facedown in the
Command phase.
```
```
Any leaders not assigned to missions stay in the leader pool and
can be used during the Command phase to move units or oppose
enemy missions.
```
## 2. COMMAND PHASE

```
Starting with the Rebel player, players alternate taking turns
activating a system or revealing a mission.
You can pass at any time. After passing, you cannot use your
leaders to activate systems or reveal missions for the rest of the
phase (you can still oppose missions or add them to combat).
```
```
After all players have passed, proceed to the Refresh phase.
```
## A. ACTIVATE A SYSTEM

```
Move your units and initiate combat by activating a system with a
leader. Take a leader from your leader pool and place it anywhere
in a system to activate it.
```
```
A leader without tactic values cannot activate a system. A system
that already contains a leader can be activated.
```
```
You cannot move units out of a system that already contains one
of your leaders. A leader in the Rebel Base space prevents units
from being moved out of the Rebel Base space, but not from
moving units that are in the Rebel base’s system.
```
```
When a system is activated, you can move your units from
adjacent systems to the activated system.
Each incoming ship can bring a number of ground units
along with it equal to its transport capacity. TIE Fighters also
require transport as if they were ground units.
```
```
Units with the transport restriction icon can only move when
you are moving units with transport capacity out of the same
system.
```
```
A unit with the immobile icon cannot move.
```
```
Units can move over orange region borders, but not through light
red impassible areas. If an ability allows you to move units, you
must follow all movement rules and restrictions.
```
```
If an Imperial ground unit moves into in a system that does not
have Imperial loyalty, place a subjugation marker there.
```
```
If an Imperial ground unit moves into a system, the Rebel player
must declare whether the Rebel base is in that system and reveal
the base before resolving a combat.
```
```
After moving units into a system that contains opposing units,
players resolve a combat.
```
## B. REVEAL A MISSION

```
Choose a facedown mission card that one of your leaders is
assigned to, flip it faceup and read it aloud.
```
```
Choose where you are resolving the mission and place the leaders
assigned to the mission in that system.
```
```
If a mission is attempted against a leader, it is attempted in that
leader’s system. If a mission is attempted or resolved in the Rebel
Base space, place the leader in the Rebel Base space of the board,
not in the system where the Rebel base is hidden.
Resolve means that the mission card’s ability automatically occurs
and cannot be opposed.
Attempt means that the mission card’s ability is only performed
if the mission succeeds. The mission will automatically succeed
unless it is opposed by an opponent’s leader.
After using a starting mission card, return it to your hand.
All other mission cards are discarded after use.
If a leader on a mission card is eliminated, captured, or moved off
the mission, the mission card returns to its owner’s hand without
being revealed.
```
```
Opposing a mission
After you declare where you are attempting a mission, your
opponent may place 1 leader from their leader pool in the system
where the mission is being attempted to oppose that mission
(even if they already have leaders in the system).
```
```
If both players have a leader there, the mission is opposed.
Starting with the current player, each player rolls dice (of any
color) equal to the combined number of skill icons on all of their
leaders in the system that match the mission’s skill requirement.
Each player can roll a maximum of 10 dice total.
```
```
Each and rolled is 1 success.
```
```
Each rolled is 2 successes.
```
```
If the player attempting the mission rolls more successes than their
opponent, the mission succeeds and they perform the ability on
the mission card.
```
```
If they roll equal to or fewer successes than their opponent, the
mission fails and they do not perform the ability.
```
```
If the mission card has a leader portrait in the top left corner, its
owner gains 2 additional successes if one of the leaders assigned
to this mission matches this portrait.
If your opponent has a leader in the system but no matching
skill icons, you must still roll dice and need at least 1 success to
succeed at the mission.
```
## 3. REFRESH PHASE

1. Retrieve leaders
The Rebel player can play 1 Start of Refresh Phase objective card.
Each player then returns all of their leaders from the board to their
leader pool. If a leader is still on a mission card, it returns to the
leader pool and the card returns to the player’s hand.
2. Draw missions
Each player draws 2 mission cards, Discard cards if you are
holding more than 10. Starting missions cannot be discarded.
3. Launch probe droids
The Imperial player draws 2 probe cards. Each shows 1 system
where the Rebel base is not located. Keep these cards secret.
4. Draw objective
The Rebel player draws 1 objective card.
5. Advance time marker
Advance the time marker 1 space along the track. Players then
recruit and/or build if these icons are in the marker’s new space:
I. Recruit: Each player simultaneously draws 2 cards from
    their action deck. The Rebel player chooses 1 leader
    shown on either card, and places that leader in their
leader pool, then the Imperial player does the same. Keep your
chosen action card facedown (you can use it at a later time)
and place the unchosen action card on the bottom of your
action deck without revealing it.
You cannot recruit a leader that is already on the board, in a
    leader pool, or eliminated from the game. If all of the leaders
    on the drawn cards have already been recruited, you may
    continue drawing cards one at a time until you draws one that
    shows a leader you have not already recruited. You can choose
    a card even if you cannot recruit any of the leaders on it (you
    gain the card but do not recruit a new leader).

```
II. Build: Players simultaneously build 1 unit for each
resource icon in their loyal and subjugated systems. You
cannot use a system’s resource icons to build units if
your opponent has a unit in the system. For subjugated
systems, use only the left-most resource icon.
The Rebel player can also use the resource icons in the Rebel
Base, unless the base is revealed and the Imperial player has a
unit or loyalty in the system.
Take the units from your supply and place them on your build
queue in the space matching the number to the left of the
resource icon. You may destroy a unit on the board if you have
none of that type available in your supply and you are placing
the unit on your build queue.
```
6. Deploy units
Starting with the Rebel player, each player slides all units 1 space
down their build queue towards their edge of the board. Any
of your units that slide from the 1 space off the board may be
deployed in systems that have your loyalty or subjugation markers.

```
Each player can deploy a maximum of 2 units in each system.
If you cannot (or don’t want to) deploy some of your units, place
them back on the 1 space of your build queue.
```
```
If it is hidden, the Rebel player may build units from, and deploy
units in, the Rebel Base space as if it were a system.
You cannot deploy units to remote systems, or systems that
contain an opponent’s ships or ground units or a sabotage marker.
```

## SKILLS

```
Diplomacy: Missions that provide loyalty in systems or give
players more units.
```
```
Intel: Rebel intel missions help acquire objective cards.
Imperial intel missions help locate the Rebel base.
Spec Ops: Rebel spec ops missions destroy Imperial units.
Imperial spec ops missions capture and exploit Rebel leaders.
Logistics: Rebel logistics missions move units to and from the
Rebel base. Imperial logistics missions build special units or
accelerate Imperial units’ build time.
```
## OBJECTIVE CARDS

The Rebel player may play an objective card from their hand if
they fulfill the card’s requirement at the specified time.

Gain the reputation shown in the card’s top-left corner by moving
the reputation marker that number of spaces toward the time
marker, then discard the card to the box (it cannot be used again
this game).

The Rebel player can have any number of objective cards in their
hand. Only 1 objective can be played during each combat and
each Refresh phase.

The project deck contains mission cards that the Imperial player
can draw by resolving their Research and Development mission.
When a project card is discarded, it is placed in the project deck
discard pile.

## ACTION CARDS

Each action card can be used once per game. Use an action card
by flipping it faceup, resolving its ability, and discarding it to the
box.

If 2 players wish to use action cards at the same time, the current
player resolves their card first. If an action card ability lets a player
search for a specific mission card, do not reveal the mission card
to your opponent.

Action cards used during a mission or combat can only be used if
one of the leaders shown on the card is already in the system.

A card specifies when it can be used:

Assignment: The card is used during the Assignment phase.
Instead of assigning a leader to a mission, a player flips the card
faceup and resolves its ability.

Start of Combat: The card is used immediately after the Add
Leader step of the combat currently being resolved.

Immediate: The card must be used as soon as the player gains
the card, either during setup or after choosing it when recruiting a
leader. The card is immediately revealed and resolved.

Special: The card is used when specified.

Players can gain additional action cards during the Advance Time
Marker step of the Refresh phase. When you recruit a leader
during this phase, place the chosen action card facedown near
your faction sheet, and place the unchosen action card facedown
at the bottom of your action deck.

## LOYALTY AND SUBJUGATION

Loyalty
A system’s current loyalty (Rebel, Imperial, or neutral) is indicated
by the loyalty marker in the system.

If a system does not have a loyalty marker, it is neutral. Remote
systems are always neutral.

Players usually gain loyalty in systems by resolving diplomacy
( ) missions. The player who has loyalty in a system can use the
system’s resources to build new units.

```
When you gain 1 loyalty in a system that is neutral, place your
loyalty marker in that system; the system is now loyal to your
faction. When you gain 1 loyalty in a system that is loyal to the
other player, remove that loyalty marker from the system; it is now
neutral.
```
```
If an ability requires you to have loyalty in a system, you must have
a loyalty marker there. It doesn’t matter if your opponent has units
or a subjugation marker in the system.
```
```
A system that has an Imperial loyalty marker or subjugation
marker is an Imperial system. Coruscant is always loyal to the
Imperial player and cannot gain or lose loyalty.
A system that has a Rebel loyalty marker and no subjugation
marker in it is a Rebel system. The Rebel Base space is not a
system and cannot gain or lose loyalty.
```
```
Subjugation
When there is at least 1 Imperial ground unit in a system that does
not have Imperial loyalty, the system becomes subjugated.
```
```
Place a subjugation marker in its loyalty space. If the system had
Rebel loyalty, place the marker on top of the Rebel loyalty marker.
```
```
A system with a subjugation marker is an Imperial system, but the
marker does not define the system’s loyalty.
```
```
If at any time there are no Imperial ground units in a subjugated
system, the subjugation marker is removed and the system’s
loyalty returns to the Rebels (or returns to neutral if no loyalty
marker is beneath it).
```
```
If a neutral subjugated system gains Imperial loyalty, flip its
subjugation marker to the loyalty side. If a subjugated system
gains Rebel loyalty, place a Rebel loyalty marker beneath the
subjugation marker.
```
```
The Imperial player can deploy units to a subjugated system, and
build new units using its left-most resource icon. The Rebel player
cannot build or deploy units in a subjugated system, even if a
Rebel loyalty marker is under the subjugation marker.
```
## LEADERS

```
Capturing leaders
Some abilities cause a Rebel leader to become captured: attach
the captured leader ring to that leader. Captured leaders do
not oppose missions; cannot return to the leader pool; cannot
use action cards; do not contribute their tactic values during a
combat; and cannot be moved by the Rebel player. However, they
do not prevent Rebel units from moving out of their system.
```
```
Captured leaders can be moved by the Imperial player like ground
units (they do not count toward transport capacity). They cannot
be moved when retreating.
```
```
If a mission is attempted against a captured leader, that leader
opposes the mission and rolls dice even though it is captured. The
Rebel player can also send another leader from their leader pool to
oppose the mission as normal.
```
```
The Imperial player has only 1 captured leader ring. If they capture
a second leader, the first leader is rescued, and they attach the
captured leader ring to the new leader.
```
```
However, the Imperial player can capture an additional leader in
carbonite. A leader in carbonite is a captured leader and can be
rescued and targeted by any card that affects captured leaders.
```
```
Rescuing captured leaders
When a captured leader is rescued, remove the ring from the
leader and place the leader in the Rebel Base space.
```
```
If there are no Imperial units in a captured leader’s system, that
leader is immediately rescued. Some mission cards can also
rescue captured leaders.
```
```
Attachment rings
Some card abilities attach rings onto leaders. When a card ability
attaches a ring to a leader, keep the card as a reminder of the
ring’s ability. If a leader with a ring receives another, the previous
ring is removed to make room for the new one.
```
```
Eliminating leaders
When a leader is eliminated, return it to the box. It cannot be used
for the rest of the game.
```
```
Luke Skywalker
Treat Luke Skywalker (Jedi) as Luke Skywalker for all card abilities
and action card restrictions.
```
## SABOTAGE MARKERS

```
A sabotage marker in a system means that neither player can use
its resource icons to build new units, and units cannot be deployed
there. A maximum of 1 sabotage marker can be in each system.
```
```
If an ability is resolved in a system that allows a player to place
units on the build queue, it can be performed even if there is a
sabotage marker in the system.
```
## SHIPS AND UNITS

```
Ships
All units with blue resource icons are ships. Super Star Destroyers,
the Death Star, and the Death Star Under Construction (DSUC)
are also ships.
A ship with a red health value is a capital ship. A ship that has a
black health value is a fighter.
```
```
Structures
The Shield Generator and Ion Cannon are special ground units
called structures. They are immobile and instead of providing dice
in combat they have special abilities.
```
```
The Death Star
The Death Star and Death Star Under Construction are space
stations, not capital ships, fighters, or structures.
```
```
The DSUC is immobile. If an ability allows the Imperial player
to deploy a Death Star in a system, it can only be placed in the
DSUC’s system. If a DSUC is destroyed, the Death Star on the
build queue is also destroyed.
```
```
The Death Star does not have a health value and cannot be
assigned or dealt damage. It can only be destroyed by the Death
Star Plans objective card (this card can also be used to destroy a
DSUC). The Rebel player can use only one of these objective cards
each combat round.
```
```
The Superlaser Online mission card can destroy a system. Place
a destroyed system marker in the system and destroy all Rebel
ground units there. The Imperial player must destroy a number
of their units that require transport that exceed the transport
capacity of Imperial ships in the system.
Ground units can move into destroyed systems, but ground battles
cannot occur there; space battles are resolved as normal.
Destroyed systems do not have loyalty and cannot be subjugated.
If the Death Star destroys the system where the Rebel base is
located, the Imperial player immediately wins the game.
```
## THE REBEL BASE

```
While the Rebel base is hidden, the Rebel player can deploy units
in the Rebel Base space on the board without revealing the system
in which their base is located.
```
```
An effect referring to the Rebel Base space is referring to that
board space and not the system where the Rebel base is hidden.
The Rebel Base space is not a system.
```
```
Moving to and from the Rebel base
While the Rebel base is hidden, Rebel units can move from the
Rebel Base space to either the base’s system or systems adjacent
to it. A leader in the Rebel Base space prevents moving units from
the space. A few missions allow Rebel units to move between the
base and any system ignoring adjacency.
```
```
Revealing the Rebel base
If the Imperial player ever has loyalty or ground units in the Rebel
Base’s system, the base is immediately revealed. When Imperial
ground units enter the system, the base is revealed before
resolving a combat.
```
```
The Rebel player may optionally reveal their base at the start of
one of their turns in the Command phase, before using one of their
leaders.
When the base is revealed, the Rebel player flips the probe card
under the Location space faceup and places it in the Rebel Base
space. All units and leaders in the Rebel Base space are placed in
the system shown on the probe card. Keep it faceup on the Rebel
Base space to remind players that the base is revealed.
```
```
While the base is revealed, the resource icons in the Rebel Base
space can still be used (unless there is an Imperial unit or Imperial
loyalty in the Rebel base’s system). However units cannot be
deployed in, or moved to, the Rebel Base space. Any leaders or
units that would be placed (not deployed) here are instead placed
in the system shown on the faceup probe card. Any cards that
apply to the Rebel Base space apply to the base’s system instead.
The Imperial Long Range Probe mission card does not reveal the
Rebel base.
```
```
Establishing a new base
The Rapid Mobilization mission card allows the Rebel player to
establish a new base. They draw the top 4 cards from the probe
deck and may choose one of them to become the new base
location. They cannot choose a system that has Imperial loyalty,
Imperial units, or a destroyed system marker.
```
```
If they choose a new base location, they reveal the old base’s
probe card and moves all units and leaders from the Rebel Base
space to the old base’s system. The Rebel player will not have any
units at the new base until they either move units to it or deploy
units there.
```
```
They give the old base’s probe card to the Imperial player and
place the new base’s probe card facedown under the Location
space. Then they shuffle all unchosen probe cards and place them
facedown on the bottom of the probe deck.
```
```
If the Rebel player chooses not to establish a new base, all drawn
probe cards are shuffled and placed on the bottom of the probe
deck.
```
## WINNING THE GAME

```
The Imperial player immediately wins the game if if there are
Imperial units in the Rebel base’s system and there are no Rebel
units in the system. The Rebel Base must be revealed.
```
```
The Imperial player immediately wins the game if the Death Star
destroys the system where the Rebel base is located.
```
```
The Rebel player immediately wins the game if the reputation
marker and time marker are in the same space of the time track.
```

## 1. ASSIGNMENT PHASE

```
The Rebel player assigns any of their leaders to missions,
followed by the Imperial player.
```
```
Place a mission card from your hand facedown, and place 1 or
2 leaders from your leader pool on top of the card.
```
```
Assigned leaders must have a combined number of matching
skill icons equal to or exceeding the mission’s skill requirement.
```
## 2. COMMAND PHASE

```
Starting with the Rebel player, players alternate taking turns
activating a system or revealing a mission. After all players have
passed, proceed to the Refresh phase.
```
## A. ACTIVATE A SYSTEM

```
Take a leader from your leader pool and place it anywhere in a
system to activate it.
```
```
A leader without tactic values cannot activate a system.
A system that already contains a leader can be activated.
You cannot move units out of a system that already contains
one of your leaders.
```
```
When a system is activated, you can move your units from
adjacent systems to the activated system.
```
```
Each incoming ship can bring a number of ground units
along with it equal to its transport capacity.
```
```
Units with the transport restriction icon can only move
when you are moving units with transport capacity out of
the same system.
An immobile unit cannot move.
```
```
If an ability allows you to move units, you must follow all
movement rules and restrictions.
```
```
If an Imperial ground unit moves into in a system that does not
have Imperial loyalty, place a subjugation marker there.
```
```
If an Imperial ground unit moves into a system, the Rebel player
must declare whether the Rebel base is in that system and
reveal the base before resolving a combat.
After moving units into a system that contains opposing units,
players resolve a combat.
```
## B. REVEAL A MISSION

```
Reveal a facedown mission card that one of your leaders is
assigned to. Choose where you are resolving the mission and
place the leaders assigned to the mission in that system.
```
```
Resolve: the mission cannot be opposed.
Attempt: the mission will automatically succeed unless it is
opposed by an opponent’s leader.
After using a starting mission card, return it to your hand.
All other mission cards are discarded after use.
```
```
Opposing a mission
After you declare where you are attempting a mission, your
opponent may place 1 leader from their leader pool in the
system where the mission is being attempted to oppose that
mission (even if they already have leaders in the system).
```
```
If both players have a leader there, the mission is opposed.
Starting with the current player, each player rolls dice equal to
the combined number of skill icons on all of their leaders in the
system that match the mission’s skill requirement.
```
```
Each player can roll a maximum of 10 dice total.
```
```
Each and rolled is 1 success.
Each rolled is 2 successes.
```
```
If the player attempting the mission rolls more successes than
their opponent, the mission succeeds; performs the ability.
```
```
If the mission card has a leader portrait in the top left corner,
its owner gains 2 additional successes if one of the leaders
assigned to this mission matches this portrait.
If your opponent has a leader in the system but no matching
skill icons, you still need at least 1 success.
```
## 3. REFRESH PHASE

1. Retrieve leaders
The Rebel player can play 1 Start of Refresh Phase objective
card. Each player then returns all of their leaders from the board
to their leader pool. A leader still on a mission card returns to
the leader pool and the card returns to the player’s hand.
2. Draw missions
Each player draws 2 mission cards, then discards down to
10 cards. Starting missions cannot be discarded.
3. Launch probe droids
The Imperial player draws 2 probe cards.
4. Draw objective
The Rebel player draws 1 objective card.
5. Advance time marker
Advance the time marker 1 space. Players recruit and/or build
if any icons are shown in the time marker’s new space.

```
I. Recruit: Each player simultaneously draws 2 action cards.
The Rebel player chooses 1 leader shown on either card
and places that leader in their leader pool; then the Imperial
player does the same.
II. Build: Players simultaneously build 1 unit for each resource
icon in their loyal and subjugated systems. You cannot use a
system’s resource icons to build units if your opponent has
a unit in the system. For subjugated systems, use only the
left-most resource icon.
```
```
The Rebel player can also use the resource icons in the
Rebel Base, unless the base is revealed and the Imperial
player has a unit or loyalty in the system.
Take the units from your supply and place them on your
build queue in the space matching the number to the left of
the resource icon.
```
```
6. Deploy units
Starting with the Rebel player, each player slides all units 1
space down their build queue. Any of your units that slide from
the 1 space off the board may be deployed in systems that have
your loyalty or subjugation markers.
```
```
Each player can deploy a maximum of 2 units in each system.
If you cannot (or don’t want to) deploy some of your units, place
them back on the 1 space of your build queue.
You cannot deploy units to remote systems, or systems that
contain an opponent’s units or a sabotage marker.
```
## SKILLS

```
Diplomacy: Missions that provide loyalty in systems or give
players more units.
```
```
Intel: Rebel intel missions help acquire objective cards.
Imperial intel missions help locate the Rebel base.
```
```
Spec Ops: Rebel spec ops missions destroy Imperial units.
Imperial spec ops missions capture and exploit Rebel leaders.
```
```
Logistics: Rebel logistics missions move units to and from
the Rebel base. Imperial logistics missions build special
units or accelerate Imperial units’ build time.
```
## 1. ASSIGNMENT PHASE

The Rebel player assigns any of their leaders to missions,
followed by the Imperial player.

Place a mission card from your hand facedown, and place 1 or
2 leaders from your leader pool on top of the card.

Assigned leaders must have a combined number of matching
skill icons equal to or exceeding the mission’s skill requirement.

## 2. COMMAND PHASE

Starting with the Rebel player, players alternate taking turns
activating a system or revealing a mission. After all players have
passed, proceed to the Refresh phase.

## A. ACTIVATE A SYSTEM

Take a leader from your leader pool and place it anywhere in a
system to activate it.

A leader without tactic values cannot activate a system.
A system that already contains a leader can be activated.
You cannot move units out of a system that already contains
one of your leaders.

When a system is activated, you can move your units from
adjacent systems to the activated system.

```
Each incoming ship can bring a number of ground units
along with it equal to its transport capacity.
```
```
Units with the transport restriction icon can only move
when you are moving units with transport capacity out of
the same system.
An immobile unit cannot move.
```
If an ability allows you to move units, you must follow all
movement rules and restrictions.

If an Imperial ground unit moves into in a system that does not
have Imperial loyalty, place a subjugation marker there.

If an Imperial ground unit moves into a system, the Rebel player
must declare whether the Rebel base is in that system and
reveal the base before resolving a combat.

After moving units into a system that contains opposing units,
players resolve a combat.

## B. REVEAL A MISSION

Reveal a facedown mission card that one of your leaders is
assigned to. Choose where you are resolving the mission and
place the leaders assigned to the mission in that system.

Resolve: the mission cannot be opposed.

Attempt: the mission will automatically succeed unless it is
opposed by an opponent’s leader.

After using a starting mission card, return it to your hand.
All other mission cards are discarded after use.

Opposing a mission
After you declare where you are attempting a mission, your
opponent may place 1 leader from their leader pool in the
system where the mission is being attempted to oppose that
mission (even if they already have leaders in the system).

If both players have a leader there, the mission is opposed.
Starting with the current player, each player rolls dice equal to
the combined number of skill icons on all of their leaders in the
system that match the mission’s skill requirement.

Each player can roll a maximum of 10 dice total.

```
Each and rolled is 1 success.
Each rolled is 2 successes.
```
```
If the player attempting the mission rolls more successes than
their opponent, the mission succeeds; performs the ability.
```
```
If the mission card has a leader portrait in the top left corner,
its owner gains 2 additional successes if one of the leaders
assigned to this mission matches this portrait.
If your opponent has a leader in the system but no matching
skill icons, you still need at least 1 success.
```
## 3. REFRESH PHASE

1. Retrieve leaders
The Rebel player can play 1 Start of Refresh Phase objective
card. Each player then returns all of their leaders from the board
to their leader pool. A leader still on a mission card returns to
the leader pool and the card returns to the player’s hand.
2. Draw missions
Each player draws 2 mission cards, then discards down to
10 cards. Starting missions cannot be discarded.
3. Launch probe droids
The Imperial player draws 2 probe cards.
4. Draw objective
The Rebel player draws 1 objective card.
5. Advance time marker
Advance the time marker 1 space. Players recruit and/or build
if these icons are shown in the marker’s new space:

```
I. Recruit: Each player simultaneously draws 2 action cards.
The Rebel player chooses 1 leader shown on either card
and places that leader in their leader pool; then the Imperial
player does the same.
II. Build: Players simultaneously build 1 unit for each resource
icon in their loyal and subjugated systems. You cannot use a
system’s resource icons to build units if your opponent has
a unit in the system. For subjugated systems, use only the
left-most resource icon.
```
```
The Rebel player can also use the resource icons in the
Rebel Base, unless the base is revealed and the Imperial
player has a unit or loyalty in the system.
Take the units from your supply and place them on your
build queue in the space matching the number to the left of
the resource icon.
```
```
6. Deploy units
Starting with the Rebel player, each player slides all units 1
space down their build queue. Any of your units that slide from
the 1 space off the board may be deployed in systems that have
your loyalty or subjugation markers.
```
```
Each player can deploy a maximum of 2 units in each system.
If you cannot (or don’t want to) deploy some of your units, place
them back on the 1 space of your build queue.
You cannot deploy units to remote systems, or systems that
contain an opponent’s units or a sabotage marker.
```
## SKILLS

```
Diplomacy: Missions that provide loyalty in systems or give
players more units.
```
```
Intel: Rebel intel missions help acquire objective cards.
Imperial intel missions help locate the Rebel base.
```
```
Spec Ops: Rebel spec ops missions destroy Imperial units.
Imperial spec ops missions capture and exploit Rebel leaders.
```

Logistics: Rebel logistics missions move units to and from
the Rebel base. Imperial logistics missions build special
units or accelerate Imperial units’ build time.
```

## COMBAT

```
Resolve combat when a player moves units to a system that
contains their opponent’s units. Combat is only resolved if both
players have units in the same theater.
```
1. Add leader
Starting with the current player, a player who does not have a
leader with tactic values in the system may choose to place 1
leader there from their leader pool.
Starting with the current player, each player may use Start of
Combat action cards.
2. Draw tactic cards
Starting with the current player, each player draws tactic cards
based on their leader in the system (if any). Draw space tactic
cards equal to your leader’s space tactic value (blue) if both
factions have ships in the system. Draw ground tactic cards
equal to your leader’s ground tactic value (orange) if both
factions have ground units in the system.

```
If you have multiple leaders in the system, use only the highest
value from each theater (space and ground).
```
3. Combat round
Resolve a combat round in which each unit performs 1 attack:

```
I. Space battle: The current player resolves 1 attack with all of
their ships. Then their opponent resolves 1 attack with all of
their own ships. Only resolve this step if both players have
ships in the system.
```
```
II. Ground battle: The current player resolves 1 attack with all
of their ground units. Then their opponent resolves 1 attack
with all of their own ground units. Only resolve this step if
both players have ground units in the system.
```
```
III. Retreat: Starting with the current player, each player has
the option to retreat their units from the system.
```
```
IV. Next round: If both factions still have units in the same
theater (space or ground), they resolve another combat
round. Otherwise, the combat ends.
```
```
If the only remaining Rebel ground units are structures
and there are still Imperial ground units in the system, the
structures are destroyed.
If the Imperial player’s only remaining ship is the DSUC and
the Rebel player still has ships in the system, the DSUC is
destroyed.
```
## RESOLVING AN ATTACK

1. Roll dice
Roll dice matching the color and quantity of the attack values of
all your participating ships or ground units.
Each attack is limited to a maximum of 5 red and 5 black dice.
An ability that reduces the number of dice rolled applies before
the limit of 5 dice is applied.
2. Combat actions
After rolling the dice, perform any number of combat actions in
any order, one at a time:
Draw a Tactic Card: You can discard one of your dice to draw
1 tactic card from this theater’s tactic deck. Tactic cards can be
used during this combat round or saved for later in this combat.

```
Play a Tactic Card: Play a tactic card from your hand and resolve
its ability. Tactic cards can only target units in the theater being
resolved and are discarded after use. If the card has the icon,
you must discard one of your dice to use the ability.
```
3. Assign damage
Choose which units to assign your damage to by placing all the
dice (or cards) next to the units. Damage can only be assigned
to units in this theater, and a unit can be assigned more damage
than it has health remaining.

```
Hit: Deal 1 damage to a unit that has a health
value matching this die’s color.
```
```
Direct Hit: Deal 1 damage to a unit that has a
black or red health value.
```
4. Block damage
Your opponent can play tactic cards that match this theatre
to block damage assigned to their units. For each damage
blocked, remove 1 damage. If an ability blocks 2 damage, it can
be used to block 2 damage assigned to one unit or one damage
assigned to 2 different units. Damage markers assigned to a
unit cannot be blocked.
5. Destroy units
If your unit has damage assigned to it that equals or exceeds
its health, it is is placed on your faction sheet and is destroyed
(returned to the supply) at the end of this combat step (either
space battle or ground battle). The unit still attacks as normal
this combat round.

```
If a unit is assigned damage less than its health value, place
damage markers under it to track the damage. The damage
remains during future combat rounds and cannot be removed.
All damage markers are discarded at the end of the combat.
```
## RETREAT

```
When you retreat from combat, take any one of your leaders
from the system and place it in an adjacent system. Then take
your units from the system and move them to that leader’s
system following normal movement and transport rules.
```
```
You must retreat to a system that contains your own units or one
of your loyalty markers, if able. You cannot retreat to a system
that contains your opponent’s units nor to a system that your
opponent moved units from to initiate the combat.
```
```
You must move all of your ships out of the system, but you can
choose to leave ground units and TIE Fighters behind. Immobile
units cannot retreat. If you leave units in the system and your
opponent has units in the same theater, resolve another combat
round.
```
```
If you do not have a leader in the system, you cannot retreat. A
leader can retreat only if the player is also retreating units. Each
player can only retreat from each combat once, even if they
have multiple leaders in the system.
```
```
The Imperial player cannot retreat any units if they have a Death
Star or DSUC in the combat.
```
```
If the only Rebel ships in the combat are Rebel Transports,
they must retreat or they are immediately destroyed. The Rebel
player can retreat only to systems, not to the Rebel Base space.
```
## ENDING & WINNING COMBAT

```
Combat ends if both factions do not have units in the same
theater after resolving the last step of a combat round.
```
```
You win a battle if your opponent does not have any units from
the same theater in the system. If you retreat all of your units in
one theater, your opponent has won the battle in that theater.
If all of both faction’s units are destroyed in a battle, that battle
has no winner. If you destroy your opponent’s last ship, but
retreat after the ground battle, you have still won the space
battle.
```
```
At the end of combat, players discard all tactic cards from
their hands, then shuffle all tactic cards back into their decks.
Remove all damage markers assigned to units and place them
back in the supply.
```
## COMBAT

Resolve combat when a player moves units to a system that
contains their opponent’s units. Combat is only resolved if both
players have units in the same theater.

1. Add leader
Starting with the current player, a player who does not have a
leader with tactic values in the system may choose to place 1
leader there from their leader pool.

Starting with the current player, each player may use Start of
Combat action cards.

2. Draw tactic cards
Starting with the current player, each player draws tactic cards
based on their leader in the system (if any). Draw space tactic
cards equal to your leader’s space tactic value (blue) if both
factions have ships in the system. Draw ground tactic cards
equal to your leader’s ground tactic value (orange) if both
factions have ground units in the system.

If you have multiple leaders in the system, use only the highest
value from each theater (space and ground).

3. Combat round
Resolve a combat round in which each unit performs 1 attack:

I. Space battle: The current player resolves 1 attack with all of
their ships. Then their opponent resolves 1 attack with all of
their own ships. Only resolve this step if both players have
ships in the system.

II. Ground battle: The current player resolves 1 attack with all
of their ground units. Then their opponent resolves 1 attack
with all of their own ground units. Only resolve this step if
both players have ground units in the system.

III. Retreat: Starting with the current player, each player has
the option to retreat their units from the system.

IV. Next round: If both factions still have units in the same
theater (space or ground), they resolve another combat
round. Otherwise, the combat ends.

If the only remaining Rebel ground units are structures
and there are still Imperial ground units in the system, the
structures are destroyed.

If the Imperial player’s only remaining ship is the DSUC and
the Rebel player still has ships in the system, the DSUC is
destroyed.

## RESOLVING AN ATTACK

1. Roll dice
Roll dice matching the color and quantity of the attack values of
all your participating ships or ground units.

Each attack is limited to a maximum of 5 red and 5 black dice.
An ability that reduces the number of dice rolled applies before
the limit of 5 dice is applied.

2. Combat actions
After rolling the dice, perform any number of combat actions in
any order, one at a time:

Draw a Tactic Card: You can discard one of your dice to draw
1 tactic card from this theater’s tactic deck. Tactic cards can be
used during this combat round or saved for later in this combat.

Play a Tactic Card: Play a tactic card from your hand and resolve
its ability. Tactic cards can only target units in the theater being
resolved and are discarded after use. If the card has the icon,
you must discard one of your dice to use the ability.

3. Assign damage
Choose which units to assign your damage to by placing all the
dice (or cards) next to the units. Damage can only be assigned
to units in this theater, and a unit can be assigned more damage
than it has health remaining.

```
Hit: Deal 1 damage to a unit that has a health
value matching this die’s color.
```
```
Direct Hit: Deal 1 damage to a unit that has a
black or red health value.
```
4. Block damage
Your opponent can play tactic cards that match this theatre
to block damage assigned to their units. For each damage
blocked, remove 1 damage. If an ability blocks 2 damage, it can
be used to block 2 damage assigned to one unit or one damage
assigned to 2 different units. Damage markers assigned to a
unit cannot be blocked.
5. Destroy units
If your unit has damage assigned to it that equals or exceeds
its health, it is is placed on your faction sheet and is destroyed
(returned to the supply) at the end of this combat step (either
space battle or ground battle). The unit still attacks as normal
this combat round.

```
If a unit is assigned damage less than its health value, place
damage markers under it to track the damage. The damage
remains during future combat rounds and cannot be removed.
All damage markers are discarded at the end of the combat.
```
## RETREAT

```
When you retreat from combat, take any one of your leaders
from the system and place it in an adjacent system. Then take
your units from the system and move them to that leader’s
system following normal movement and transport rules.
```
```
You must retreat to a system that contains your own units or one
of your loyalty markers, if able. You cannot retreat to a system
that contains your opponent’s units nor to a system that your
opponent moved units from to initiate the combat.
```
```
You must move all of your ships out of the system, but you can
choose to leave ground units and TIE Fighters behind. Immobile
units cannot retreat. If you leave units in the system and your
opponent has units in the same theater, resolve another combat
round.
```
```
If you do not have a leader in the system, you cannot retreat. A
leader can retreat only if the player is also retreating units. Each
player can only retreat from each combat once, even if they
have multiple leaders in the system.
```
```
The Imperial player cannot retreat any units if they have a Death
Star or DSUC in the combat.
```
```
If the only Rebel ships in the combat are Rebel Transports,
they must retreat or they are immediately destroyed. The Rebel
player can retreat only to systems, not to the Rebel Base space.
```
## ENDING & WINNING COMBAT

```
Combat ends if both factions do not have units in the same
theater after resolving the last step of a combat round.
```
```
You win a battle if your opponent does not have any units from
the same theater in the system. If you retreat all of your units in
one theater, your opponent has won the battle in that theater.
If all of both faction’s units are destroyed in a battle, that battle
has no winner. If you destroy your opponent’s last ship, but
retreat after the ground battle, you have still won the space
battle.
```
```
At the end of combat, players discard all tactic cards from
their hands, then shuffle all tactic cards back into their decks.
Remove all damage markers assigned to units and place them
back in the supply.
```

When choosing factions during setup, each player chooses to
play as either the Admiral (blue) or General (orange) for their
team.

A player makes all decisions for their leaders and rolls dice
for them when resolving a mission. Both players can activate
systems and move their team’s ships and/or ground units.

Use the Team Game side of each faction sheet. Each team has
2 leader pools, and all leaders are placed in the leader pool that
matches their leader color.

Setup
Each team receives 2 random action cards and gives them to
the player who controls the leader shown on the card. If a card
does not show a leader, either player may use the card.

Command phase
Players take turns in order of the initiative number shown next
to their role’s name on their faction sheet. During your turn,
you can activate a system using one of your leaders, reveal a
mission that one of your leaders is assigned to, or pass.

Players on the same team can share as much information
as they like. They can show each other cards secretly, but
all discussion must take place openly. They can talk in code
or whisper, but they cannot leave the room to have private
discussions.

When a player attempts a mission, only 1 player from the
opposing team can send a leader to the system.

Admiral’s responsibilities
Recruiting: When recruiting new leaders during the Refresh
phase, the Admiral draws 2 action cards and decides which
leader to recruit. When they recruit a leader that belongs to the
General, they give that player the card and leader to place in
their leader pool.

Space Battles: The Admiral rolls dice, draws and plays space
tactic cards, and makes all decisions during space battles.

Building and Deploying Units: The Admiral makes all decisions
when building and deploying units.

```
General’s responsibilities
Mission Cards: Both the Admiral and General can assign
their leaders to mission cards (a maximum of 2 leaders can
be assigned to each mission, regardless of which players the
leaders belong to). The General controls the hand of mission
cards, and if players disagree on assignments, the General can
disallow the Admiral from assigning a leader to a mission.
```
```
Ground Battles: The General rolls dice, draws and plays ground
tactic cards, and makes all decisions during ground battles.
```
```
Probes: The Imperial General is in charge of drawing and
managing the hand of drawn probe cards.
```
```
Objectives: The Rebel General is in charge of drawing and
managing the hand of objective cards. They make all decisions
regarding which cards to keep and when to play objective cards.
```
```
Combat
You cannot add a leader to a system if your teammate has a
leader with tactic values in the system. Each team can add a
maximum of 1 leader.
```
```
Any player can choose to retreat, as long as they use their own
leader. Each team can only retreat once per combat.
```
```
Other notes
The Imperial card Lure of the Dark Side gives the Imperial team
control of a Rebel leader until the end of the game. During the
Refresh phase, this leader is placed in the Imperial leader pool
matching the leader’s color.
```
```
The Rebel Admiral or Rebel General can reveal the Rebel base
during their turn.
```
```
Three-player game
One player controls the Rebels while the other 2 split control
of the Imperials (one Admiral, one General). The Rebel player
also uses the Team Game side of their faction sheet. They have
2 turns each round, and they must use their orange and blue
leaders separately (as if playing a 4 player game).

## TEAM GAME TEAM GAME


## RISE OF THE EMPIRE EXPANSION

## SETUP

Replace these cards from the base game with the new expansion
cards: Sabotage (Rebel mission), Son of Skywalker (Rebel action),
Good Intel (Imperial action), and both copies of Construct Super
Star Destroyer (Imperial mission). Place the new unit reference
sheet under your faction sheet. The new units can be built
following normal rules.

Sort the objective cards into 3 piles (I, II, and III). Shuffle together
a stage III deck with 1 Death Star Plans card and 4 random stage
III cards. Shuffle together a stage II deck with 1 Death Star Plans
card and 4 random stage II cards. Place this deck on top of the
stage III deck. Shuffle the stage I pile and deal 5 random cards
onto the top of the stage II deck. Then return all unused objective
cards to the box unseen.

The Rebel player draws 1 card from the objective deck, keeping it
secret from the Imperial player.

Remove all of the original tactic cards from the game and use the
new advanced tactic cards and rules.

Players choose to use the set of base game mission cards or the
Rise of the Empire set of mission cards.

```
The Rebel player and Imperial player each choose any 1
card from their mission decks, place them facedown, then
simultaneously reveal them.Each player that revealed a card
with a Darth Vader icon uses the Rise of the Empire set of
mission cards this game. They remove all cards from the deck
that do not have a leader icon or Darth Vader icon.
Each player that revealed a card with a leader icon or no icon
uses the base set of mission cards this game. They remove all
cards from the mission deck that have a Darth Vader icon.
```
All removed cards are are not used during this game. All starting
mission cards and project cards are used in every game. In a team
game, the General chooses their faction’s mission set.

After placing starting loyalty, players agree on whether to use the
starting unit list from the base game or Rise of the Empire:

```
The Imperial player places 1 Death Star on space 3 of their build
queue. They then choose any remote system and place 4 TIE
Fighters, 1 Stormtrooper, and 1 Death Star Under Construction
in that system. Then remove the remote system’s card from the
probe deck and place the card in the box.
The Imperial player receives 8 TIE Fighters, 3 Assault Carriers,
3 Star Destroyers, 2 TIE Strikers, 12 Stormtroopers, 4 AT- STs,
2 Assault Tanks, and 1 AT-AT. These units can be placed in any
system that has an Imperial loyalty marker, subjugation marker,
or a Death Star Under Construction. At least 1 ground unit must
be placed in each Imperial system.
The Rebel player receives 1 X-wing, 1 Y-wing, 1 U-wing, 1 Rebel
Transport, 1 Corellian Corvette, 5 Rebel Troopers, 2 Airspeeders,
and 1 Rebel Vanguard. These units can be placed in the Rebel
Base space and/or in any one Rebel or neutral system (except
remote systems with a DSUC).
```
## GREEN DICE

A player cannot roll more than 3 green dice when attempting
a mission or rolling dice in combat. These dice can be used in
addition to the maximum of 5 red dice and 5 black dice.

```
When an ability asks a player to roll dice, always use red or black
dice unless specified otherwise.
```
```
Some leaders have minor skill icons, represented by small skill
icons. Each minor skill icon allows the leader to roll 1 green die
when involved in a mission. Minor skill icons count toward fulfilling
skill requirements on mission cards.
```
## LEADER POOL LIMIT

```
If a player ever has more than 8 leaders in their leader pool, they
must choose 8 to keep and eliminate the excess from the game.
```
```
In a team game, each team is limited to 8 leaders. If a team has
more than 8 leaders in their pools, they must choose 8 to keep
and eliminate the excess. If one player has more leaders than their
teammate, the excess leaders must be chosen from their pool.
```
## TARGET MARKERS

```
Target markers are used by the objective cards and mission cards
with matching artwork.
```
```
When you have a ground unit in a system with a target marker
and your opponent does not have any ground units there, you can
remove the marker: its card specifies if any special effect should
be resolved.
```
```
When a system is destroyed, all target markers in the system are
also removed and the effect for removing them is resolved.
```
```
When an objective card with the word Immediate at the top is
drawn into the Rebel player’s hand, they immediately reveal and
resolve the ability. An immediate objective stays in play while
at least one of its corresponding target markers is on the board.
When all of its markers are removed, discard the objective card.
```
## UNIT ABILITIES

```
Shield bunker
Death Star protection: Death Stars and DSUC cannot be
destroyed, dealt damage, or assigned damage while in the same
system as a Shield Bunker. This makes them immune to the
Death Star Plans objective card. As soon as all Shield Bunkers in a
system are destroyed, this ability no longer applies.
```
```
Easy deployment: In addition to normal deployment rules, a Shield
Bunker may be deployed to any system that contains at least 1
Imperial ground unit and does not contain any Rebel units. The
planet’s loyalty does not matter.
Local reinforcement: When a Shield Bunker is in a remote system
that does not contain any Rebel units, the Imperial player may
deploy units to that system as if it were a loyal system. This
cannot be used during the build step in which the Shield Bunker is
deployed. Deploying a Death Star to this system counts toward the
limit of deploying 2 units during the Refresh phase.
Interdictor
Rebel units cannot retreat from a system containing an Interdictor.
Rebel abilities that provide additional ways to retreat cannot be
used in an Interdictor’s system. As soon as all Interdictors in the
system are destroyed, this ability no longer applies.
```
```
Building units
If players encounter a timing conflict when choosing which units to
build, the Rebel player chooses which units to place on the build
queue first, followed by the Imperial player.
```
```
Destroying and moving structures
All immobile ground units are structures. Normally, if a player’s
only remaining ground units in a system are structures, and their
opponent still has ground units in the system, these structures
are destroyed. However, if a player rolled at least 1 die in this
theater’s battle this round, their structures are not destroyed and
another round of combat is resolved.
```
```
Abilities that allow a player to move their opponent’s units or force
their opponent to move units cannot be used to move structures.
```
## CINEMATIC COMBAT

```
Advanced Tactic cards
During the Draw Tactic Cards step of combat, each player picks
up their tactic decks and may look through them. These decks are
never shuffled; a player has access to all of their cards, except for
those in their discard pile.
```
```
Before the first step of each round of space battle and each round
of ground battle, resolve the following steps:
```
1. Each player simultaneously chooses 1 tactic card from their
    deck that matches the current theater and places it facedown.
2. After both players have chosen their cards, they simultaneously
    turn their cards faceup.
3. Starting with the current player, each player chooses and
    resolves the top or bottom ability of their tactic card. Abilities
    preceded by a unit icon can only be resolved if there is at least
    1 unit of that type in the system.

```
Then continue resolving the battle as normal, starting with the
current player rolling dice to resolve their attack.
```
```
Players cannot play advanced tactic cards during an attack.
Advanced tactic cards are only played at the start of each round
of battle.
```
```
After you resolve an advanced tactic card, discard it faceup next
to its deck. Tactic cards in a discard pile are not shuffled back into
the deck at the end of the combat.
```
```
Instead, after you use the last tactic card from your deck, return
all cards from its discard pile to your deck (except for the card you
just resolved). Any player can examine tactic cards in a discard
pile at any time.
```
```
Leader reroll action
Leader tactic values no longer dictate the number of cards players
draw at the start of combat. Instead, as a combat action, you can
choose to reroll a number of your dice up to your leader’s tactic
value in that theater.
```
```
All dice are chosen and rerolled at once. Each die can only be
rerolled once per attack using tactic values. If you have multiple
leaders in the system, you use only the highest ground and space
values of your leaders in the system. You can use this action once
during each of your attacks.
```
```
Preventing hits
Some tactic cards prevent hits or direct hits. These abilities
take effect at the start of the Assign Damage step. Before
assigning damage, the opponent must remove dice matching the
icons shown.
```
```
Destroying and damaging units
When a unit is destroyed by a tactic card, it will not roll dice during
this round. This unit is removed after both players have resolved
their tactic cards. This means that the unit can be used to match
the unit requirement on the player’s tactic card.
```
```
Skip the Destroy Units step of attacks. Instead, units are
destroyed if they have damage equal to or exceeding their health
at the end of that round of battle (after all units in that theater
have attacked). Use damage tokens to track how much damage
has been assigned to each unit.
```
```
If your card deals damage, place a damage token on a unit of
your choice. If a color is specified, the damage must be dealt to
a unit whose health matches that color. If a card deals more than
1 damage, it can be split among multiple units unless the card
specifies 1 unit.
```
```
Removing damage
You may spend a die with a special icon as a combat action to
remove 1 damage token from one of your units.
```
```
The damage must be removed from a unit whose health matches
the color of the die. Special icons cannot be spent to draw or play
tactic cards.
```
```
Units are not destroyed until the end of the round of battle, so
you may be able to save a unit from being destroyed by removing
damage.
```
```
Canceling cards
When your tactic card is canceled, you cannot resolve any of the
abilities on it. Although the current player usually resolves their
tactic card first, if the defender’s card uses the word cancel, the
defender resolves their card first.
```
```
If you have the ability to play an additional card, the additional
card cannot be canceled and cannot be used to cancel another
card.
```
```
Additional cinematic combat rules
Obey all combat rules from the base game except the following:
If an ability lets you draw tactic cards, retrieve that many cards
of your choice from your discard pile and return them to your
deck.
```
```
The Shield Generator’s unit ability to draw 1 card is resolved
immediately before players choose their ground tactic cards.
Advanced tactic cards only affect units in the card’s theater that
are in the system in which the combat is being resolved unless
specified.
Advanced tactic card abilities last until the end of that round
of battle.
Each player must play 1 advanced tactic card each round of
battle. You may choose not to resolve any abilities and discard
the card.
If a card changes the order in which players attack, this effect
lasts until the end of the combat or until an effect changes the
order again.
```
## CARD CLARIFICATIONS

```
Subversion mission
Unlike other missions, the Subversion mission is never attempted.
Instead, reveal and resolve this card when your opponent
attempts a mission (during the Send Leaders to Oppose step).
The leaders assigned to this mission (up to 2) will oppose the
opponent’s mission.
Unlike other missions, players can reveal their Subversion
missions after passing in the command phase.
A player can oppose a mission using both a leader from their
leader pool and leaders from a Subversion mission. A player can
only resolve 1 Subversion mission per opponent’s mission.
```
```
When you use a Subversion mission, it does not count as you
resolving your turn (it is used during your opponent’s turn).
```
```
Subversion missions can only be used against missions that are
‘attempted,’ not missions that use the word ‘resolve.’
```
```
Leaders assigned to a Subversion mission are unaffected by the
Rebel Misdirection mission.
```
```
Sweep the area and Secret Facility
These action cards use the probe cards the Imperial player has
acquired during the game. They remain in play until the probe
card is revealed and their abilities are resolved.
```
```
They do not require the matching leader to be in the system to
resolve them.
```

## CINEMATIC COMBAT

```
Resolve combat when a player moves units to a system that
contains their opponent’s units.
Combat is only resolved if both players have units in the same
theater.
```
1. Add leader
Starting with the current player, a player who does not have a
leader with tactic values in the system may choose to place 1
leader there from their leader pool.
Starting with the current player, each player may use Start of
Combat action cards.
2. Draw tactic cards
Each player picks up their tactic decks and may look through
them. You have access to all of your cards, except for those in
your discard pile.
3. Combat round
I. Space battle: Only resolve this step if both players have
    ships in the system. Both players select a space tactic card
    and reveal their selection simultaneously. Starting with the
    current player, each player chooses and resolves the top or
    bottom ability of their tactic card (you may choose not to
    resolve any abilities and discard the card).
Abilities preceded by a unit icon can only be resolved if
    there is at least 1 unit of that type in the system.
The current player resolves 1 attack with all of their ships.
    Then their opponent resolves 1 attack with all of their own
    ships.
Damage: If your unit has damage assigned to it that equals
    or exceeds its health, it is is placed on your faction sheet
    and is destroyed (returned to the supply).
If a unit is assigned damage less than its health value, place
    damage markers under it to track the damage. Damage
    remains during future combat rounds.

```
II. Ground battle: Only resolve this step if both players have
ground units in the system. Both players select a ground
tactic card and reveal their selection simultaneously.
Starting with the current player, each player chooses and
resolves the top or bottom ability of their tactic card (you
may choose not to resolve any abilities and discard the
card).
Abilities preceded by a unit icon can only be resolved if
there is at least 1 unit of that type in the system.
Damage: See above.
```
```
III. Retreat: Starting with the current player, each player has
the option to retreat their units from the system.
```
```
IV. Next round: If both factions still have units in the same
theater (space or ground), they resolve another combat
round. Otherwise, the combat ends and all damage markers
are discarded.
```
```
If your only remaining ground units are structures and there
are still ground units belonging to your opponent in the
system, the structures are destroyed. However, if you rolled at
least 1 die in this theater’s battle this round, your structures
are not destroyed: resolve another round of combat.
If the Imperial player’s only remaining ship is the DSUC and
the Rebel player still has ships in the system, the DSUC is
destroyed.
```
## RESOLVING AN ATTACK

1. Roll dice
Roll dice matching the color and quantity of the attack values of
all your participating ships or ground units.

```
Each attack is limited to a maximum of 5 red, 5 black, and 3
green dice. An ability that reduces the number of dice rolled
applies before the limit of 5 dice is applied.
```
2. Combat actions
After rolling the dice, you may perform these combat actions:

```
Reroll Dice: Once per attack, you can reroll a number of your
dice up to your leader’s tactic value in that theater. If you have
multiple leaders, use only the highest relevant values.
```
```
Remove Damage: You can discard one of your dice to remove
1 damage token from one of your units whose health matches the
color of the die.
```
3. Assign damage
Choose which units to assign your damage to by placing all the
dice (or cards) next to the units. Damage can only be assigned
to units in this theater, and a unit can be assigned more damage
than it has health remaining.

```
Hit: Deal 1 damage to a unit that has a health
value matching this die’s color.
```
```
Direct Hit: Deal 1 damage to a unit that has a
black or red health value.
```
## RETREAT

```
When you retreat from combat, take any one of your leaders
from the system and place it in an adjacent system. Then take
your units from the system and move them to that leader’s
system following normal movement and transport rules.
```
```
You must retreat to a system that contains your own units or one
of your loyalty markers, if able. You cannot retreat to a system
that contains your opponent’s units nor to a system that your
opponent moved units from to initiate the combat.
```
```
You must move all of your ships out of the system, but you can
choose to leave ground units and TIE Fighters behind. Immobile
units cannot retreat. If you leave units in the system and your
opponent has units in the same theater, resolve another combat
round.
```
```
If you do not have a leader in the system, you cannot retreat. A
leader can retreat only if the player is also retreating units. Each
player can only retreat from each combat once, even if they
have multiple leaders in the system.
```
```
The Imperial player cannot retreat any units if they have a
Death Star or DSUC in the combat.
```
```
If the only Rebel ships in the combat are Rebel Transports,
they must retreat or they are immediately destroyed. The Rebel
player can retreat only to systems, not to the Rebel Base space.
```
## ENDING & WINNING COMBAT

```
Combat ends if both factions do not have units in the same
theater after resolving the last step of a combat round.
You win a battle if your opponent does not have any units from
the same theater in the system. If you retreat all of your units in
one theater, your opponent has won the battle in that theater.
If all of both faction’s units are destroyed in a battle, that battle
has no winner. If you destroy your opponent’s last ship, but
retreat after the ground battle, you have still won the space
battle.
```
```
At the end of combat, players remove all damage markers
assigned to units and place them back in the supply. Tactic
cards in a discard pile are not shuffled back into the deck at the
end of the combat.
```
## CINEMATIC COMBAT

Resolve combat when a player moves units to a system that
contains their opponent’s units.

Combat is only resolved if both players have units in the same
theater.

1. Add leader
Starting with the current player, a player who does not have a
leader with tactic values in the system may choose to place 1
leader there from their leader pool.

Starting with the current player, each player may use Start of
Combat action cards.

2. Draw tactic cards
Each player picks up their tactic decks and may look through
them. You have access to all of your cards, except for those in
your discard pile.
3. Combat round
I. Space battle: Only resolve this step if both players have
    ships in the system. Both players select a space tactic card
    and reveal their selection simultaneously. Starting with the
    current player, each player chooses and resolves the top or
    bottom ability of their tactic card (you may choose not to
    resolve any abilities and discard the card).

Abilities preceded by a unit icon can only be resolved if
there is at least 1 unit of that type in the system.

The current player resolves 1 attack with all of their ships.
Then their opponent resolves 1 attack with all of their own
ships.

Damage: If your unit has damage assigned to it that equals
or exceeds its health, it is is placed on your faction sheet
and is destroyed (returned to the supply).

If a unit is assigned damage less than its health value, place
damage markers under it to track the damage. Damage
remains during future combat rounds.

II. Ground battle: Only resolve this step if both players have
ground units in the system. Both players select a ground
tactic card and reveal their selection simultaneously.
Starting with the current player, each player chooses and
resolves the top or bottom ability of their tactic card (you
may choose not to resolve any abilities and discard the
card).

Abilities preceded by a unit icon can only be resolved if
there is at least 1 unit of that type in the system.

Damage: See above.

III. Retreat: Starting with the current player, each player has
the option to retreat their units from the system.

IV. Next round: If both factions still have units in the same
theater (space or ground), they resolve another combat
round. Otherwise, the combat ends and all damage markers
are discarded.

If your only remaining ground units are structures and there
are still ground units belonging to your opponent in the
system, the structures are destroyed. However, if you rolled at
least 1 die in this theater’s battle this round, your structures
are not destroyed: resolve another round of combat.

If the Imperial player’s only remaining ship is the DSUC and
the Rebel player still has ships in the system, the DSUC is
destroyed.

## RESOLVING AN ATTACK

1. Roll dice
Roll dice matching the color and quantity of the attack values of
all your participating ships or ground units.

```
Each attack is limited to a maximum of 5 red, 5 black, and 3
green dice. An ability that reduces the number of dice rolled
applies before the limit of 5 dice is applied.
```
2. Combat actions
After rolling the dice, you may perform these combat actions:

```
Reroll Dice: Once per attack, you can reroll a number of your
dice up to your leader’s tactic value in that theater. If you have
multiple leaders, use only the highest relevant values.
```
```
Remove Damage: You can discard one of your dice to remove
1 damage token from one of your units whose health matches the
color of the die.
```
3. Assign damage
Choose which units to assign your damage to by placing all the
dice (or cards) next to the units. Damage can only be assigned
to units in this theater, and a unit can be assigned more damage
than it has health remaining.

```
Hit: Deal 1 damage to a unit that has a health
value matching this die’s color.
```
```
Direct Hit: Deal 1 damage to a unit that has a
black or red health value.
```
## RETREAT

```
When you retreat from combat, take any one of your leaders
from the system and place it in an adjacent system. Then take
your units from the system and move them to that leader’s
system following normal movement and transport rules.
```
```
You must retreat to a system that contains your own units or one
of your loyalty markers, if able. You cannot retreat to a system
that contains your opponent’s units nor to a system that your
opponent moved units from to initiate the combat.
```
```
You must move all of your ships out of the system, but you can
choose to leave ground units and TIE Fighters behind. Immobile
units cannot retreat. If you leave units in the system and your
opponent has units in the same theater, resolve another combat
round.
```
```
If you do not have a leader in the system, you cannot retreat. A
leader can retreat only if the player is also retreating units. Each
player can only retreat from each combat once, even if they
have multiple leaders in the system.
```
```
The Imperial player cannot retreat any units if they have a
Death Star or DSUC in the combat.
```
```
If the only Rebel ships in the combat are Rebel Transports,
they must retreat or they are immediately destroyed. The Rebel
player can retreat only to systems, not to the Rebel Base space.
```
## ENDING & WINNING COMBAT

```
Combat ends if both factions do not have units in the same
theater after resolving the last step of a combat round.
You win a battle if your opponent does not have any units from
the same theater in the system. If you retreat all of your units in
one theater, your opponent has won the battle in that theater.
If all of both faction’s units are destroyed in a battle, that battle
has no winner. If you destroy your opponent’s last ship, but
retreat after the ground battle, you have still won the space
battle.
```
```
At the end of combat, players remove all damage markers
assigned to units and place them back in the supply. Tactic
cards in a discard pile are not shuffled back into the deck at the
end of the combat.
```
