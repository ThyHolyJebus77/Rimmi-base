## Comparisons to Civilization 5/6

- Different genre: While Civilization is a turn-based strategy video game, Warhammer: Age of Sigmar is a tabletop miniature wargame, offering a more tactile and physical gaming experience.

- Focus on combat: Age of Sigmar emphasizes tactical combat between armies, whereas Civilization balances warfare with diplomacy, city-building, and technological advancement.

- Time scale: Civilization spans thousands of years of human history, while Age of Sigmar takes place in a fantasy setting with battles typically representing a single engagement.

- Resource management: Civilization involves complex resource management and city development, while Age of Sigmar focuses on army composition and tactical deployment.

- Unit variety: Both games feature a wide variety of units, but Age of Sigmar's units are represented by physical miniatures that players collect and paint.

- Technology progression: Civilization has a complex tech tree that players progress through over time, while Age of Sigmar does not have a technological progression system.

- Map interaction: Civilization uses a grid-based map with terrain affecting gameplay, while Age of Sigmar uses 3D terrain pieces on an open tabletop.

- Victory conditions: Civilization offers multiple paths to victory (e.g., science, culture, domination), whereas Age of Sigmar typically focuses on battlefield objectives and eliminating enemy forces.

- Player count: Civilization is primarily designed for single-player or small multiplayer groups, while Age of Sigmar is designed for two or more players in direct competition.

# Warhammer: Age of Sigmar - Rules
## SETUP

Choose open, narrative, or matched play. Choose a battleplack
and follow its instructions. Prepare the battlefield, place terrain,
and deploy your armies.

When you set up a reserve unit, tell your opponent it is in reserve
and set it up to one side. At the start of the 4th battle round,,
units still in reserve are destroyed. Units cannot cast spells or use
abilities while in reserve unless specifically stated otherwise.

## BASICS

Each player is the commander of an army, made up of 1 or more
factions. Models from your army are friendly models, and models
from your opponent’s army are enemy models. If an effect doesn’t
specify friendly or enemy targets, it affects both.

Models fight in units a group of models that use the same
warscroll. Some models can be in formations called warscroll
battalions. Your army can include 1 endless spell for each
**wizard** and 1 invocation for each **priest** , as well as 1 faction
terrain feature. Choose 2 model to be your general.

Units must be set up and finish every move as a single coherent
group. A unit with 2-5 models must have all models within 1"
horizontally and 6" vertically of at least 1 other model in the unit.
A unit with 6+ models must have all models within 1" horizontally
and 6" vertically of at least 2 other models in the unit.

To make a roll-off, each player rolls a dice, and whoever rolls
highest wins. Neither player may re-roll or modify any of the dice.
On a tie, roll-off again.

To make a re-roll, roll the dice used for the roll again. You must re-
roll all of the dice used for the roll. You cannot re-roll a dice more
than once, and modifiers are applied after re-rolls.

You can measure distances whenever you wish. Distances are
measured in inches, between the closest points of the bases of
the models. If a model does not have a base, measure to and from
the closest point of that model instead. When measuring between
units, always use the closest model from each unit. A model is
wholly within a distance if all of its base (or all the bases of a unit)
is within that distance.

## GAME STRUCTURE

A battle is fought in battle rounds, each split into 2 turns, one for
each player. On your turn, perform the 6 phases in sequence.

At the start of each battle round, players make a priority roll. Roll
off, and the winner has priority and decides who takes the first
turn. On a tie, on the first round the player that finished deploying
their army first has priority; otherwise, the player who went first in
the last round has priority.

The player taking the first turn receives 1 command point (CP),
and the other player receives 2 CPs.

#### COMMAND ABILITIES

To use a command ability, spend 1 CP, pick 1 friendly model to
issue the command, and pick 1 friendly unit to receive it. Unit
champions can issue commands to their own unit. **heroes** can
issue commands to units wholly within 12", generals to units
wholly within 18", and **totems** to units wholly within 18".

A model cannot issue more than 1 command in the same phase,
and a unit cannot receive more than 1 in the same phase. You
cannot use the same command ability more than once in the
same phase.

## HERO PHASE

```
Starting with the player whose turn it is, each player may pick 1
hero to perform a heroic action, and each player receives 1 CP if
their general is on the battlefield.
```
```
You can cast spells with friendly wizards , chant prayers and
banish invocations with friendly priests , and both wizards and
priests may attempt to dispel endless spells. In the enemy hero
phase you can use friendly wizards to unbind spells.
```
#### COMMAND ABILITY

```
Rally: You can use this command ability at the start of this phase.
The unit that receives this command must be more than 3" from
all enemy units. Roll D6 for each slain model in the unit; for each
6, you can return 1 slain model to the unit.
```
#### HEROIC ACTIONS

```
Heroic Leadership: Pick 1 friendly hero and roll D6, adding 2 if
your general has been slain. On 4+, you receive 1 CP that can only
be spent during that turn to allow that hero to issue a command.
```
```
Heroic Willpower: Pick 1 friendly hero that is not a wizard.
If it is the enemy hero phase, that hero may attempt to unbind
1 spell as if they were a wizard. If it is your hero phase, that hero
may attempt to dispel 1 endless spell in that phase as if they were
a wizard (you can still only attempt to unbind or dispel the same
spell or endless spell once in the same phase).
```
```
Their Finest Hour: Pick 1 friendly hero and add 1 to wound rolls
for their attacks and add 1 to save rolls for attacks that target that
hero, until the end of that turn. You cannot carry out this heroic
action with the same hero more than once in the same battle.
```
```
Heroic Recovery: Pick 1 friendly hero more than 3" from all
enemy units and make a 2D6 heroic recovery roll. If the roll is less
than the hero’s BRAVERY, they can heal up to D3 wounds.
```
## MOVEMENT PHASE

```
You may pick 1 friendly unit more than 3" from all enemy units
and declare it will make a normal move or run, or you can pick
1 friendly unit within 3" of an enemy unit and declare that it will
retreat. Once you have moved that unit, you can do the same for
the other units in your army. A unit may not be chosen twice.
Normal move: Move each model in the unit up to their MOVE in
inches. The unit cannot move within 3" of an enemy unit.
Retreat: Move each model in the unit up to their MOVE in inches.
The unit must end the move more than 3" from all enemy units.
You cannot shoot or charge later in the turn with this unit.
```
```
Run: Make a D6 run roll, then move each model in the unit up to
their MOVE plus the result in inches. No part of a run can be within
3" of an enemy unit. You cannot shoot or charge later in the turn
with this unit.
To move a model, trace a path showing the route it will travel,
up to the distance the model can move in any direction, but not
across other models or the edge of the battlefield. Then move
the model along the path, pivoting it freely. After you have moved
all the models in a unit, it must be coherent (if it is impossible
for it to be so, you cannot move it). You can also choose for a
unit to remain stationery, in which case none of its models are
considered to have made a move.
```
```
When you move a model, you can trace its path over terrain
features but not through them; following the path along the
surfaces but with its base staying parallel of the battlefield. When
a model jumps directly down from a feature, the distance it drops
down counts towards the distance moved
If a model can Fly, you can ignore other models or terrain features
when you trace your path, and can trace it through the air. A flying
model cannot finish a move on top of another model, or finish a
normal move, run or retreat within 3" of an enemy unit.
```
#### COMMAND ABILITIES

```
At the Double: You can use this command ability after you declare
that a friendly unit will run; that unit must receive the command.
Instead of making a run roll, add 6" to that units MOVE in that
phase. The unit is still considered to have run.
```
```
Redeploy: You can use this command ability in the enemy
movement phase after an enemy unit finishes a normal move, run
or retreat. The unit that receives the command must be within 9"
of that enemy unit and more than 3" from all enemy units. You can
make a D6" move with your unit, but must finish the move more
than 3" from all enemy units and cannot shoot later in the turn.
```
## SHOOTING PHASE

```
Pick a friendly unit and make shooting attacks with as many of
its models as you wish. Then do the same for the other units in
your army you wish to shoot with. Units that have run or retreated
cannot shoot in the same turn.
```
```
A unit that is within 3" of any enemy units can only target enemy
units that are within 3" of it. A unit can shoot at an enemy unit
that is within 3" of another friendly unit without penalty.
```
```
Look Out, Sir! Subtract 1 from hit rolls made for missile weapons
if the target is an enemy HERO within 3" of an enemy unit that has
3+ models. This rule does not apply if the hero has 10+ WOUNDS.
```
## CHARGE PHASE

```
Pick a friendly unit within 12" of an enemy unit to attempt a
charge. Then do the same with other eligible units in your army
until you have attempted a charge with as many units as you wish.
A unit cannot attempt a charge more than once in a phase. A unit
cannot attempt a charge if it ran or retreated this turn, or if it is
within 3" of an enemy unit.
```
```
Make a 2D6 charge roll for the unit (you do not have to pick a
target). Each model in the unit can charge move a number of
inches up to the charge roll. The first model you move in the
unit must finish the move within ½" of an enemy unit. If that’s
impossible, no models in the unit can make a charge move.
```
#### COMMAND ABILITIES

```
Forward to Victory: You can use this command ability after you
make a charge roll for a friendly unit. That unit must receive the
command. You can re-roll the charge roll for that unit.
```
```
Unleash Hell: You can use this command ability after an enemy
unit finishes a charge move. The unit that receives the command
must be within 6" of that enemy unit and more than 3" from all
enemy units. The unit can shoot, but you must subtract 1 from its
hit rolls and it can only target the unit that made the charge move.
```
#### MONSTROUS RAMPAGE

```
At the end of the charge phase, each player can carry out 1
monstrous rampage with each friendly monster. The player
whose turn it is completes their rampages first, followed by their
opponent. The same player cannot carry out the same monstrous
rampage more than once per phase.
```
```
Roar: Pick 1 enemy unit within 3" of this model and roll D6. On
3+, that unit cannot issue or receive commands in the following
combat phase.
```
```
Stomp: Pick 1 enemy unit within 3" of this model that is not a
monster and roll D6. On 2+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
```
```
Titanic Duel: Pick 1 enemy monster within 3" of this model. Add 1
to hit rolls for attacks made by this model that target that enemy
monster until the end of the following combat phase.
```
```
Smash to Rubble: Pick 1 faction terrain feature or defensible
terrain feature within 3" of this model and roll D6. On 3+ the
feature is demolished it it was defensible, and its scenery rules
cannot be used for the rest of the battle if it was a faction feature.
```
## COMBAT PHASE

```
Starting with the player whose turn it is, players alternate picking
a friendly unit. When it is your turn to pick, you must either pick 1
eligible unit to fight or you must pass. A unit is eligible if it is within
3" of an enemy unit and it has not fought in that phase, or if it
made a charge move that turn and has not fought in that phase.
You cannot pass if there is a friendly unit that is eligible to fight.
```
```
After picking a unit to fight, you can first make a pile in move of up
to 3" with each model in the unit, ensuring the model finishes the
move no further from the nearest enemy unit than it was at the
start of the move. Then you must make combat attacks with each
model that is within range of an enemy model.
```
```
If you pass, you do nothing, and the option to fight or pass goes
back to your opponent. If both players pass in succession, the
combat phase ends (unless some units have strike-last effects).
```
## BATTLESHOCK PHASE

```
Both players must take a battleshock test for each friendly unit
that had models slain that turn. The first player whose turn it is
takes all their tests first, followed by their opponent.
```
```
Make a D6 battleshock roll for each such unit, adding the number
of models from the unit that were slain. If the roll is greater than
the unit’s BRAVERY, the test has failed. For each point by which
the roll exceeds the unit’s BRAVERY, 1 model in that unit must
flee. You decide which models flee: remove them from play.
```
```
If a friendly unit is not coherent at the end of a turn, you must
remove models in it from play, one at a time, until it is coherent.
```
#### COMMAND ABILITY

```
Inspiring Presence: You can use this command ability at the start
of this phase. The unit that receives this command does not have
to take battleshock tests in that phase.
```
## END OF THE BATTLE ROUND

```
The end of the battle round is reached once the battleshock
phase of the player taking the second turn has finished. Check
battlepack victory conditions. Any CPs remaining at the end of a
round are lost and a new battle round begins.
```
## ATTACKING

```
When you shoot or fight with a unit, it makes attacks with all the
weapons it is armed with as listed on its warscroll. Pick the target
unit(s) for all the attacks before you make any. Only enemy units
can be chosen. Then make the attacks in the order you wish.
```
```
Shooting attacks can be made with any of the missile weapons
the models are armed with that they are allowed to use (including
those used by mounts). The target must be within a number of
inches of the attacking model equal to the weapon’s RANGE,
measured to the closest visible model in the target unit. Models
can see through other models in their unit. Missile weapons with
a minimum range cannot target units that are wholly within the
minimum range.
```
```
Combat attacks can be made with all of the melee weapons the
models are armed with that they are allowed to use (including
those used by mounts).The target must be within a number of
inches of the attacking model equal to the weapon’s RANGE, but
does not have to be visible.
```
```
The number of attacks you make with a weapon is equal to its
ATTACKS. Make the attacks one at a time, unless you are making
combined attacks. If the weapon has an ATTACKS of more than 1,
you can split the attacks between target units.
If a model has 2 of the same weapon, the ATTACKS for the weapon
will already take the extra weapon into account, or the model will
have an ability that represents the dual -wielding.
```

You can make combined attacks if all of the attacks are made by
models from the same unit, with the same type of weapon, against
the same target unit, and with the same re-rolls and modifiers. If
this is the case, make all of the hit rolls at the same time, then all
of the wound rolls, and finally all of the save rolls.

#### ATTACK SEQUENCE

In some cases, you can resolve all of the attacks made by the
same type of weapon at the same time.

1. Hit Roll: Roll D6. If the roll equals or beats the attacking
    weapon’s TO HIT, it scores a hit and you must make a wound
    roll. If not, the attack fails and the attack sequence ends.
    A natural roll of 1 always fails, and a natural roll of 6 always
    hits. A hit roll can never be modified by more than +1 or -1.
2. Wound Roll: Roll D6. If the roll equals or beats the attacking
    weapon’s TO WOUND, the attack wounds the target and your
    opponent must make a save roll. If not, the attack fails and
    the attack sequence ends. A natural roll of 1 always fails, and
    a natural roll of 6 always wounds. A wound roll can never be
    modified by more than +/-1.
3. Save Roll: Your opponent rolls D6, modifying the roll by the
    attacking weapon’s REND. If the roll equals or beats the target
    unit’s SAVE, the target is saved and the attack sequence ends.
    If not, the attacks is successful and you must determine the
    damage inflicted on the target unit. A natural roll of 1 always
    fails. A save roll can never be modified by more than +1.
4. Damage: Each successful attack inflicts damage on the target
    unit equal to the DAMAGE characteristic of the weapon used.

Once all of your unit’s attacks have been made, total the damage
inflicted on each target unit. The player commanding each
target unit allocates a number of wounds to that unit equal to the
damage that was inflicted on it. Once all the damage inflicted by a
unit’s attacks has been allocated, its attacks have been resolved.

#### COMMAND ABILITIES

Command abilities that affect an attack must be used before its
attack sequence has started.

All-out Attack: You can use this command ability when you pick a
friendly unit to shoot in your shooting phase or fight in the combat
phase. That unit must receive the command. Add 1 to hit rolls for
attacks made by that unit until the end of that phase.

All-out Defence: You can use this command ability when a friendly
unit is picked as the target of an attack in the shooting or combat
phase. That unit must receive the command. Add 1 to save rolls
for attacks that target that unit until the end of that phase.

#### WOUNDS

Wounds are allocated to the models in a unit 1 wound at a time.
You can allocate the wounds caused to your units as you see
fit. However, once you allocate a wound to a model, you cannot
allocate wounds to other models in the unit until that model is
slain. If a unit is destroyed, all wounds that remain to be allocated
to it are negated.

Once the number of wounds allocated to a model equals its
WOUNDS, it is slain and you cannot allocate any more wounds to
it. The model is removed from play after all wounds caused to its
unit have been allocated and all attacks inflicting damage on the
unit have been resolved.

If you are allowed to return models to a unit, set them up, one at a
time, within 1" of a model from their unit that was not returned to
it earlier in the phase. Slain models can only be set up within 3" of
an enemy unit if a model in their unit was not returned to the unit
in the same phase is already within 3" of that enemy unit.

Wards: These abilities allow you to roll dice to negate a wound
before it is allocated. Up to 1 ward roll can be made for each
wound or mortal wound before it is allocated. If successful, the
wound or mortal wound is negated it has no effect on the model.

```
Heal wounds: For each wound that is healed, reduce the number
of wounds allocated to the model by 1, to a minimum of 0. You
cannot heal wounds on a slain model.
```
```
Mortal wounds: Do not make hit, wound or save rolls for mortal
wounds. Instead, the damage inflicted is equal to the number of
mortal wounds that were caused. Allocate any mortal wounds
at the same time as wounds caused by the unit’s attacks, after
all of the unit’s attacks have been made. Mortal wounds caused
at other times are allocated as soon as they are caused. Mortal
wounds are allocated in the same manner as wounds and are
treated in the same way.
```
## OBJECTIVES

```
Objectives are indicated with a suitable objective marker.
Measure distances to and from them from the marker’s centre.
Always set them up as close to the battlefield surface as possible.
```
```
After setup but before the first battle round begins, each player
gains control of all objectives that are within 6" of any friendly
models and more than 6" from all enemy models. At the end of
each turn, after the battleshock phase), check to see if you have
gained control of any objectives: count the number of friendly
models contesting each objective. You gain control of an objective
if there are more friendly models contesting it than enemy models.
Once you gain control of an objective, it remains under your
control until your opponent gains control of it.
```
```
A model must be within 6" of an objective to contest it. If a
friendly unit could contest 2 or more objectives, choose which one
the models from that unit are contesting. Each monster counts
as 5 models, and each model with WOUNDS of 5 or more that is
not a monster counts as 2 models.
```
```
Defensible terrain features are controlled by the player who has
units garrisoning it, and other features are controlled in the way
way as an objective, except that friendly models must be within 3"
of a part of the feature (instead of within 6" of the centre)
```
## WIZARDS

#### SPELLS

```
Each friendly wizard can attempt to cast spells they know in
your hero phase and unbind spells in the enemy hero phase.
If a wizard unit has more than 1 model, it counts as 1 wizard
for rules purposes; pick 1 model in the unit to cast or unbind with,
determining range and visibility from that model.
```
```
You cannot cast the same spell more than once in the same hero
phase, even with a different wizard. Pick a friendly wizard,
declare which spell they are attempting to cast, and make a 2D
casting roll. If the roll is equal to or greater than the spell’s casting
value, it is successfully cast. On a natural 2, the spell is miscast; it
is not successfully cast, the caster suffers D3 mortal wounds, and
the caster cannot attempt to cast any more spells that phase.
```
```
If the spell is successfully cast, your opponent can pick 1 of their
wizards within 30" of the caster and make 2D6 unbinding roll. If
the roll is greater than the roll used to cast the spell, the spell is
unbound and its effect not applied. Only 1 unbinding attempt can
be made for each spell.
```
```
All wizards know these spells in addition to the spells on their
warscroll and the endless spells of their army:
```
```
Arcane Bolt: Casting value 5. If cast, at the start of any 1 phase
before your next hero phase, you can pick 1 enemy unit within
12" of the caster and visible to them. That unit suffers 1 mortal
wound. If that unit is within 3" of the caster, it suffers D3 mortal
wounds instead.
Mystic Shield: Casting value 5. If cast, pick 1 friendly unit wholly
within 12" of the caster and visible to them. Add 1 to save rolls for
attacks that target that unit until your next hero phase.
```
#### ENDLESS SPELLS

```
You can also attempt to summon 1 endless spell with each
friendly wizard. This counts as 1 of the spells your wizard
is allowed to cast. When the spell is successfully cast and not
unbound, set up the endless spell as described on its warscroll.
If it is impossible to set up, the casting attempt is unsuccessful.
```
```
At the start of the hero phase, each player may attempt to dispel
1 endless spell with each friendly wizard and priest. The
player whose turn it is makes all of their attempts first. If a wizard
attempts to dispel an endless spell, they can attempt to cast or
unbind 1 fewer spell in their hero phase. If a priest attempts to
dispel an endless spell, they can chant 1 fewer prayer in that
hero phase. The same player cannot attempt to dispel the same
endless spell more than once per phase.
```
```
Pick 1 endless spell within 30" of a friendly wizard or priest and
visible to them and make a 2D6 dispelling roll. If the roll is greater
than the endless spell’s casting value, it is dispelled and removed
from play. It cannot be summoned again in the same turn.
An endless spell cannot be attacked or affected by abilities. You
can move models across or through them, but you cannot finish
a move on one.
```
```
An endless spell remains in play until it is removed from play if it is
dispelled, or touches the edge of the battlefield after it is moved,
or a method on its warscroll is used to remove it from play.
```
```
Predatory endless spells are moved at the end of the hero phase.
If either player has abilities that can be used at the end of the hero
phase, they must be used after all predatory endless spells have
been moved. A predatory endless spell within 30" of the model
that summoned it is controlled by that model. A wizard can
control 1 predatory endless spell per hero phase (pick 1 if there
are more than 1). Otherwise the predatory endless spell is wild.
```
```
The player whose turn it is moves all the predatory endless spells
controlled by friendly wizards; then their opponent does the
same. Then, starting with the player whose turn it is, the players
alternate picking 1 wild predatory endless spell to move, until all
have been moved. You must pick 1 if able, and cannot pick 1 that
has already moved this phase.
```
```
When you pick a wild predatory endless spell to move, you are its
commanding player until the end of the next hero phase. All other
endless spells are controlled by the player that summoned them.
```
## PRIESTS

#### PRAYERS

```
Each friendly priest can chant 1 prayer they know in your hero
phase. You cannot chant the same prayer more than once in the
same hero phase, even with a different priest. Pick a friendly
priest, declare which prayer they chanting, and make a D
chanting roll. If the roll is equal to or greater than the spell’s
answer value, it is answered. On a natural 1, the priest suffers
divine wrath; the prayer is not answered and the priest suffers 1
mortal wound.
```
```
All priests know these spells in addition to the prayers on their
warscroll and the invocations of their army:
```
```
Bless: Answer value 5. If answered, pick 1 friendly unit wholly
within 12" of the chanter and visible to them. Until the start of
your next hero phase, that unit has a ward of 6+.
```
```
Smite: Answer value 2. If answered, pick 1 enemy priest within
48" of the chanter and visible to them to suffer 1 mortal wound. If
the chanting roll was 6+, they suffer D3 mortal wounds instead.
```
```
INVOCATIONS
You can also attempt to summon 1 invocation with each friendly
priest. When the prayer is answered, set up the invocation as
described on its warscroll. If it is impossible to set up, the prayer
is not answered.
```
```
At the start of your hero phase, you can attempt to banish 1
invocation with each friendly priest. instead of chanting a prayer
with that priest. The same player cannot attempt to banish the
same invocation more than once per phase.
```
```
Pick 1 invocation within 48" of a friendly priest and visible to
them and make a D6 banishment roll. If the roll is greater than the
invocation’s answer value, it is banished and removed from play. It
cannot be summoned again in the same turn.
An invocation cannot be attacked or affected by abilities. You
can move models across or through them, but you cannot finish
a move on one. It remains in play until removed from play if it is
banished, touches the edge of the battlefield after it is moved, or a
method on its warscroll or in an allegiance ability is used to remove
it from play. It can be summoned again in a subsequent turn.
```
## TERRAIN

```
A unit is wholly on terrain if its no part of its base (or the model, if
it has no base) extends beyond the feature’s edge. A target unit is
behind terrain if it is more than 3" from the attacking unit, all of its
models are within 1" of the feature, and the attacker cannot draw
a straight line between the closest models in both units without
that line passing across the feature.
Scatter terrain is decorative terrain that can be ignored when
moving, attacking, or checking visibility.
A target unit is in cover if all of its models are wholly on a terrain
feature or behind a terrain feature. Add 1 to save rolls for attacks
that target a unit in cover. A unit with WOUNDS of 10 or more or
that has made a charge move in the same turn does not receive
the benefit of being in cover.
Defensible terrain features can be garrisoned. A model cannot
move over them unless it can fly, and no model may be moved on
them unless it is garrisoning the feature.
Large (12-19" and across at its widest point) and very large
(more than 19" across at its widest point) terrain features can be
garrisoned by more models, and count as 2 or 4 terrain features
respectively when setting up terrain.
Wyldwoods conceal targets within them. Visibility between 2
models is blocked if a straight line 1mm wide drawn between
them passes across more than 3" of the wood. Visibility to and
from models with WOUNDS of 10 or more is not blocked.
```
#### GARRISONS

```
Up to 60 models can garrison a very large terrain feature, up to
30 a large feature, and up to 15 other defensible features. Models
with WOUNDS of 10 or more cannot garrison terrain features.
During deployment, a friendly unit can be set up in a garrison if
the feature is wholly within a legal deployment area. Also a friendly
unit can can garrison a terrain feature instead of making a normal
move if all of its models are within 6" of the feature, and no enemy
models are in the garrison (even if it is within 3" of the enemy).
```
```
Units that garrison a terrain feature are removed from the
battlefield and are assumed to be ‘inside’ the terrain feature.
Friendly units must treat terrain features garrisoned by enemy
units as if they were enemy models.
```
```
Subtract 1 from hit rolls and add 1 to save rolls for attacks that
target a unit in a garrison. Determine range and visibility to and
from the models using the terrain feature instead of the models.
```
```
A friendly unit in a garrison can leave it at the end of your
movement phase. Set it up so that all models in the unit are within
6" of the terrain feature and more than 3" from all enemy units. A
unit cannot join and leave a garrison in the same turn.
When a defensible terrain feature is demolished, all units in it
must leave and it is no longer defensible. Roll D6 for each model
in the garrison: on 1, it is slain. Set up surviving models within 6"
of the terrain feature and more than 3" from all enemy units.
```

## GAME STRUCTURE

Players make a priority roll. The winner has priority and decides
who takes the first turn. The player taking the first turn receives
1 command point (CP), and the other player receives 2 CPs.

Command ability: Spend 1 CP, pick 1 friendly model to issue
the command, and pick 1 friendly unit to receive it. Champions
can issue commands to their own unit, **heroes** to units wholly
within 12", generals 18, and **totems** 18".

## HERO PHASE

Each player may pick 1 **hero** to perform a heroic action, and
each player receives 1 CP if their general is on the battlefield.

You can cast spells with friendly **wizards** , chant prayers and
banish invocations with friendly **priests** , and both wizards and
priests may attempt to dispel endless spells. In the enemy hero
phase you can use friendly **wizards** to unbind spells.

slain. On 4+, you receive 1 CP that can only be spent during that
turn to allow that hero to issue a command.

Heroic Willpower: If the hero is not a **wizard** and it is the
enemy hero phase, they may attempt to unbind 1 spell as if they
were a wizard. If it is your hero phase, that hero may attempt to
dispel 1 endless spell in that phase as if they were a wizard.

Their Finest Hour: Add 1 to wound rolls for their attacks and
add 1 to save rolls for attacks that target that hero, until the
end of that turn. You cannot carry out this heroic action with the
same hero more than once in the same battle.

enemy units and make a 2D6 heroic recovery roll. If the roll is
less than the hero’s BRAVERY, they can heal up to D3 wounds.

## MOVEMENT PHASE

Pick 1 friendly unit more than 3" from all enemy units and
declare it will make a normal move or run, or pick 1 friendly unit
within 3" of an enemy unit and declare that it will retreat. Then
do the same for the other units in your army.

Normal move: Move each model in the unit up to their MOVE.
The unit cannot move within 3" of an enemy unit.

## ARMY BUILDING

When you select a unit to be in your army, you must take
it at the minimum unit size unless it can be taken as an
understrength or reinforced unit. An understrength unit is one
that has fewer models than its min size. You still have to pay its
full cost. A reinforced unit has twice as many models as its min
size, for double its points value. If you can include them in your
army, you can reinforce BATTLELINE units twice: such a unit has
3 times as many models as its minimum size, for triple its points
value, and counts as 2 units towards the number of reinforced
units you can include. A single model cannot be reinforced.

Units have battlefield roles which may limit how many of those
units can be taken. A role may be changed if certain conditions
are met. Such a conditional role is kept for the entire battle.

If a unit is unique, you cannot include more than 1 unit of that
type in your army. The allies list details which factions you can
take allies from, and any restrictions. Allies cannot be generals.

Battalions are formations of specific units that give you access
to additional abilities. In a warscroll battalion, the units are
listed by unit type or keyword. In a core battalion, the units
are listed by unit icon, and are either mandatory or optional.
Battalion abilities in core battalions are listed by icons. If several
icons are separated by a /, you must pick which abilities the
battalion has when you take it for your army.

If the core battalion has the unified icon, after you set up a unit
from the battalion, you must set up all of the other units from
it, one after the other, and you cannot set up any non-battalion
units until they are all set up. If the setup instructions say
players must alternate setting up units one at a time, then after
you set up a unit from the battalion, you must set up all the
other units before your opponent can set up another unit.

## ALLEGIANCE ABILITIES

If all the units in your army are from a single faction, you can use
that faction’s allegiance abilities. These are of 2 types: battle
traits and enhancements.

1 in 4 units in your army can be allied. These are ignored when
determining if the units in the army are from a single faction.

Enhancements are picked after you have chosen your
battalions. You can always take 1 enhancement of each type,
and you may be allowed to take more. They cannot be given to
unique units or allied units, unless noted otherwise. Artefacts of
power and command traits that affect attacks made by friendly
models do not affect attacks made by their mounts, unless
noted otherwise.

Each time you take a command trait enhancement, you can
pick 1 command trait and give it to your general. You can never
pick more than one for your army, and they can only be given to
a general that is a **hero**.

Each time you take an artefact of power enhancement, you can
pick 1 artefact of power and give it to a **hero** in your army. A
hero cannot have more than one.

Each time you take a spell lore of power enhancement, you can
pick 1 spell for each **wizard** in your army from any of the spell
lores available to that wizard (you can pick different spells from
different spell lores for different wizards). Each wizard knows
the spell you picked for them in addition to the other spells they
know.

Each time you take a prayer scripture enhancement, you can
pick 1 prayer for each **priest** in your army from any of the
prayer scriptures available to that priest (you can pick different
prayers from different prayer scriptures for different priests).
Each priest knows the prayer you picked for them in addition to
the other prayers they know.

```
Each time you take a triumph enhancement, you can pick 1
triumph for your army. Each can be used only once per battle,
and can only be used if the points total of your army is less than
that of your opponent’s army.
```
```
A subfaction’s rules may give you access to a further set of
allegiance abilities. If they include a command trait and your
general has that subfaction’s keyword, that command trait must
be the one you give to your general. If a subfaction’s allegiance
abilities include an artefact of power and any heroes in your
army have that subfaction’s keyword, that artefact of power
must be the first artefact of power given to one of those heroes.
```
