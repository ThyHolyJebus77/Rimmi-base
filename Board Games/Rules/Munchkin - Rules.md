## Quick Start Rules Guide

1. Setup:
   - Separate Door and Treasure decks, shuffle both.
   - Deal 4 cards from each deck to each player.

2. On Your Turn:
   a) Kick Open The Door: Draw a Door card face-up.
      - If it's a monster, fight it.
      - If it's a curse, apply it to yourself.
      - If it's anything else, put it in your hand.

   b) Look For Trouble or Loot The Room:
      - If you didn't fight a monster, you can play one from your hand to fight, or
      - Draw another Door card face-down into your hand.

   c) Charity: If you have more than 5 cards, give excess to the player with the lowest level.

   - Gain levels by defeating monsters or using certain cards.
   - You can also sell Items worth 1000 Gold Pieces to gain a level.

6. Player Interaction:
   - Help or hinder others during their combats.
   - Trade items when not in combat.
   - Play Curse cards on other players at any time.

7. Winning:
   - First player to reach Level 10 by defeating a monster wins!

Remember, many cards bend or break these rules. When in doubt, do what the card says!

## Additional Notes
- The game has numerous expansions and themed versions (e.g., sci-fi, superheroes) that add new cards and sometimes new mechanics
- Rules disputes are often settled by owner's decision or group consensus
- The game encourages creative interpretation of card effects and player negotiation

# Munchkin - Rules

#### Running Away

If nobody will help you... or if somebody tries to help, and your fellow
party members interfere so the two of you _still_ cannot win... you must Run
Away. You don’t get any levels or Treasure. You don’t even get to Loot the
Room. And you don’t always escape unharmed...
Roll the die. You escape on a 5 or more. Some Class and Race abilities
and some Treasures make it easier or harder to Run Away from all
monsters. And some monsters give you a bonus or penalty to
your roll for that monster only.

```
If you fail to Run Away from a monster, it does Bad Stuff to you, as
described on its card. This may vary from losing an Item, to losing one or
more levels, to Death (see below).
If you are fleeing from multiple monsters, you roll separately to escape
each one, in any order you choose, and suffer Bad Stuff from each one that
catches you as soon as it catches you.
If two players are cooperating and still can’t defeat the monster(s), they
must both Run Away. They roll separately for each monster, in whatever
order they like. (If they can’t decide, roll the die; the high roller decides who
Runs Away first.) The monster(s) CAN catch them both.
Once you have resolved all Run Away rolls, discard the monster(s).
```
## Death

```
If you die, you lose all your stuff. You keep your Class(es), Race(s),
and Level (and any Curses that were affecting you when you died) – your
new character will look just like your old one. If you have Half-Breed or
Super Munchkin , keep those as well.
Once you have died, you don’t have to Run Away from any remaining
monsters.
Looting The Body: Lay out your hand beside the cards you had in
play (making sure not to include the cards mentioned above). If you have
an Item carried by a Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, separate those
cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, everyone else chooses
one card... in case of ties in Level, roll a die. Once everyone gets one card,
discard the rest. If your corpse runs out of cards, tough. Looted cards go into
players’ hands.
Dead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and
cannot level up or win the game.
When the next player begins their turn, your newly revived character appears
and can help others in combat with your Level and Class or Race abilities...
but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players.
On your next turn, start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck
and playing any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game.
Then take your turn normally.
```
## Curses

```
If drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase, Curse cards
apply to the person who drew them.
If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room , Curse
cards go into your hand and may be played on any player at any
time. Reducing someone’s abilities just as they think they have
killed a monster is a lot of fun.
```
```
Usually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then
discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have
a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the
penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded
to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!)
Note: If someone plays a “your next combat” Curse on you while you are
in combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a “your next turn”
Curse played during your turn.
```
```
If a Curse can apply to more than one
Item, the victim decides which Item is lost
or Cursed.
If a Curse applies to something you don’t
have, ignore it. For instance, if you draw
Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor,
nothing happens; discard the card. (Some
Curses have alternate effects, though, so read
the card!)
There will be times when it will help
you to play a Curse or Monster on
yourself, or to “help” another player in a
way that costs them Treasure. This is very
munchkinly. Do it.
```
#### Munchkin^ brings you the essence of the dungeon-crawling experience^

... without all that messy roleplaying!
    This game includes 168 cards, one six-sided die, and these rules. Three to
six can play. You will need 10 tokens (coins, poker chips, whatever – or any
gadget that counts to 10) for each player.

## Setup

```
Divide the cards into the Door deck and the Treasure deck. Shuffle both
decks. Deal four cards from each deck to each player.
```
#### Card Management

```
Keep separate face-up discard piles for the two decks. You may not look
through the discards unless you play a card that allows you to! When a deck
runs out, reshuffle its discards.
In Play: These are the cards on the table in front of you, showing your
Race and Class (if any) and the Items you are carrying. Continuing Curses
and some other cards also stay on the table after you play them. Cards in play
are public information and must be visible to the other players.
```
```
Your Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but
they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.”
At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand
(see Charity , p. 2).
Cards in play may not be returned to your hand – they must be discarded
or traded if you want to get rid of them.
```
#### Character Creation

```
Everyone starts as a Level 1 human with no class. (Heh, heh.) Munchkin
characters may be either male or female. Your character’s sex is the same as
your own at the start of the game, unless you declare otherwise.
Look at your initial eight cards. If you have any Race or Class cards, you
may (if you like) play one of each type by placing it in front of you. If you
have any usable Items (p. 3), you may
play them by placing them in front
of you. If you have any doubt about
whether you should play a card, you
could read below, or you could just
charge ahead and do it.
```
## Starting and

## Finishing the Game

```
Decide who goes first by rolling the dice and arguing about the results and
the meaning of this sentence and whether the fact that a word seems to be
missing any effect.
Play proceeds in turns, each with several phases (see p. 2). When the first
player finishes a turn, the player to the left takes a turn, and so on.
The first player to reach Level 10 wins... but you must reach Level 10 by
killing a monster, unless a card specifically allows you to win another way.
```
#### Conflicts Between

#### Cards and Rules

```
This rulesheet gives the general rules. Many cards add special rules,
so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the
card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one
of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes
that rule!
```
1. Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects
might reduce a player’s or a monster’s combat strength (p. 3) below 1.
2. You go up a level after combat only if you _kill_ a monster.
3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (e.g., Treasure,
levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before
gaining any rewards.
4. You must _kill a monster_ to reach Level 10, and you cannot force
another player to help you do it.
Any other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the
owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the
**_Munchkin_** FAQ and errata pages at **munchkin.game** , or start a
discussion at **forums.sjgames.com/munchkin**... unless it’s more
fun to argue.

#### Example of Combat,

#### With Numbers and Everything

```
Aric is a 4th-Level Warrior with the Chainsaw of Bloody
Dismemberment (which gives him a +3 to his combat
strength). He kicks open the door and finds the Net Troll, a
Level 10 monster. Aric’s at a 7, the Net Troll is at a 10, so Aric
is losing.
Aric: I was hoping to save this card...
He plays the Magic Missile, giving him +5 for this fight.
Now his combat strength is 12, beating the Net Troll’s 10.
Aric: Ha! Net Troll going down!
Suzan: Not so fast. Now he’s Enraged.
Suzan plays Enraged, adding 5 to the Net Troll’s combat
strength. Now Aric is losing, 15 to 12.
Aric: Curses!
Suzan: Want some help? (Suzan is playing a Level 2 Elf with
the Boots of Butt-Kicking, so her combat strength is 4.
Combined with Aric’s 12, they would have 16, enough to defeat
the Net Troll’s 15.)
Aric: And give you a level? Not a chance! I’m Berserking.
Aric uses his Warrior power and discards three cards: Thief
and a Wandering Monster from his hand, and Yuppie Water
(usable only to help an Elf) from his carried items. Each one
gives him +1 to his combat strength.
Suzan: Not the Yuppie Water! Noooo...
Aric: That’s +3 to me, and now we’re tied, 15 to 15. Because I’m a
Warrior, I win ties... so I’m killing the Net Troll unless someone else
plans to mess with me. Anyone?
No one says anything, so Aric goes up a level and claims the
Net Troll’s treasures – three from the Net Troll card, and one
extra because it was Enraged. And the game goes on...

#### Super-Sized Munchkin

```
Studies have shown that 8.4 out of 9.7 Munchkin players just can’t
get enough of the game. Here are some ideas to take your Munchkin
games to new heights – or lows:
Combining different Munchkin sets. You can mix two (or
more) base sets and expansions together for a genre-crossing mega-
Munchkin adventure! Space plus Old West? Kung fu vampires? No
problem!
Expansions. These add still more monsters to kill, new Treasure
to loot, and sometimes entirely new kinds of cards. Ask for all the
Munchkin sets and expansions at your local game or comic store –
find it using our Store Finder, storefinder.sjgames.com – but if you
don’t have a local store, we’ll be happy to sell them directly to you at
warehouse23.com.
All of the above!!!
```
#### Faster Play Rules

```
For a faster game, you can add a “phase 0” called Listen At The
Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a
face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards
and Kick Open The Door normally. If you Loot The Room, draw a
face-down Treasure , not a Door.
You can also allow shared victories – if a player reaches Level 10 in
a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what
Level you are.

## munchkin.game


## Turn Phases

Your turn begins as soon as the previous
player’s turn ends. When your cards are arranged
the way you want, go to phase 1.

**(1) Kick Open The Door:** Draw one card from
the Door deck and turn it face up.
If it’s a monster, you must fight it. See **Combat** ,
p. 3. If the card is a curse – see **Curses** , p. 5 – it applies
to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has
a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an
upcoming effect).
If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it
immediately.

**(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room:** If you fought a monster in
phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3.
If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have
two choices: either **Look For Trouble** or **Loot The Room.**

**Look For Trouble:** Play a monster _from your hand_ and fight it, just
as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster
you can’t handle, unless you’re sure you can count on getting help (see p. 4)!
**Loot The Room:** Draw a second card from the **Door** deck, face **down** ,
and place it in your hand.

**(3) Charity:** If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play
enough cards to get you to five or below – for instance, you can play Curses,
sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce
your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to
the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards
as evenly as possible, but it’s up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers.
If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.

```
As soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player’s turn begins.
```
## Character Stats

```
Each character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items,
with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe
your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking ,
a Staff of Napalm , and the Kneepads of Allure .”
Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When
the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number.
You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do.
You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items ).
You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can
never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be
negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other
kind of penalty.
Class: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or
Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class.
Yeah, I know, we did that one already.
Each Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the
abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and
lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are
powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your
hand, to power a special ability.
See the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note
that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting –
and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!
You can discard a Class card at any time, even in
combat: “I don’t wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class
card, you become classless until you play another Class card.
You may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the
Super Munchkin card.
Race: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you
have no Race card in front of you, you are human.
Humans have no special abilities. The rules for Classes, above, also apply
to Races.
You may not belong to more than one race at once
unless you play the Half-Breed card.
```
#### Super Munchkin

#### and Half-Breed

```
These cards may be played whenever
it is legal to play a Class or Race, as
long as you have an appropriate card
(Class for Super Munchkin , Race for
Half-Breed ) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same
Class or Race card in play at once.
```
```
If you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages
of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with
penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the
disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and
monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class
has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it – you
aren’t that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two
Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both
Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed , just for Races.)
```
## Treasures

```
Treasure cards include permanent and “one-shot” cards. Any
Treasure card may be played to the table as soon as you get it, or at
any time on your own turn except during combat (unless the rules
below or the card itself says otherwise).
```
#### Items

```
Most Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is
equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.
All Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually
giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not
equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your
Items during a combat or while running away.
Anyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you
may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and
two “1 Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item)... unless you have a card that
lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat! , or unless one of
the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance,
you can equip only one of them at a time.
Likewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of
Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for
someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.
You cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a
level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who
wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race
abilities. And a Curse or a monster’s Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to
get rid of something!
Big Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big
one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard
one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a
Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.
If something lets you have more than one Big item (for instance, the
Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either correct the problem
immediately or get rid of all but one Big item. If it’s your turn and you’re
not in combat, you can sell the excess Big items (as long as you have at least
```
```
1,000 Gold Pieces of Items to sell). Otherwise, you must give them to the
lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over,
discard them.
Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players.
You may only trade Items from the table – not from your hand. You
may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in
combat – in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn. Any
Item you receive in a trade must remain in play.
You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players –
“I’ll give you my Flaming Armor if you won’t help Bob fight that dragon!”
You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you.
Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except
during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of
at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value”
cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance)
1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don’t get change. But if you can
manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so
on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are
carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.
```
#### “One-Shot” Treasures

```
A Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot”
Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins
or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some
have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as
soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.
One-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like
other Items.
```
#### Other Treasures

```
Other Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of
these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are
discarded. A couple of specific examples:
```
```
Go Up a Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any
time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception:
You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!
Hireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a
Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.
```
## Combat

```
To fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat
strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers – positive or negative –
given by Items and other cards. If the monster’s combat strength is
equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run
Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the
monster’s – note that monsters win ties! – you kill it and go up a
level (two levels for some big monsters). You’ll also get the number
of Treasures shown on its card.
Sometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without
killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don’t get a level. Unless
the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the
last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.
Some monster cards have special powers that affect combat
```
- a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to
check these!

```
You and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or
Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may
also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).
If you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other
cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile
card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you
kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds,
for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and
you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.
```
#### Monsters

```
If drawn face-up, during the Kick Open The Door phase, monsters
immediately attack the person who drew them.
If you get a monster card any other way, it goes into your hand and may
be played during your own turn to Look For Trouble , or played to join
another player’s fight with the Wandering Monster card. (See Fighting
Multiple Monsters , below.)
Each monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card
is plural.
```
#### Monster Enhancers

```
Certain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength
of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.)
They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster
enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.
All enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple
monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose
which monster it applies to.
Exception: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate... if
Ancient , Enraged , and Mate are played on a single monster, in any order ,
you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.
Good luck...
```
#### Fighting Multiple Monsters

```
Some cards (such as Wandering Monster ) allow your rivals to send
other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat
strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level
only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate
one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot
choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one
monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!
```
#### Undead Monsters

```
Several monsters in this set are tagged Undead. You may play any
Undead monster from your hand into combat to help any other Undead,
without using a Wandering Monster card. If you have a card that can
be used to make a monster Undead, you may play it with a non-Undead
monster to use this rule.
```
#### Asking For Help

```
If you cannot win a combat on your own, you may ask any other player
to help you. If he refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until
they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help
you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to
affect your combat, however!
```
```
You’ll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper
any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards
the monster has. If you offer part of the monster’s Treasure, you must agree
whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to
play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level
cards, on your helper.
The special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your
helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if
your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and
discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat,
not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a
Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing
the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster’s combat strength is
increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster’s combat strength
has already been increased).
If someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw
Treasures (see Rewards , below), and follow any special instructions on the
monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up
any levels... unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for
each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper’s
special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the
agreement you reached.
A few cards or abilities allow you to compel another player to help you in
combat. These abilities do not work if you are fighting for the win – and if
you force someone to help and then the fight becomes one for the win, your
helper gets to back out without penalty. However, if you voluntarily help
someone, you don’t get to back out just because they’re about to win the
game – so pay attention!
```
#### Rewards

```
When you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the
monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster
has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures,
modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you
killed the monster alone. Draw face-up , so the whole party can see what you
got, if someone helped you, even if they aren’t taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)
If you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you
may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.
Treasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are
the helper.
```
#### When You May Take Actions

```
You may perform these actions at any time:
Discard a Class or Race.
Play a Go Up a Level or Hireling.
Play a Curse.
```
```
You may perform these actions at any time, as long as you are not
in combat:
Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be
in combat, either).
Change which Items you have equipped.
Play a card that you have just received (some cards may be
played even during combat; see above).
```
```
You may perform these actions on your own turn:
Play a new Class or Race card (at any time).
Sell Items for levels (except when you are in combat).
Play an Item (most Items cannot be played during
combat, but some one-shot Items can; see p. 3).
```
#### Combat: Basic Rules

```
When you fight a monster, you compare your combat strength
(your Level plus any bonuses or penalties) against the monster’s
combat strength. If your combat strength is greater, you win! If it is
tied or lower, the monster wins.
For the full explanation, see Combat , p. 3.
```
#### Level Counters: It’s Not Cheating,

#### It’s Using the Rules!

```
If you have an iOS or Android device, you’ll like our Level Counter
app. Just search for “ Munchkin level counter” or click the link at
levelcounter.sjgames.com. Even better, it gives you personal in-
game advantages to make your friends jealous... which is what being
a munchkin is all about!
```
#### Interfering With Combat

```
You can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including:
```
```
Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a
one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally”
strengthen the monster with it, instead...
Play a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster
stronger... and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during
your own combats or during someone else’s combat.
Add a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a
Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.
Backstab a player in combat, if you’re a Thief.
Curse them, if you have a Curse card.
```

## Turn Phases

Your turn begins as soon as the previous
player’s turn ends. When your cards are arranged
the way you want, go to phase 1.

**(1) Kick Open The Door:** Draw one card from
the Door deck and turn it face up.
If it’s a monster, you must fight it. See **Combat** ,
p. 3. If the card is a curse – see **Curses** , p. 5 – it applies
to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has
a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an
upcoming effect).
If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it
immediately.

**(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room:** If you fought a monster in
phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3.
If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have
two choices: either **Look For Trouble** or **Loot The Room.**

**Look For Trouble:** Play a monster _from your hand_ and fight it, just
as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster
you can’t handle, unless you’re sure you can count on getting help (see p. 4)!
**Loot The Room:** Draw a second card from the **Door** deck, face **down** ,
and place it in your hand.

**(3) Charity:** If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play
enough cards to get you to five or below – for instance, you can play Curses,
sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce
your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to
the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards
as evenly as possible, but it’s up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers.
If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.

```
As soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player’s turn begins.
```
## Character Stats

```
Each character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items,
with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe
your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking ,
a Staff of Napalm , and the Kneepads of Allure .”
Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When
the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number.
You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do.
You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items ).
You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can
never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be
negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other
kind of penalty.
Class: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or
Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class.
Yeah, I know, we did that one already.
Each Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the
abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and
lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are
powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your
hand, to power a special ability.
See the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note
that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting –
and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!
You can discard a Class card at any time, even in
combat: “I don’t wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class
card, you become classless until you play another Class card.
You may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the
Super Munchkin card.
Race: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you
have no Race card in front of you, you are human.
Humans have no special abilities. The rules for Classes, above, also apply
to Races.
You may not belong to more than one race at once
unless you play the Half-Breed card.
```
#### Super Munchkin

#### and Half-Breed

```
These cards may be played whenever
it is legal to play a Class or Race, as
long as you have an appropriate card
(Class for Super Munchkin , Race for
Half-Breed ) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same
Class or Race card in play at once.
```
```
If you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages
of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with
penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the
disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and
monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class
has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it – you
aren’t that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two
Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both
Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed , just for Races.)
```
## Treasures

```
Treasure cards include permanent and “one-shot” cards. Any
Treasure card may be played to the table as soon as you get it, or at
any time on your own turn except during combat (unless the rules
below or the card itself says otherwise).
```
#### Items

```
Most Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is
equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.
All Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually
giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not
equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your
Items during a combat or while running away.
Anyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you
may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and
two “1 Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item)... unless you have a card that
lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat! , or unless one of
the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance,
you can equip only one of them at a time.
Likewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of
Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for
someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.
You cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a
level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who
wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race
abilities. And a Curse or a monster’s Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to
get rid of something!
Big Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big
one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard
one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a
Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.
If something lets you have more than one Big item (for instance, the
Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either correct the problem
immediately or get rid of all but one Big item. If it’s your turn and you’re
not in combat, you can sell the excess Big items (as long as you have at least
```
```
1,000 Gold Pieces of Items to sell). Otherwise, you must give them to the
lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over,
discard them.
Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players.
You may only trade Items from the table – not from your hand. You
may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in
combat – in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn. Any
Item you receive in a trade must remain in play.
You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players –
“I’ll give you my Flaming Armor if you won’t help Bob fight that dragon!”
You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you.
Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except
during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of
at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value”
cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance)
1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don’t get change. But if you can
manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so
on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are
carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.
```
#### “One-Shot” Treasures

```
A Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot”
Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins
or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some
have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as
soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.
One-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like
other Items.
```
#### Other Treasures

```
Other Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of
these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are
discarded. A couple of specific examples:
```
```
Go Up a Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any
time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception:
You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!
Hireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a
Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.
```
## Combat

```
To fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat
strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers – positive or negative –
given by Items and other cards. If the monster’s combat strength is
equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run
Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the
monster’s – note that monsters win ties! – you kill it and go up a
level (two levels for some big monsters). You’ll also get the number
of Treasures shown on its card.
Sometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without
killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don’t get a level. Unless
the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the
last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.
Some monster cards have special powers that affect combat
```
- a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to
check these!

```
You and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or
Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may
also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).
If you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other
cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile
card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you
kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds,
for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and
you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.
```
#### Monsters

```
If drawn face-up, during the Kick Open The Door phase, monsters
immediately attack the person who drew them.
If you get a monster card any other way, it goes into your hand and may
be played during your own turn to Look For Trouble , or played to join
another player’s fight with the Wandering Monster card. (See Fighting
Multiple Monsters , below.)
Each monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card
is plural.
```
#### Monster Enhancers

```
Certain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength
of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.)
They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster
enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.
All enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple
monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose
which monster it applies to.
Exception: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate... if
Ancient , Enraged , and Mate are played on a single monster, in any order ,
you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.
Good luck...
```
#### Fighting Multiple Monsters

```
Some cards (such as Wandering Monster ) allow your rivals to send
other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat
strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level
only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate
one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot
choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one
monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!
```
#### Undead Monsters

```
Several monsters in this set are tagged Undead. You may play any
Undead monster from your hand into combat to help any other Undead,
without using a Wandering Monster card. If you have a card that can
be used to make a monster Undead, you may play it with a non-Undead
monster to use this rule.
```
#### Asking For Help

```
If you cannot win a combat on your own, you may ask any other player
to help you. If he refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until
they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help
you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to
affect your combat, however!
```
```
You’ll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper
any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards
the monster has. If you offer part of the monster’s Treasure, you must agree
whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to
play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level
cards, on your helper.
The special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your
helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if
your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and
discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat,
not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a
Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing
the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster’s combat strength is
increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster’s combat strength
has already been increased).
If someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw
Treasures (see Rewards , below), and follow any special instructions on the
monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up
any levels... unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for
each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper’s
special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the
agreement you reached.
A few cards or abilities allow you to compel another player to help you in
combat. These abilities do not work if you are fighting for the win – and if
you force someone to help and then the fight becomes one for the win, your
helper gets to back out without penalty. However, if you voluntarily help
someone, you don’t get to back out just because they’re about to win the
game – so pay attention!
```
#### Rewards

```
When you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the
monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster
has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures,
modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you
killed the monster alone. Draw face-up , so the whole party can see what you
got, if someone helped you, even if they aren’t taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)
If you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you
may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.
Treasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are
the helper.
```
#### When You May Take Actions

```
You may perform these actions at any time:
Discard a Class or Race.
Play a Go Up a Level or Hireling.
Play a Curse.
```
```
You may perform these actions at any time, as long as you are not
in combat:
Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be
in combat, either).
Change which Items you have equipped.
Play a card that you have just received (some cards may be
played even during combat; see above).
```
```
You may perform these actions on your own turn:
Play a new Class or Race card (at any time).
Sell Items for levels (except when you are in combat).
Play an Item (most Items cannot be played during
combat, but some one-shot Items can; see p. 3).
```
#### Combat: Basic Rules

```
When you fight a monster, you compare your combat strength
(your Level plus any bonuses or penalties) against the monster’s
combat strength. If your combat strength is greater, you win! If it is
tied or lower, the monster wins.
For the full explanation, see Combat , p. 3.
```
#### Level Counters: It’s Not Cheating,

#### It’s Using the Rules!

If you have an iOS or Android device, you’ll like our Level Counter
app. Just search for “ Munchkin level counter” or click the link at
levelcounter.sjgames.com. Even better, it gives you personal in-
game advantages to make your friends jealous... which is what being
a munchkin is all about!
```
#### Interfering With Combat

```
You can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including:
```
```
Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a
one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally”
strengthen the monster with it, instead...
Play a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster
stronger... and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during
your own combats or during someone else’s combat.
Add a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a
Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.
Backstab a player in combat, if you’re a Thief.
Curse them, if you have a Curse card.
```

## Turn Phases

Your turn begins as soon as the previous
player’s turn ends. When your cards are arranged
the way you want, go to phase 1.

**(1) Kick Open The Door:** Draw one card from
the Door deck and turn it face up.
If it’s a monster, you must fight it. See **Combat** ,
p. 3. If the card is a curse – see **Curses** , p. 5 – it applies
to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has
a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an
upcoming effect).
If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it
immediately.

**(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room:** If you fought a monster in
phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3.
If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have
two choices: either **Look For Trouble** or **Loot The Room.**

**Look For Trouble:** Play a monster _from your hand_ and fight it, just
as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster
you can’t handle, unless you’re sure you can count on getting help (see p. 4)!
**Loot The Room:** Draw a second card from the **Door** deck, face **down** ,
and place it in your hand.

**(3) Charity:** If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play
enough cards to get you to five or below – for instance, you can play Curses,
sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce
your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to
the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards
as evenly as possible, but it’s up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers.
If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.

```
As soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player’s turn begins.
```
## Character Stats

```
Each character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items,
with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe
your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking ,
a Staff of Napalm , and the Kneepads of Allure .”
Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When
the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number.
You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do.
You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items ).
You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can
never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be
negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other
kind of penalty.
Class: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or
Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class.
Yeah, I know, we did that one already.
Each Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the
abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and
lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are
powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your
hand, to power a special ability.
See the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note
that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting –
and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!
You can discard a Class card at any time, even in
combat: “I don’t wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class
card, you become classless until you play another Class card.
You may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the
Super Munchkin card.
Race: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you
have no Race card in front of you, you are human.
Humans have no special abilities. The rules for Classes, above, also apply
to Races.
You may not belong to more than one race at once
unless you play the Half-Breed card.
```
#### Super Munchkin

#### and Half-Breed

```
These cards may be played whenever
it is legal to play a Class or Race, as
long as you have an appropriate card
(Class for Super Munchkin , Race for
Half-Breed ) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same
Class or Race card in play at once.
```
```
If you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages
of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with
penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the
disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and
monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class
has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it – you
aren’t that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two
Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both
Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed , just for Races.)
```
## Treasures

```
Treasure cards include permanent and “one-shot” cards. Any
Treasure card may be played to the table as soon as you get it, or at
any time on your own turn except during combat (unless the rules
below or the card itself says otherwise).
```
#### Items

```
Most Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is
equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.
All Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually
giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not
equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your
Items during a combat or while running away.
Anyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you
may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and
two “1 Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item)... unless you have a card that
lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat! , or unless one of
the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance,
you can equip only one of them at a time.
Likewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of
Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for
someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.
You cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a
level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who
wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race
abilities. And a Curse or a monster’s Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to
get rid of something!
Big Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big
one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard
one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a
Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.
If something lets you have more than one Big item (for instance, the
Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either correct the problem
immediately or get rid of all but one Big item. If it’s your turn and you’re
not in combat, you can sell the excess Big items (as long as you have at least
```
```
1,000 Gold Pieces of Items to sell). Otherwise, you must give them to the
lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over,
discard them.
Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players.
You may only trade Items from the table – not from your hand. You
may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in
combat – in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn. Any
Item you receive in a trade must remain in play.
You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players –
“I’ll give you my Flaming Armor if you won’t help Bob fight that dragon!”
You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you.
Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except
during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of
at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value”
cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance)
1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don’t get change. But if you can
manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so
on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are
carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.
```
#### “One-Shot” Treasures

```
A Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot”
Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins
or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some
have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as
soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.
One-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like
other Items.
```
#### Other Treasures

```
Other Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of
these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are
discarded. A couple of specific examples:
```
```
Go Up a Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any
time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception:
You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!
Hireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a
Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.
```
## Combat

```
To fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat
strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers – positive or negative –
given by Items and other cards. If the monster’s combat strength is
equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run
Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the
monster’s – note that monsters win ties! – you kill it and go up a
level (two levels for some big monsters). You’ll also get the number
of Treasures shown on its card.
Sometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without
killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don’t get a level. Unless
the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the
last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.
Some monster cards have special powers that affect combat
```
- a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to
check these!

```
You and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or
Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may
also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).
If you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other
cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile
card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you
kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds,
for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and
you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.
```
#### Monsters

```
If drawn face-up, during the Kick Open The Door phase, monsters
immediately attack the person who drew them.
If you get a monster card any other way, it goes into your hand and may
be played during your own turn to Look For Trouble , or played to join
another player’s fight with the Wandering Monster card. (See Fighting
Multiple Monsters , below.)
Each monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card
is plural.
```
#### Monster Enhancers

```
Certain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength
of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.)
They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster
enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.
All enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple
monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose
which monster it applies to.
Exception: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate... if
Ancient , Enraged , and Mate are played on a single monster, in any order ,
you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.
Good luck...
```
#### Fighting Multiple Monsters

```
Some cards (such as Wandering Monster ) allow your rivals to send
other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat
strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level
only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate
one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot
choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one
monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!
```
#### Undead Monsters

```
Several monsters in this set are tagged Undead. You may play any
Undead monster from your hand into combat to help any other Undead,
without using a Wandering Monster card. If you have a card that can
be used to make a monster Undead, you may play it with a non-Undead
monster to use this rule.
```
#### Asking For Help

```
If you cannot win a combat on your own, you may ask any other player
to help you. If he refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until
they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help
you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to
affect your combat, however!
```
```
You’ll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper
any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards
the monster has. If you offer part of the monster’s Treasure, you must agree
whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to
play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level
cards, on your helper.
The special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your
helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if
your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and
discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat,
not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a
Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing
the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster’s combat strength is
increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster’s combat strength
has already been increased).
If someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw
Treasures (see Rewards , below), and follow any special instructions on the
monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up
any levels... unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for
each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper’s
special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the
agreement you reached.
A few cards or abilities allow you to compel another player to help you in
combat. These abilities do not work if you are fighting for the win – and if
you force someone to help and then the fight becomes one for the win, your
helper gets to back out without penalty. However, if you voluntarily help
someone, you don’t get to back out just because they’re about to win the
game – so pay attention!
```
#### Rewards

```
When you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the
monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster
has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures,
modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you
killed the monster alone. Draw face-up , so the whole party can see what you
got, if someone helped you, even if they aren’t taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)
If you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you
may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.
Treasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are
the helper.
```
#### When You May Take Actions

```
You may perform these actions at any time:
Discard a Class or Race.
Play a Go Up a Level or Hireling.
Play a Curse.
```
```
You may perform these actions at any time, as long as you are not
in combat:
Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be
in combat, either).
Change which Items you have equipped.
Play a card that you have just received (some cards may be
played even during combat; see above).
```
```
You may perform these actions on your own turn:
Play a new Class or Race card (at any time).
Sell Items for levels (except when you are in combat).
Play an Item (most Items cannot be played during
combat, but some one-shot Items can; see p. 3).
```
#### Combat: Basic Rules

```
When you fight a monster, you compare your combat strength
(your Level plus any bonuses or penalties) against the monster’s
combat strength. If your combat strength is greater, you win! If it is
tied or lower, the monster wins.
For the full explanation, see Combat , p. 3.
```
#### Level Counters: It’s Not Cheating,

#### It’s Using the Rules!

```
If you have an iOS or Android device, you’ll like our Level Counter
app. Just search for “ Munchkin level counter” or click the link at
levelcounter.sjgames.com. Even better, it gives you personal in-
game advantages to make your friends jealous... which is what being
a munchkin is all about!
```
#### Interfering With Combat

```
You can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including:
```
```
Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a
one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally”
strengthen the monster with it, instead...
Play a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster
stronger... and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during
your own combats or during someone else’s combat.
Add a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a
Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.
Backstab a player in combat, if you’re a Thief.
Curse them, if you have a Curse card.
```

#### Running Away

If nobody will help you... or if somebody tries to help, and your fellow
party members interfere so the two of you _still_ cannot win... you must Run
Away. You don’t get any levels or Treasure. You don’t even get to Loot the
Room. And you don’t always escape unharmed...
Roll the die. You escape on a 5 or more. Some Class and Race abilities
and some Treasures make it easier or harder to Run Away from all
monsters. And some monsters give you a bonus or penalty to
your roll for that monster only.

```
If you fail to Run Away from a monster, it does Bad Stuff to you, as
described on its card. This may vary from losing an Item, to losing one or
more levels, to Death (see below).
If you are fleeing from multiple monsters, you roll separately to escape
each one, in any order you choose, and suffer Bad Stuff from each one that
catches you as soon as it catches you.
If two players are cooperating and still can’t defeat the monster(s), they
must both Run Away. They roll separately for each monster, in whatever
order they like. (If they can’t decide, roll the die; the high roller decides who
Runs Away first.) The monster(s) CAN catch them both.
Once you have resolved all Run Away rolls, discard the monster(s).
```
## Death

```
If you die, you lose all your stuff. You keep your Class(es), Race(s),
and Level (and any Curses that were affecting you when you died) – your
new character will look just like your old one. If you have Half-Breed or
Super Munchkin , keep those as well.
Once you have died, you don’t have to Run Away from any remaining
monsters.
Looting The Body: Lay out your hand beside the cards you had in
play (making sure not to include the cards mentioned above). If you have
an Item carried by a Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, separate those
cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, everyone else chooses
one card... in case of ties in Level, roll a die. Once everyone gets one card,
discard the rest. If your corpse runs out of cards, tough. Looted cards go into
players’ hands.
Dead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and
cannot level up or win the game.
When the next player begins their turn, your newly revived character appears
and can help others in combat with your Level and Class or Race abilities...
but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players.
On your next turn, start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck
and playing any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game.
Then take your turn normally.
```
## Curses

```
If drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase, Curse cards
apply to the person who drew them.
If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room , Curse
cards go into your hand and may be played on any player at any
time. Reducing someone’s abilities just as they think they have
killed a monster is a lot of fun.
```
```
Usually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then
discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have
a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the
penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded
to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!)
Note: If someone plays a “your next combat” Curse on you while you are
in combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a “your next turn”
Curse played during your turn.
```
```
If a Curse can apply to more than one
Item, the victim decides which Item is lost
or Cursed.
If a Curse applies to something you don’t
have, ignore it. For instance, if you draw
Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor,
nothing happens; discard the card. (Some
Curses have alternate effects, though, so read
the card!)
There will be times when it will help
you to play a Curse or Monster on
yourself, or to “help” another player in a
way that costs them Treasure. This is very
munchkinly. Do it.
```
#### Munchkin^ brings you the essence of the dungeon-crawling experience^

... without all that messy roleplaying!
    This game includes 168 cards, one six-sided die, and these rules. Three to
six can play. You will need 10 tokens (coins, poker chips, whatever – or any
gadget that counts to 10) for each player.

## Setup

```
Divide the cards into the Door deck and the Treasure deck. Shuffle both
decks. Deal four cards from each deck to each player.
```
#### Card Management

```
Keep separate face-up discard piles for the two decks. You may not look
through the discards unless you play a card that allows you to! When a deck
runs out, reshuffle its discards.
In Play: These are the cards on the table in front of you, showing your
Race and Class (if any) and the Items you are carrying. Continuing Curses
and some other cards also stay on the table after you play them. Cards in play
are public information and must be visible to the other players.
```
```
Your Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but
they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.”
At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand
(see Charity , p. 2).
Cards in play may not be returned to your hand – they must be discarded
or traded if you want to get rid of them.
```
#### Character Creation

```
Everyone starts as a Level 1 human with no class. (Heh, heh.) Munchkin
characters may be either male or female. Your character’s sex is the same as
your own at the start of the game, unless you declare otherwise.
Look at your initial eight cards. If you have any Race or Class cards, you
may (if you like) play one of each type by placing it in front of you. If you
have any usable Items (p. 3), you may
play them by placing them in front
of you. If you have any doubt about
whether you should play a card, you
could read below, or you could just
charge ahead and do it.
```
## Starting and

## Finishing the Game

```
Decide who goes first by rolling the dice and arguing about the results and
the meaning of this sentence and whether the fact that a word seems to be
missing any effect.
Play proceeds in turns, each with several phases (see p. 2). When the first
player finishes a turn, the player to the left takes a turn, and so on.
The first player to reach Level 10 wins... but you must reach Level 10 by
killing a monster, unless a card specifically allows you to win another way.
```
#### Conflicts Between

#### Cards and Rules

```
This rulesheet gives the general rules. Many cards add special rules,
so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the
card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one
of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes
that rule!
```
1. Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects
might reduce a player’s or a monster’s combat strength (p. 3) below 1.
2. You go up a level after combat only if you _kill_ a monster.
3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (e.g., Treasure,
levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before
gaining any rewards.
4. You must _kill a monster_ to reach Level 10, and you cannot force
another player to help you do it.

```
Any other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the
owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the
Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game , or start a
discussion at forums.sjgames.com/munchkin... unless it’s more
fun to argue.
```
#### Example of Combat,

#### With Numbers and Everything

```
Aric is a 4th-Level Warrior with the Chainsaw of Bloody
Dismemberment (which gives him a +3 to his combat
strength). He kicks open the door and finds the Net Troll, a
Level 10 monster. Aric’s at a 7, the Net Troll is at a 10, so Aric
is losing.
Aric: I was hoping to save this card...
He plays the Magic Missile, giving him +5 for this fight.
Now his combat strength is 12, beating the Net Troll’s 10.
Aric: Ha! Net Troll going down!
Suzan: Not so fast. Now he’s Enraged.
Suzan plays Enraged, adding 5 to the Net Troll’s combat
strength. Now Aric is losing, 15 to 12.
Aric: Curses!
Suzan: Want some help? (Suzan is playing a Level 2 Elf with
the Boots of Butt-Kicking, so her combat strength is 4.
Combined with Aric’s 12, they would have 16, enough to defeat
the Net Troll’s 15.)
Aric: And give you a level? Not a chance! I’m Berserking.
Aric uses his Warrior power and discards three cards: Thief
and a Wandering Monster from his hand, and Yuppie Water
(usable only to help an Elf) from his carried items. Each one
gives him +1 to his combat strength.
Suzan: Not the Yuppie Water! Noooo...
Aric: That’s +3 to me, and now we’re tied, 15 to 15. Because I’m a
Warrior, I win ties... so I’m killing the Net Troll unless someone else
plans to mess with me. Anyone?
No one says anything, so Aric goes up a level and claims the
Net Troll’s treasures – three from the Net Troll card, and one
extra because it was Enraged. And the game goes on...

#### Super-Sized Munchkin

```
Studies have shown that 8.4 out of 9.7 Munchkin players just can’t
get enough of the game. Here are some ideas to take your Munchkin
games to new heights – or lows:
Combining different Munchkin sets. You can mix two (or
more) base sets and expansions together for a genre-crossing mega-
Munchkin adventure! Space plus Old West? Kung fu vampires? No
problem!
Expansions. These add still more monsters to kill, new Treasure
to loot, and sometimes entirely new kinds of cards. Ask for all the
Munchkin sets and expansions at your local game or comic store –
find it using our Store Finder, storefinder.sjgames.com – but if you
don’t have a local store, we’ll be happy to sell them directly to you at
warehouse23.com.
All of the above!!!
```
#### Faster Play Rules

```
For a faster game, you can add a “phase 0” called Listen At The
Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a
face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards
and Kick Open The Door normally. If you Loot The Room, draw a
face-down Treasure , not a Door.
You can also allow shared victories – if a player reaches Level 10 in
a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what
Level you are.

#### Running Away

If nobody will help you... or if somebody tries to help, and your fellow
party members interfere so the two of you _still_ cannot win... you must Run
Away. You don’t get any levels or Treasure. You don’t even get to Loot the
Room. And you don’t always escape unharmed...
Roll the die. You escape on a 5 or more. Some Class and Race abilities
and some Treasures make it easier or harder to Run Away from all
monsters. And some monsters give you a bonus or penalty to
your roll for that monster only.

```
If you fail to Run Away from a monster, it does Bad Stuff to you, as
described on its card. This may vary from losing an Item, to losing one or
more levels, to Death (see below).
If you are fleeing from multiple monsters, you roll separately to escape
each one, in any order you choose, and suffer Bad Stuff from each one that
catches you as soon as it catches you.
If two players are cooperating and still can’t defeat the monster(s), they
must both Run Away. They roll separately for each monster, in whatever
order they like. (If they can’t decide, roll the die; the high roller decides who
Runs Away first.) The monster(s) CAN catch them both.
Once you have resolved all Run Away rolls, discard the monster(s).
```
## Death

```
If you die, you lose all your stuff. You keep your Class(es), Race(s),
and Level (and any Curses that were affecting you when you died) – your
new character will look just like your old one. If you have Half-Breed or
Super Munchkin , keep those as well.

but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players.
On your next turn, start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck
and playing any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game.
Then take your turn normally.
```
## Curses

```
If drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase, Curse cards
apply to the person who drew them.
If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room , Curse
cards go into your hand and may be played on any player at any
time. Reducing someone’s abilities just as they think they have
killed a monster is a lot of fun.
```
```
Usually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then
discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have
a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the
penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded
to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!)
Note: If someone plays a “your next combat” Curse on you while you are
in combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a “your next turn”
Curse played during your turn.
```
```
If a Curse can apply to more than one
Item, the victim decides which Item is lost
or Cursed.
If a Curse applies to something you don’t
have, ignore it. For instance, if you draw
Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor,
nothing happens; discard the card. (Some
Curses have alternate effects, though, so read
the card!)
There will be times when it will help
you to play a Curse or Monster on
yourself, or to “help” another player in a

killing a monster, unless a card specifically allows you to win another way.
```
#### Conflicts Between

#### Cards and Rules

```
This rulesheet gives the general rules. Many cards add special rules,
so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the
card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one
of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes
that rule!
```
1. Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects
might reduce a player’s or a monster’s combat strength (p. 3) below 1.
2. You go up a level after combat only if you _kill_ a monster.
3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (e.g., Treasure,
levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before
gaining any rewards.
4. You must _kill a monster_ to reach Level 10, and you cannot force
another player to help you do it.
Any other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the
owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the
**_Munchkin_** FAQ and errata pages at **munchkin.game** , or start a
discussion at **forums.sjgames.com/munchkin**... unless it’s more
fun to argue.

#### Example of Combat,

#### With Numbers and Everything

```
Aric is a 4th-Level Warrior with the Chainsaw of Bloody
Dismemberment (which gives him a +3 to his combat
strength). He kicks open the door and finds the Net Troll, a
Level 10 monster. Aric’s at a 7, the Net Troll is at a 10, so Aric
is losing.
Aric: I was hoping to save this card...
He plays the Magic Missile, giving him +5 for this fight.
Now his combat strength is 12, beating the Net Troll’s 10.
Aric: Ha! Net Troll going down!
Suzan: Not so fast. Now he’s Enraged.
Suzan plays Enraged, adding 5 to the Net Troll’s combat
strength. Now Aric is losing, 15 to 12.
Aric: Curses!
Suzan: Want some help? (Suzan is playing a Level 2 Elf with
the Boots of Butt-Kicking, so her combat strength is 4.
Combined with Aric’s 12, they would have 16, enough to defeat
the Net Troll’s 15.)
Aric: And give you a level? Not a chance! I’m Berserking.
Aric uses his Warrior power and discards three cards: Thief
and a Wandering Monster from his hand, and Yuppie Water
(usable only to help an Elf) from his carried items. Each one
gives him +1 to his combat strength.
Suzan: Not the Yuppie Water! Noooo...
Aric: That’s +3 to me, and now we’re tied, 15 to 15. Because I’m a
Warrior, I win ties... so I’m killing the Net Troll unless someone else
plans to mess with me. Anyone?
No one says anything, so Aric goes up a level and claims the
Net Troll’s treasures – three from the Net Troll card, and one
extra because it was Enraged. And the game goes on...

#### Super-Sized Munchkin

```
Studies have shown that 8.4 out of 9.7 Munchkin players just can’t
get enough of the game. Here are some ideas to take your Munchkin
games to new heights – or lows:
Combining different Munchkin sets. You can mix two (or
more) base sets and expansions together for a genre-crossing mega-
Munchkin adventure! Space plus Old West? Kung fu vampires? No
problem!
Expansions. These add still more monsters to kill, new Treasure
to loot, and sometimes entirely new kinds of cards. Ask for all the
Munchkin sets and expansions at your local game or comic store –
find it using our Store Finder, storefinder.sjgames.com – but if you
don’t have a local store, we’ll be happy to sell them directly to you at
warehouse23.com.
All of the above!!!
```
#### Faster Play Rules

```
For a faster game, you can add a “phase 0” called Listen At The
Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a
face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards
and Kick Open The Door normally. If you Loot The Room, draw a
face-down Treasure , not a Door.
You can also allow shared victories – if a player reaches Level 10 in
a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what
Level you are.
