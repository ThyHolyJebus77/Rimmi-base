# Mysterium
## Brief Summary
Mysterium is a cooperative deduction game where one player takes on the role of a ghost trying to communicate with psychics (other players) through abstract vision cards. The psychics must interpret these visions to solve a murder mystery by identifying the correct character, location, and object for each player within a limited time.

# Mysterium - Rules

## SETUP

One player chooses to be the **ghost** and the other
players are **psychics**. The ghost may choose to play
the game without uttering a single word; eg, he might
confirm the psychics’ intuitions by knocking on the
table: one knock for _yes_ , 2 knocks for _no_.

Each psychic takes 1 **intuition token** (crystal ball),
1 **sleeve** , 1 **clairvoyancy level marker** (place this
pointing to the 0 space on the clairvoyancy track), and
a number of **clairvoyancy tokens** depending on the
number of players:

**2-3 players:** 0
**4-5 players:** 4 (numbered from 1 to 4)
**6-7 players:** 6 (numbered from 1 to 6)

Place the **clock** on the table with the hour hand set to
I (the 1st hour). The space in front of the clock is the
clairvoyance token discard area.

Set up the **progress boards** as shown in the rules
(starting from the psychics’ end of the table: the
character, location, object, and epilogue boards).
Place the **clairvoyancy track** around the epilogue
progress board, with the side faceup that corresponds
to the number of players.

The ghost places the **screen** in front of him. Each
column corresponds to a different psychic, and each
row corresponds to a type of **ghost card** : **character** ,
**location** , and **object**.

Choose the game’s **difficulty level** :
**Permitted
Total ## discards by
Players: 2 3 4 5 6 7 the ghost**

**Easy:** 4 5 5 6 6 7 / turn

**Medium:** 5 6 6 7 8 8 / game

**Hard:** 6 7 7 8 9 9 / game

The ghost takes the number of **crow markers**
corresponding to the chosen difficulty level.

Shuffle the **character psychic cards** and draw
(facedown) the number shown above.

Look through the **character ghost cards** and select
the ones whose numbers match the drawn character
psychic cards; pass these to the ghost. Place the
character psychic cards faceup next to the character
progress board.

The ghost shuffles the received character ghost cards
and draws as many cards as there are psychics in the
game. He places these in the character spaces on the
inside of the screen, in the columns representing the
colours of the various psychics. Return any remaining
cards to the box without looking at them.

```
Repeat these steps for the location cards and then the
object cards , placing the drawn psychic cards next to
the appropriate progress boards, and the ghost cards in
the appropriate spaces on the inside of the screen. This
generates a combination of 3 cards (character, location
and object) for each psychic.
```
```
The ghost takes 6 culprit tokens , 3 crow markers ,
and the ghost tokens corresponding to the psychcs in
the game. Place the ghost tokens behind the screen,
coloured side up, at the bottom of the appropriate
columns.
Place the vision deck behind the screen. The ghost
starts the game by drawing a hand of 7 cards from the
vision deck.
```
## GAMEPLAY

## PHASE 1: RECONSTRUCTION OF EVENTS

```
The psychics attempt to identify, in order, which
characters are crime suspects, where the deed might
have been committed, and what objects might have
served as the murder weapon. Each psychic moves
their intuition token along the 4 progress boards to
visually represent their progress.
```
```
The phase takes place in 2 steps:
```
## Step 1: Vision Interpretation

```
At the start of the first turn, place the psychics’
intuition tokens on the character progress board.
```
```
The ghost’s task is now to help the psychics to guess
the character card assigned to them behind the screen.
He does this by projecting a vision to each psychic,
consisting of one or more vision cards.
To project a vision, the ghost:
```
**1. Chooses a psychic** and places 1 or more vision cards
    faceup in front of him;
**2. Pushes the ghost token** matching the psychic’s
    colour against the screen to remind the ghost that
    he has already given vision cards to that psychic and
    cannot give him any more cards in the current turn;
**3. Draws vision cards** to bring his hand up to 7 cards.
    If the vision cards draw pile is empty, shuffle it to
    create a new draw pile;
**4. Picks another psychic** and repeats the same
    procedure until all psychics have received at least
    one vision card.
Upon receiving a vision, each psychic attempts to
interpret it and discover the character/location/object
to which it refers (depending which progress board
their intuition token is currently on). Psychics may
freely examine their vision cards and psychic cards,
and discuss hypotheses with the other psychics.

```
When the ghost has projected visions to all psychics,
he starts the sand timer.
Before the sand timer runs out, each psychic must
place his intuition token on the psychic card to
which he believes the ghost is guiding him. The other
psychics may help with decision-making by analyzing
cards and giving their opinions. Psychics may change
the positions of their intuition tokens at any time until
the sand timer expires.
```
```
Several psychics may place their intuition token on
the same psychic card; however, as each psychic has
to find a unique combination (character, location and
object), at least one of those psychics must be wrong.
```
```
Although the ghost may listen to discussions between
psychics, he should never make comments or gestures
that could serve as clues.
```
```
Discarding vision cards
At any point in the game (including during the
Revealing the Culprit phase), the ghost may discard
any or all of his vision cards and draw new cards to
bring his hand to 7 cards (subject to the limit on
the number of discard operations determined by the
difficulty level).
Place a crow marker on the screen every time these
option is taken to keep track.
```
```
Using clairvoyancy tokens
At any time until the sand timer expires, players may
add or remove clairvoyancy tokens to the intuition
tokens played by the other psychic. These tokens
enable psychics to progress on the clairvoyancy track,
potentially unlocking extra clues when attempting to
identify the culprit in the final phase of the game.
There are 2 types of clairvoyancy tokens: tokens with
the icon, indicating that the player agrees with
the psychic’s intuition, and those with the icon,
indicating the opposite.
```
```
A psychic may not play more than 1 clairvoyancy token
per intuition token or add a clairvoyancy token to his
own intuition token.
```
```
A psychic may play as many clairvoyancy tokens as he
wants during a turn, but is not obliged to use any at all.
```
```
As multiple intuition tokens may be placed on the
same psychic card, each clairvoyancy token should
clearly point to the token with which it is associated.
After use, all clairvoyancy tokens must be discarded
to the space on the clock board, to be retrieved at the
start of the fourth game turn.
```
```
When the sand timer runs out, the Vision
Interpretation step ends.
```

## Step 2: Spectral Manifestation

The ghost manifests itself to let the psychics know
whether or not they have correctly interpreted their
visions. The ghost may reveal this information in any
order he pleases. He informs each psychic that his
intuition was correct (if the psychic’s token was placed
on the right card) or incorrect (if the token was not
placed on the correct card).

After manifesting to a psychic, the ghost moves the
ghost token of the corresponding colour away from the
screen.

**If the psychic picked the correct psychic card:**

The ghost flips the corresponding ghost card in the
screen. Any psychics who played a clairvoyancy
token move their markers forward 1 space on the
clairvoyancy track. The psychic collects the correct
psychic card and slides it into his sleeve, discards all
his vision cards, then takes his intuition token and
places it on the next progress board.

**If the psychic has not picked the correct psychic card:**
Any psychics who played a clairvoyancy token move
their marker forward 1 space on the clairvoyancy track.
The psychic returns his intuition token to the same
progress board from which it was taken, and retains
his vision cards in front of him. In each subsequent
turn, the ghost will provide 1 or more additional cards
to enhance the vision, until either the correct psychic
card is picked or the game ends.

**If a psychic has just obtained his 3 psychic cards:**

When a psychic has successfully identified his
combination of psychic cards, he places his intuition
token on the **mission accomplished** space on the
**epilogue progress board**.

**He then moves his marker forward 1 space on the
clairvoyancy track for each hour remaining on the
clock**.

Thereafter, he continues to take part by helping the
other psychics to interpret their visions, and may still
play any remaining clairvoyancy tokens.

```
At the end of this step, move the hour hand
forward 1 hour on the clock.
```
The psychics’ intuition tokens may be located on
different progress boards.

If one or more psychics have not yet identified their
character, location and object, a new _Reconstruction of
Events_ phase begins. If the clock was already showing
the VII (the 7th hour), the game ends and all players
lose.

If all the psychics have successfully identified their
character, location and object combinations, move on
to _Phase 2: Revealing the Culprit_.

## PHASE 2: REVEALING THE CULPRIT

```
This phase only takes place if all the psychics have
successfully identified their character, location and
object combinations before the clock strikes VIII.
```
## Step 1: Suspect Line-up

```
The psychics arrange their combinations of cards into
groups, in order to compare the suspects and enable
the ghost to identify the culprit.
```
```
Collect any psychic cards that were not placed in
sleeves and return them to the box, together with the
character, location and object progress boards.
```
```
The psychics collect all of their clairvoyancy tokens.
```
```
Place 1 ghost token per psychic in the centre of the
table, numbered side up. Return the unused ghost
tokens to the box.
```
```
The psychics remove their combinations of 3 cards
from their sleeves and associate them with the
numbered tokens, forming several groups of cards in
the center of the table, each containing 1 suspect.
```
## Step 2: Shared Vision

```
The ghost attempts to guide the psychics towards the
group of cards in the middle of the table that contains
the culprit.
The ghost picks 3 vision cards from his hand. These
cards form a shared vision and must all point to
the same group. One of the cards must point to the
character in the target group, another to the location ,
and one to the object. The ghost then shuffles the
shared vision cards and places them facedown in the
middle of the table. This is the culprit’s group.
```
```
The ghost secretly takes the culprit token with the
number matching that group and places it facedown in
the culprit space on the epilogue progress board.
```
## Step 3: Straw Poll

```
The psychics hold a majority vote to pick the group
containing the suspected culprit. The ghost must not
indicate which card in the shared vision relates to
which element of the combination.
```
```
The psychics vote in secret, and cannot communicate
with each other during the procedure. Psychics vote at
different times, depending on their clairvoyancy level ,
as determined by the position of their clairvoyancy level
marker on the clairvoyancy track.
```
```
Psychics with a low clairvoyancy level will see
only 1 card from the shared vision before voting
to identify the culprit’s group;
```
```
Psychics with an intermediate clairvoyancy level
will see 2 cards;
```
```
Psychics with an high clairvoyancy level will see
all 3 cards.
```
```
Psychics vote using the numbered sides of their
clairvoyancy tokens. Each psychic takes the token
bearing the number of the group that he thinks
contains the culprit and slides it into his sleeve.
```
```
When all psychics have voted, the votes are revealed.
```
```
Revealing the votes and the true culprit
Pass all the sleeves to the psychic with the highest
score on the clairvoyancy track (on a tie, to the
eldest of the tied players). This player reveals each
clairvoyancy token in turn, placing it on the card group
matching the number on the ghost token.
When all tokens have been placed:
```
```
If one of the groups has received more votes than the
others, it is the suspected culprit’s group.
```
```
If no single group has a clear majority, the tie is
broken in favor of the group chosen by the player
who progressed furthest along the clairvoyancy track.
That group is the suspected culprit’s group.
```
```
If a tie persists, it is broken in favour of the group for
which the eldest player voted.
```
```
Reveal the culprit token placed on the culprit space.
```
## END OF THE GAME

```
If the group chosen by the psychics contains the true
culprit, all players win the game together and the
ghost’s spirit is laid to rest. Otherwise, the game is lost.
```
## 2 AND 3 PLAYER GAME MODIFICATIONS

## Setup

1. The clairvoyancy track, the related markers and the
    clairvoyancy tokens are not used;
2. Each player plays with 2 psychics;
3. During the shared vision, the 3 vision cards are
    placed faceup.

## Phase 2: Revealing the culprit

```
Step 1: Suspect Line-up
2 players: Randomly create 2 additional groups of
cards (with a character, a location and an object in
each group) using psychic cards discarded during the
game, bringing the total number of groups to 4. Then
place the tokens numbered 1 to 4 by the 4 groups
thus formed.
```
```
3 player: Place the tokens numbered 1 to 4 by the 4
groups of cards.
```
```
Step 3: Straw Poll
2 players: The player who plays the 2 psychics uses
only one of his intuition tokens to designate the
suspected culprit’s group.
```
```
3 player: Psychics vote openly rather than in secret.
The 2 players with the role of psychics must agree
which group to identify as the suspected culprit’s group
and place their 2 intuition tokens on it.
```
