## Quick Start Rules Guide

1. Setup: 
   - Each player chooses an alien race and gets 20 ships, 5 planet discs, and 8 cards.
   - Place your 5 planets in front of you with 4 ships on each.
   - Put the warp (discard area) in the center.

2. On Your Turn:
   - You're the "offense". Draw a destiny card to see who you'll attack.
   - Point the hyperspace gate at one of their planets.

3. Attacking:
   - Put 1-4 of your ships on the hyperspace gate.
   - Ask other players to help you attack (they can send up to 4 ships).
   - The defending player can also ask for help.

4. Playing Cards:
   - You and the defender each choose a card from your hand and place it face down.
   - Flip the cards over at the same time.

5. Resolving the Attack:
   - If both cards are Attack cards: Add the number on your card to your total ships. Highest total wins!
   - If one player plays a Negotiate card: The Attack card automatically wins.
   - If both play Negotiate: You have 1 minute to make a deal (trade cards or colonies).

6. Outcome:
   - Winners put their ships on the planet.
   - Losers' ships go to the warp.
   - If you win, you can attack again (max 2 attacks per turn).

7. Winning the Game:
   - First to have 5 colonies on other players' planets wins!

Remember:
- Use your alien's special power - it's what makes you unique!
- If you run out of cards, discard and draw 8 new ones.
- You can only win by colonizing other players' planets, not your own; *so turtling is not advised!*

## Factions/Playable Characters or Roles
- Each alien race has a unique power that breaks the rules of the game in some way. For example:
  - The Parasite can ally even if not invited
  - The Virus multiplies its ships instead of adding them in combat
  - The Macron's ships are worth 4 each instead of 1
  - The Oracle can peek at their opponent's encounter card before playing their own

## Additional Notes
The game's balance comes from players naturally teaming up against whoever is in the lead. The alien powers can create wildly different game experiences, so it's important to discuss any unclear interactions before the game starts.

# Cosmic Encounters - Rules

[[Cosmic Encounters.pdf]]

1.   Choose Player Color
Each player chooses a player color and takes the colony marker, five planets, and 20 ships of that color

2.   Set Up Warp, Planets, Ships, and Colonies
Players place their planets in front of them, stacking four of their ships on each of their planets. Then, players place the warp in the center of the play area. Finally, players place their colony markers at “0” on the colony track. •   Four Planets Variant:  If players wish to play a shorter game of Cosmic Encounter, they play the game
following all the normal rules with the following exceptions: o Players each have four planets instead of five.
o Players start the game with 16 ships instead of 20, placing four ships on each planet. o The winner is the first player to establish four foreign colonies instead of five.
o Players lose their alien power when having fewer than two home colonies instead of three.

3.   Prepare Destiny Deck
Take the three destiny cards that correspond to the color that each player has chosen and shuffle them with the wild and special destiny cards to create the destiny deck. Any cards that correspond to a color that was not chosen are returned to the game box; they are not used during the game.
4.   Choose Aliens
Choose between two options below
•   Cosmic Combo Cards (Playing Base Game with 5 players or less) Shuffle the cosmic combo cards and reveal the top card of the deck. Then, gather the alien sheets and matching flare cards indicated for the appropriate number of players and deal one randomly to each player.
•   Flare Cards: Shuffle the flare cards and deal two facedown to each player. Each player takes the two alien sheets matching their flare cards, chooses one sheet to keep, and returns the other alien sheet to the game box. Then, all players reveal their chosen sheet simultaneously.
o Classic Filch Flare: An alternate flare card for the Filch alien is included in this game. This card contains the controversial version of the Filch flare card from the classic edition of Cosmic Encounter. Players can use the Filch flare of their choice.
o Classic Empath Flare (Cosmic Conflict *CC): An alternate flare card for the Empath alien is included in this game. Players can use the Empath flare of their choice.
o Classic Schizoid Flare (Cosmic Alliance *CA): An alternate flare card for the Schizoid alien is included in this game. Players can use the Schizoid flare of their choice.
o Alternate Timeline Aliens (Cosmic Odyssey *CO): During setup for a game in which a player selects an alternate timeline alien, the new flare for that alien is added to the deck instead of the original flare. During the game, if the player plays the original flare for the alien (for example, after drawing it from the unused flare deck or it being included as a random flare), it DOES NOT count as matching their alien they must resolve its wild defect, not its super effect.
List of Alternate Timeline Aliens

Brute (Cosmic Storm) Daredevil (Cosmic Dominion)
Demon (42nd anniversary edition or Promo) Grumpus (Cosmic Storm)
Locust (Cosmic Incursion)
Micron (replaces Macron from the base game)

Masochist (base game) Perfectionist (Cosmic Eons) Sadist (Cosmic Conflict) Schizoid (Cosmic Alliance) Void (base game)
Zombie (base Game)

Special Alien Tokens: There are some alien powers that require the use of specific tokens
•   Cosmic Tokens: Many alien powers require the use of cosmic tokens. For example, the Warrior’s alien power requires that tokens be placed on its alien sheet. Players use cosmic tokens when resolving powers such as these. Cosmic tokens have no inherent effects; they produce the effect described in the alien power.
•   Grudge Alien Tokens: Place the seven grudge tokens on top of the Grudge alien sheet.
•   Saboteur Alien Tokens (Cosmic Conflict *CC): These tokens are only used when a player is playing the Saboteur alien. Sixteen of the tokens are decoys, while eight of them are traps. Their use is completely explained on the Saboteur alien sheet.
•   Horde Alien Tokens (Cosmic Alliance *CA): Place the 38 horde tokens on the Horde alien sheet. They represent the extra horde ships created over the course of the game. Horde ships are not restricted by the components in this expansion. If the Horde requires additional tokens beyond those included with this expansion, use a readily available substitute such as a coin or cube.
•   Sloth Alien Token (Cosmic Storm *CS): This token is only used when playing with the Sloth alien. It marks which side the Sloth player has chosen during an encounter, before he commits his ships at the end of the planning phase
•   Swindler Alien Tokens (Cosmic Storm *CS): These tokens are only used when playing with the Swindler alien. Six of these tokens are blank and one is marked with an “X” on its front to indicate which player is the Swindler’s “mark.” Their use is completely described on the Swindler alien sheet.
•   Joker Alien Tokens (Cosmic Dominion *CD): Take the nine joker tokens (six different attacks, a regular negotiate, and a retreat) and place them faceup on their sheet.
•   Yin-Yang Alien Tokens (Cosmic Dominion *CD): Place two Yin-Yang tokens on their alien sheet.
•   Tourist Alien Cruise Line Token (Cosmic Dominion *CD): Take the cruise line token and place it in your home system (in front of your home planets)
•   Silencer Alien Tokens (Cosmic Odyssey *CO): Place 7 silence tokens on their alien sheet. •   Vector Alien Token (Cosmic Odyssey *CO): Place vector alien token on their alien sheet.

Special Alien Cards: There are some alien powers that require the use of specific cards
•   Invader Alien Destiny Cards (Cosmic Conflict *CC): There are three “Invasion!” destiny cards are only used when a player is playing the Invader alien. These cards should be shuffled into the destiny deck
•   Schizoid Alien Cards (Cosmic Alliance *CA): Place the six Schizoid Cards next to the alien sheet. To use the schizoid cards, players simply follow the instructions on the Schizoid alien sheet.
•   Alien Essence Cards (Cosmic Eons *CE): Several aliens begin the game with a new component called essence cards. Each of these aliens has an essence symbol on its sheet and its own set of essence cards which enhance its power Aliens with Essence Cards:


Alien Name Alien Anarchist Assistant Nanny Nightmare Oligarch Sheriff

Type of Essence Card Traumas Disruptions Helps Consequences Bad Dreams Privileges Tickets

Number of Cards 9 8 6 8 10 5 8


Before playing as an alien with essence cards, shuffle that alien’s essence cards and place them facedown as a set. Then, draw three cards from that set as your essence card cache.

Special Alien Cards (continued):
•   Alien Essence Cards (Cosmic Odyssey *CO): Several aliens begin the game with a new component called essence cards. Each of these aliens has an essence symbol on its sheet and its own set of essence cards which enhance its power Aliens with Essence Cards:


Alien Name Cosmos Negator Schizoid Witch Zilch

Type of Essence Card Rules Negations Conditions Curses Fates

Number of Cards 8 8 8 7 7

Before playing as an alien with essence cards, shuffle that alien’s essence cards and place them facedown as a set. Then, draw three cards from that set as your essence card cache.
5.   Prepare Cosmic Deck (flare, encounter, reinforcement, and artifact cards)
•   Collect the flare cards that were dealt to each player; if playing with fewer than five players or using the cosmic combo cards, add additional flares randomly to bring the total to 10.
•   Shuffle those 10 flares with the encounter, reinforcement, and artifact cards to create the cosmic deck.
•   Adding a Sixth Player (Cosmic Incursion *CI): When adding flares to the flare deck, simply add all twelve flares that were dealt out.
•   Adding a Seventh Player (Cosmic Conflict *CC): When adding flares to the flare deck, simply add all fourteen flares that were dealt out.
•   Adding an Eighth Player (Cosmic Alliance *CA): When adding flares to the flare deck, simply add all sixteen flares that were dealt out.
•   Large Group Cosmic Cards (Cosmic Alliance *CA): There is a set of 24 large group cosmic cards, marked with the large group symbol in both the upper-right and lower-left corners. Shuffle the large group cosmic cards into the cosmic deck when playing with seven or eight players. These cards may be used with fewer than seven players if the players desire more randomness from the cosmic deck.
5a. Prepare Reward Deck (Cosmic Incursion *CI, Reward Deck Variant)
In this variant, defensive allies may draw from a special, slightly more powerful deck of cards when receiving defender rewards. This variant makes use of the reward deck. Shuffle the reward deck and place it near the warp

Additional Reward Cards (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant)
If you have reward cards from both Cosmic Dominion and Cosmic Incursion, shuffle them together into a single 64-card reward deck, or use either deck by itself.

Ultra Reward Cards (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Ultra Reward Deck Variant)
This sub-variant adds a few even-stronger reward cards to the reward deck that have slightly different rules. Shuffle ultra reward deck into the reward deck. Continue shuffle until a normal reward card is on top.

5b. Prepare Hazard Deck (Cosmic Conflict *CC, Hazard Deck Variant)
In this variant, unusual conditions called hazards may come into play during certain encounters. Shuffle the hazard deck and place it near the warp.
Replace Destiny Cards (Cosmic Odyssey *CO) Replace Destiny Cards when using the hazard deck variant. Some other expansions add new colored components, including additional destiny cards, to accommodate additional players: orange (Cosmic Incursion), black (Cosmic Conflict), and white (Cosmic Alliance). For each color present in the destiny deck, replace the cards with glowing circle around the colored circle in the upper left and bottom right corner with its corresponding hazard destiny version. Reshuffle Destiny Deck.

6.   Deal Starting Hands: Deal a starting hand of eight cosmic cards to each player. Players may look at their cards but cannot show them to other players.
Inferno Alien Flare Cards (Cosmic Odyssey *CO): If Inferno Alien has been chosen by a player, add the additional five Inferno Flare Cards to the cosmic deck after hands are dealt.

6a. Space Station Markers and Cards (Cosmic Storm *CS, Space Station Variant): •   Shuffle the following 3 decks and deal one card from each deck to each player.
o Space Station Deck
o Sky City Deck (Cosmic Odyssey *CO)
o Deep Space Station Deck (Cosmic Odyssey *CO) •   Each player discards one of their cards.
•   Each player gains the markers that correspond to the cards they kept
•   Each player with a space station card attaches its markers to one of their planets by placing it against one of planets in their home system.
•   (Cosmic Odyssey *CO) - Each player with a sky city card attaches its marker by placing it on top of one of their planets in their home system
•   (Cosmic Odyssey *CO) - Each player with deep space station card places its matching deep station marker in front of their home system.
•   Return all unused space station cards, sky city cards, deep space station cards, and their corresponding markers to the box
7.   Choose First Player: If this is the players’ first game, the youngest player is the first player and takes the first turn when the game begins. Otherwise, use reveal cards from the destiny deck until a card matching the color of one of the players is revealed; that player is the first player. Then, shuffle the destiny deck

8.   Prepare Tech Deck (Technology Variant): Shuffle the tech cards and deal two cards from the deck to each player. Then, each player selects one technology card to keep and discards the other faceup in the tech discard pile. The tech that each player selects is placed face down in their play area.
•   Technology Rules with Four-Planet Variant: If players are using both the technology and four-planet variants during the same game, players must remove all tech from the tech deck that have a research number equal to or greater than eight. The removed tech cards are placed in the game box; they will not be used during the game
•   Technology Tokens: Place the Following Tech Tokens next to the Tech Deck: Genesis Planet, Lunar Cannon, and The Prometheus.
9.   Moon Cards and Tokens (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Moons Variant):
•   Sort the moon tokens by type and place them where players can reach them. •   Shuffle the moon card deck and deal each player three moon cards.
•   Each player chooses one to discard and then finds the moon tokens that correspond to their other two cards. •   Each player attaches each of their moons to different planets in their home system and places the matching
moon cards facedown in their play area.
•   A space station or sky city cannot be attached to a planet that has an attached moon

10. Lux Cards and Tokens (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Lux Variant): Create the lux deck by flipping all of the lux cards to their lux market sides and shuffling them. Deal each player two lux cards. After each player looks at the other side of their cards, they choose one of their cards and flip it over. Place the lux and ultra lux tokens in separate piles where players can reach them
Concepts	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:5

Alien Sheets
During the game, each player controls an alien that can alter the rules of the game. Each alien sheet includes the following:
•   Alien Power Summary: The top of each alien sheet features upside-down text that provides a one-line summary of that alien’s power for other players to read
•   Alert Lamps: Each alien sheet has a green-, yellow-, or red-colored alert lamp that indicates the complexity of each alien’s power. Green represents fewer complex aliens, yellow represents aliens with medium complexity, and red represents more complex aliens. The complexity of an alien’s power does not correlate to its strength; aliens with green alert lamps can be as powerful as aliens with red alert lamps.
•   Alien Name
•   Alien Power: Description of Alien’s unique power
•   Alien Prerequisites: The bottom of each alien sheet indicates the prerequisites for using that alien’s power. o Roles: The upper blue bar indicates which role the player must have to use that alien’s power (e.g., main
player, defensive ally, etc.).
o Mandatory or Optional Powers: The orange bar indicates if the power is mandatory or optional. If an alien power is mandatory, the player must use that alien’s power when they are able to. If an alien power is optional, the player can choose whether or not to use that alien’s power when they are able to.
o Phase Bar: The phase bar (lower blue bar) reminds players when the alien’s power can be used. One or more of the phases in this bar are highlighted in orange; the alien’s power can be used during these phases
•   Alien Power Precedence: If an alien power contradicts a rule from this booklet, the alien power takes precedence

Planets and Systems
Each player begins the game with five planets that match his or her player color. These planets are his or her home planets and compose his or her home system. Any planets that do not match the color of a player’s home planets are foreign planets to that player, and all foreign planets of one color are collectively a foreign system

Ships and Colonies
Each player has 20 ships that match his or her player color. Ships of the same color are stacked on planets. Each stack of one or more ships on a planet represents one colony.

If a player has a colony on one of their home planets, it is a home colony.

If a player has a colony on a foreign planet, it is a foreign colony.

Multiple players can have a colony on the same planet, but each player can only have one colony per planet

A player may only have one colony on any given planet, but a planet may have multiple colonies belonging to different players.

Bystanders
Foreign colonies on a planet where an encounter is occurring are bystanders. Ships that are part of a bystander colony do not contribute to encounters and are not affected by the outcome of an encounter. When committing ships, an ally can take any ships, including bystanders, from any of their home or foreign colonies.
Moving Ships
During the game, players move their ships to and from their colonies. When a player moves their ships, that player chooses which colonies they move from or return to, and these colonies can be home, foreign, or a mixture of the two. A player cannot return a ship to a planet where they do not already have a colony of at least one ship
Concepts	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:6

The Warp
The warp holds lost ships and tracks each player’s progress toward victory. When a ship is sent to the warp, it is placed on the warp where it remains until a player is able to retrieve it. The outer edge of the warp contains a track that indicates the number of foreign colonies each player has. Establishing foreign colonies is how players win the game

The Colony Track
The colony track always reflects the number of foreign colonies that each player has. If a player gains or loses a foreign colony, they increase or decrease their colony marker on the colony track accordingly so that the number their colony marker is aligned with equals the number of foreign colonies they currently have. When a player establishes their fifth foreign colony, they immediately win the game. If multiple people establish their fifth foreign colony at the same time, all players who have five foreign colonies win the game together

Losing Home Planets
•   When a player removes their last ship from one of their home planets, that planet is lost. •   Players cannot return ships to their lost planets.
•   Players defend their lost planets as normal but will not have ships to add to their total. •   Players can reestablish colonies on their lost planets
Losing Alien Powers
•   If a player ever has fewer than three (two for Four Planet Variant) home colonies, the player immediately loses his alien power and turns his alien sheet facedown.
•   Players cannot use the super ability on their alien matching flare card when they lose their alien power, but they can use the wild ability instead
•   If he draws his own color from the destiny deck (or a special card designating him as the defense), he may attempt to re-establish a colony in his home system.
•   If a player who lost their alien power ever has three (two for Four Planet Variant) or more home colonies again, they immediately regain their alien power, flipping their alien sheet faceup.

No Colonies during Regroup Phase
When a player would take a ship from the warp during their Regroup Phase, if they have no home or foreign colonies, they place the ship directly on the hyperspace gate and continue their turn as normal.

Re-Establishing a Home Colony
If a player draws a destiny card of their own color and has a home planet that has zero ships on it, they may aim the hyperspace gate at it to automatically re-establish a colony with up to four ships from their other colonies. This counts as a successful encounter, allowing the player to have a second encounter if this was their first encounter this turn.

Defending without Ships
If the defense has no ships on a planet during an encounter, they still play encounter cards, can receive help from allies, and defend their planet as normal. When determining totals, the defense’s own ship value is zero.

Color of Special Destiny Cards
For the purposes of game effects, a special destiny card is treated as a color card that matches the color of the player that the card indicates as the defense. Depleting the Destiny Deck If the destiny deck ever has only one card remaining, players cannot draw it. Instead, the remaining card is shuffled into the discard pile to form a new destiny deck.
Concepts	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:7

Drawing New Cards from Cosmic Deck
The different card types in the cosmic deck are attack, negotiate, morph, reinforcement, flare, and artifact.
•   When a player has no encounter cards remaining in their hand at certain times during the game, they must follow a special rule as follows:
1.   During the Start Turn Phase, if the offense has no encounter cards, they must discard their hand and create a new hand by drawing eight cards. They repeat this process until they have at least one encounter card.
2.   After a successful first encounter, if the offense has no encounter cards, they cannot have a second encounter that turn.
3.   During an encounter, at any time before cards are selected during the Planning Phase, if the offense has no encounter cards (due to an alien power or other game effect), their turn ends immediately. Any committed ships are returned to their players’ colonies.
4.   When the defense must play an encounter card and has no encounter cards in hand, they may play any cards in hand that can be played during the current phase as the defense. Then, they must discard their hand and draw eight new cards. This process is repeated until the defense has at least one encounter card.
•   Cosmic Quake: If a player needs to draw a card from the cosmic deck, and both the cosmic deck and discard piles are empty, then a cosmic quake occurs! All players discard their hands, the discard pile is shuffled to make a new deck, and eight cards are dealt to each player.

Winning the Game
Players win the game by establishing foreign colonies. The foreign colony track along the edge of the warp is used to indicate the number of foreign colonies each player has.
When a player establishes their fifth (fourth for Four Planet Variant) foreign colony, that player wins the game!

If two or more players establish their fifth (fourth for Four Planet Variant) foreign colony at the same time, all of those players win

Timing Conflicts
Players must resolve alien powers and card abilities according to the specific phases indicated on the component for that power or ability. However, there are times when multiple people may wish to resolve powers or abilities during the same phase. When this occurs, players resolve their powers or abilities in the following order:
1. Offense 2. Defense
3. Other players in clockwise order, starting with the player to the left of the offense
4. If there is no offense, start with the player who was most recently offense and proceed clockwise.

Zapping Alien Powers
•   Players can use the “Cosmic Zap” artifact card to cancel one use of an alien’s power. •   That power cannot be used again for the rest of the encounter.
•   Some alien powers (or some parts of aliens’ powers) do not require the power to be used. Powers such as these that function without being used cannot be the target of the “Cosmic Zap.”
o For example, the Warrior’s power can be zapped when used to add to the Warrior’s total during an encounter, but it cannot be zapped when adding tokens to its alien sheet. Similarly, the Zombie’s power can be zapped when used to save its own ships from going to the warp, but it cannot be zapped to stop the Zombie from freeing other players’ ships as part of a deal
•   Zap DOES NOT affect access to Space Station (Cosmic Storm *CS, Space Station Variant):  If a player’s alien power is zapped, lost, or affected in some way, he still has access to his space station ability as long as he has at least one ship on the planet attached to his space station.
Concepts	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:8

List of Schizoid Conditions (Cosmic Odyssey *CO)
While playing with the Schizoid, players can use this list of conditions for easy reference:



BLUFFER

COLONIZER

CONCILIATOR

INTRUDER

RELOCATOR

TRADITIONALIST


WANDERER


XENOPHOBE

After you fail to make a deal, if you have at least four foreign colonies, you win the game!
After you draw a new hand, if you have at least three foreign colonies, you win the game!
After you make a deal, if you have at least three foreign colonies, you win the game!
If three of your foreign colonies each have at least four ships, you win the game!
Relocator If you have at least three foreign colonies in the same system, you win the game!
If you have at least five foreign colonies and at least three home colonies, you win the game!
If you have colonies in at least three different systems and have three or fewer home colonies, you win the game!
After you re-establish a home colony, if you have at least two foreign colonies, you win the game!
Start Turn Phase	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:9

Playing the Game
To play a game of Cosmic Encounter, players take turns in clockwise order starting with the first player, who is determined during setup. During a player’s turn, they have an encounter. An encounter is an interaction between two or more players who are trying to either establish or defend a colony.

During an encounter, the player taking their turn is the offense.

The primary goal of the offense is to either establish a colony on a foreign planet or remove a foreign colony from one of their home planets.

The player who opposes the offense during an encounter is the defense.

The defense is determined by the destiny deck (Done during Destiny Phase).

The offense and defense are each referred to as a main player.

An encounter consists of the following eight phases that players resolve in order:


Start Turn Regroup Destiny

Launch


Alliance

Planning

Reveal

Resolution

The offense starts their turn
The offense retrieves 1 ship from the warp
The offense draws a destiny card to determine the defense and target system.
The offense aims the hyperspace gate at one of the defense’s colonies in the target system and places up to 4 ships in the gate
The offense invites allies, then the defense invites allies.
Starting to the left of the offense and continuing clockwise, allies join sides and send up to 4 ships each to help their side.
The offense and the defense each select an encounter card and play them facedown.
The offense and the defense turn their encounter cards faceup and add up their totals. Reinforcement cards can be played by the offense, defense, or any allies.
Players determine the winner of the encounter and resolve any effects from the encounter.


Start Turn Phase
The first player starts, then play continues clockwise.

Cards and Alien Powers that state "Start Turn" or “Any Phase” can take effect during this phase.

A player’s turn consists of 1 or 2 encounters: the first encounter is guaranteed, but the player has a second encounter only if he wins the first encounter (or successfully makes a deal).

The active player is called the offense and the player he encounters is called the defense.

If the offense does not have encounter cards, they must discard their hand and create a new hand by drawing eight cards from the Cosmic Deck. They repeat this process until they have at least one encounter card (Attack, Negotiate, and Morph are encounter cards).

If a player needs to draw a card from the cosmic deck, and both the cosmic deck draw and discard piles are empty, then a Cosmic Quake occurs! All players discard their hands, the discard pile is shuffled to make a new deck, and eight cards are dealt to each player.

Should the offense run out of encounter cards later on during the encounter, his turn ends.

Set Hazard Token to Yellow (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Hazard Deck Variant)
Phase 1: Regroup	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:10

During the Regroup Phase, the offense is able to research, complete, or abandon tech (Technology Variant) and also retrieve one ship back from the warp.
Cards and Alien Powers that state "Regroup" or “Any Phase” can take effect during this phase.

Intimidate Card – Any Player (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): Any player can play an Intimidate card face down on the table. Player must announce that it is an intimidate card. (Player can play one intimidate card per encounter). Non-Main players are advertising it for potential use by main players who might invite him or her to ally.
Rift Card (Cosmic Incursion *CI and Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): a player may play a rift to receive a benefit of ships, cards, or a colony as stated on the card.

Lux Market (Cosmic Odyssey *CO Lux Variant)
Offense makes a choice about who is able to spend Lux to purchase rewards.

Researching ~ Completing ~ Abandoning Tech (Technology Variant)
•   Researching Tech: To research a tech, a player takes one of their ships from among their colonies and places it on the facedown tech card. That ship must remain on that tech card until the tech is completed
•   Completing Tech: If the number of ships on a tech card is greater than or equal to the card’s research number, that player can complete the tech by flipping the card faceup and returning those ships to their colonies. The player can now use that tech card’s abilities as described on the card.
•   Abandoning Tech: A player can abandon a tech by revealing the card and placing it in the tech discard pile. Then, they return any ships that were on the card to their colonies

Retrieve Ship from Warp
The offense retrieves one of their ships from the warp and places it on any of their home or foreign colonies, stacking it on top of another one of their ships.
No Colonies during Regroup Phase
When a player would take a ship from the warp during their Regroup Phase, if they have no home or foreign colonies (no ships on any planets), they place the ship directly on the hyperspace gate and continue their turn as normal
Stripping a Planet of Ships
•   As soon as a player removes the last of his ships from any planet, he no longer has a colony there. Any ships involved in the encounter, or ships retrieved from the warp, cannot return to that planet.
•   If a player must relocate ships but has no colonies anywhere on the board, those ships go to the warp.
•   When 3 (2 for Four Planet Variant) or more of a player’s home colonies are eliminated, the player immediately loses his alien power and turns his alien sheet facedown. Players cannot use the super ability on their alien matching flare card, but they can use the wild ability instead.
•   Lose access to Space Station (Cosmic Storm *CS, Space Station Variant): If a player has no ships on the planet that is attached to his space station, he loses access to his space station ability and flips his corresponding space station card facedown.
•   Lose access to Deep Space Station (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Space Station Variant): If the owner of the system ever has fewer than four home colonies, that player loses access to the ability of their deep space station. Flip the corresponding space station card facedown.
•   Lose access to Sky City Ability (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Space Station Variant): If a player has no ships on a planet with a Sky City attached, that player loses the sky city ability
•   Moon becomes unoccupied (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Moon Variant): If a moon becomes unoccupied, its ability is no longer active.
Phase 2: Destiny	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:11

The offense draws the top card of the destiny deck and follows its instructions. The card determines which player the offense will have an encounter with. If there is only one card left in the deck, do not draw it; instead shuffle the final card and the discard pile together to form a new deck, and then draw.
Cards and Alien Powers that state "Destiny" or “Any Phase” can take effect during this phase.

Intimidate Card – Any Player (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): Any player can play an Intimidate card face down on the table. Player must announce that it is an intimidate card. (Player can play only one intimidate card per encounter). Non-Main players are advertising it for potential use by main players who might invite him or her to ally.

Hazard Deck (Cosmic Conflict *CC, Hazard Deck Variant): This variant uses the following rules: •   Hazard card is drawn if a player draws a destiny card with a hazard warning on it.
•   Set the Hazard Token to Red (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Hazard Deck Variant)
•   A hazard card is drawn before allies are invited, regardless of whether that destiny card is used or redrawn. Hazard warnings beyond the first drawn during the same encounter have no additional effect.
•   Hazard cards that are drawn take effect for the current encounter and, unless they are marked otherwise, are discarded to a hazard deck discard pile. Any abilities that affect discard piles do not affect this discard pile.
•   There are three types of hazard cards:
o TEMPORARY: Hazard cards not labeled are temporary. Its effect is resolved and discarded.
o SEMI-PERMANENT: This card remains in play until another Semi-Permanent card is placed in the play.
o ALT-HAZARD: Gives the offense an alternative option to having an encounter. If the offense chooses to use the alt-hazard effect, it ends that player’s encounter and provides a different effect for all other players.
•   Should the hazard deck run out, shuffle its discard pile to make a new hazard deck. I cannot cause a cosmic quake

If a Color is Drawn
•   If the card shows a player color, it indicates the planet system where the offense must have an encounter (and therefore which player is the defense).
•   If a player draws his own color, he may either draw again (until he draws a card of a different color) or attempt to drive a foreign colony off one of his home planets. The player whose owns the colony becomes the defense.
•   When drawing his own color, if a player has a home planet with no ships on it at all, then he may aim the gate at that planet to automatically re-establish a colony there with up to 4 ships from other colonies. This counts as a successful encounter.
If a Wild is Drawn
•   If the card is a wild, the offense may have an encounter with any player. The chosen player is the defense, and the encounter must take place in the chosen player’s home system.
If a Special is Drawn
•   If the card is a special, the defense for the encounter and where the encounter takes place is indicated. Specials are treated as though the card showed the color of the player designated as the defense.
Driving Out Foreign Colonies
•   If a player draws his own color from the destiny deck (or a special card that designates him as the defense), he may try to eliminate a foreign colony in his home system.
•   The offense points the gate at another player’s colony in his own planet system and chooses which player’s colony is the target, who becomes the defense for that encounter.
•   All ships of one color on any planet make up only one colony. All other colonies on the planet are bystanders.
•   If there is a planet in a player’s home system with no ships on it, aiming the gate at that planet allows the player to automatically reestablish a colony on that planet with up to 4 ships from any of his colonies. This counts as a successful encounter.
Phase 3: Launch	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:12

During the Launch Phase, the offense chooses the planet where the encounter occurs and commits their ships to the encounter.
Cards and Alien Powers that state "Launch" or “Any Phase” can take effect during this phase.

Intimidate Card – Any Player (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): Any player can play an Intimidate card face down on the table. Player must announce that it is an intimidate card. (Player can only play one intimidate card per encounter), Non-Main players are advertising it for potential use by main players who might invite him or her to ally.

The offense takes the hyperspace gate and points it at a planet in the system indicated by the destiny card-that planet is the target planet (Planets with fewer of that player’s ships are easier to defeat)

If the offense drew their own color destiny card, they may choose to point the hyperspace gate at a foreign colony on one of their own home planets, or they can discard the card and draw a new one.

After choosing a planet, the offense must decide how many of their ships to commit to the encounter. The offense must place one to four of their ships on the hyperspace gate—these ships are participating in the encounter.

Ships can be taken from home and foreign colonies and multiple ships can be taken from the same colony

Stripping a Planet of Ships
•   As soon as a player removes the last of his ships from any planet, he no longer has a colony there. Any ships involved in the encounter, or ships retrieved from the warp, cannot return to that planet.
•   If a player has no ships left on one of his home planets, he or she must still defend it (with 0 ships). If a player must relocate ships but has no colonies anywhere on the board, those ships go to the warp.
•   When 3 (2 for Four Planet Variant) or more of a player’s home colonies are eliminated, the player immediately loses his alien power and turns his alien sheet facedown. Players cannot use the super ability on their alien matching flare card, but they can use the wild ability instead.
•   Lose access to Space Station (Cosmic Storm *CS, Space Station Variant): If a player has no ships on the planet that is attached to his space station, he loses access to his space station ability and flips his corresponding space station card facedown.
•   Lose access to Deep Space Station (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Space Station Variant): If the owner of the system ever has fewer than four home colonies, that player loses access to the ability of their deep space station. Flip the corresponding space station card facedown.
•   Lose access to Sky City Ability (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Space Station Variant): If a player has no ships on a planet with a Sky City attached, that player loses the sky city ability
•   Moon becomes unoccupied (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Moon Variant): If a moon becomes unoccupied, its ability is no longer active.
Lux Variant (Cosmic Odyssey *CO): The offense takes four lux tokens and places a number of them near the targeted planet equal to the number of ships that they launched. Then, they place remaining lux tokens near the hyperspace gate.
Phase 4: Alliance	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:13

During the Alliance Phase, both the offense and the defense can form alliances with other players in an effort to sway the outcome of the encounter in their favor. Allies can be any player except the main players (Offense and Defense)

Cards and Alien Powers that state "Alliance" or “Any Phase” can take effect during this phase.

Intimidate Card – Any Player (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): Any player can play an Intimidate card face down on the table. Player must announce that it is an intimidate card. (Player can only play one intimidate card per encounter). Non-Main players are advertising it for potential use by main players who might invite him or her to ally.
First, the offense announces which players he wishes to have as allies (he may not invite the defense). These players should not respond yet.

Next, the defense invites allies, even those already invited by the offense (he may not invite the offense). These players also do not respond yet.
Bystanders: Foreign colonies on a planet where an encounter is occurring are bystanders. Ships that are part of a bystander colony do not contribute to encounters and are not affected by the outcome of an encounter. When committing ships, an ally can take any ships, including bystanders, from any of their home or foreign colonies.

Players only invited then choose sides. Starting with the player to the left of the offense and continuing clockwise, each player accepts or declines invitations. A player may only ally with either the offense or the defense side, or neither side

Stripping a Planet of Ships
•   As soon as a player removes the last of his ships from any planet, he no longer has a colony there. Any ships involved in the encounter, or ships retrieved from the warp, cannot return to that planet.
•   If a player has no ships left on one of his home planets, he or she must still defend it (with 0 ships). If a player must relocate ships but has no colonies anywhere on the board, those ships go to the warp.
•   When 3 (2 for Four Planet Variant) or more of a player’s home colonies are eliminated, the player immediately loses his alien power and turns his alien sheet facedown. Players cannot use the super ability on their alien matching flare card, but they can use the wild ability instead.
•   Lose access to Space Station (Cosmic Storm *CS, Space Station Variant): If a player has no ships on the planet that is attached to his space station, he loses access to his space station ability and flips his corresponding space station card facedown.
•   Lose access to Deep Space Station (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Space Station Variant): If the owner of the system ever has fewer than four home colonies, that player loses access to the ability of their deep space station. Flip the corresponding space station card facedown.
•   Lose access to Sky City Ability (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Space Station Variant): If a player has no ships on a planet with a Sky City attached, that player loses the sky city ability
•   Moon becomes unoccupied (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Moon Variant): If a moon becomes unoccupied, its ability is no longer active.

Only after a player has allied or declined, and committed ships, does the next player accept or decline an invitation.

When a player becomes an ally, they must commit one to four of their ships to the encounter. Similar to how the offense commits ships during the Launch Phase, an ally can take ships from any of their home or foreign colonies.

If a player allies with the offense (offensive ally), he places 1 to 4 of his ships in a stack on the hyperspace gate.

If a player allies with the defense (defensive ally), he places 1 to 4 of his ships next to the targeted planet.
Phase 4: Alliance	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:14

Hidden Alliances Variant (Cosmic Eons *CE): This variant is recommended for games with four or more players and allows all players’ decisions during the Alliance Phase to be revealed simultaneously, creating a more suspenseful situation with opportunities for persuasion, misdirection, and betrayal.
•   Each player who is eligible to become an ally picks up an alliance dial and rotates it to indicate both the side that he or she is joining and the number of ships he or she is committing, as follows:
o The number of dots in the window on the hyperspace gate end of the dial indicates the number of ships a player is committing to the offense.
o The number of dots in the window on the planet end of the dial indicates the number of ships a player is committing to the defense.
o A dash (–) in both windows indicates that a player is not committing ships to either side.
o A star is used to show special cases, as presented on individual alien sheets or cards (e.g.: using the Plasma Thrusters tech card).
o The rectangular card icon on the dial is used in the Foreign Aid Option
•   Foreign Aid Optional Rule This optional rule allows non-main players to send cards to main players as foreign aid using their alliance dials. Non-main players must position their dial even when they have not been invited to ally. Any non-main player, invited or not, may position his or her dial to show the miniature card for either the offense or the defense.
o Each player who is eligible to ally must rotate his or her dial to one of the positions listed above, even if he or she does not intend to join the encounter. This keeps decisions among all players’ secret.
o Players are allowed to make claims out loud about the positions of their dials, whether true or not
o In special circumstances where the alliance dial cannot show enough information to indicate a player’s intentions (e.g., when using the YinYang alien in Cosmic Dominion), the player dials the star into an appropriate window.
o After selecting positions on their dials, players place their dials face down in front of their alien sheets.
o After all of the dials are face down in front of alien sheets, but before they are revealed, the player with a special circumstance announces his or her choice out loud.
o When the dials of all eligible players are in front of their alien sheets, all of them are revealed simultaneously. o Those who have chosen to ally send their ships to the encounter according to the position of their dial.
•   Foreign Aid Optional Rule: When the dials are revealed, each player who chose to send foreign aid secretly offers one card from his or her hand to the chosen main player. The main players review their foreign aid offers and must accept or reject each one.
o If a card is rejected, it is returned to the offering player.
o If a card is accepted, the offering player immediately gets a reward
1.   Draw one card from the Cosmic Deck. 2.   Retrieve one ship from the Warp.
3.   Draw one card from the Reward Deck (If it is in use)
The main player may also invite the offering player to send a specified number of ships (subject to all applicable limits) to become his or her ally
Phase 5: Planning	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:15

During the planning phase, each main player will simultaneously select one encounter card from their hand and places it facedown in their play area.

Cards and Alien Powers that state "Planning" or “Any Phase” can take effect during this phase.

Intimidate Card – Main Players (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): When a main player plays an intimidate card (must be played before planning phase), it will automatically become his or her encounter card when cards are selected in the planning phase. (Because that main player has essentially “pre-played” an encounter card, he or she will not be subject to restrictions on card selection by game effects such as Loser, Magician, Oracle, Super Philanthropist, and Visionary, and does not have to draw a new hand or end his or her turn because of running out of encounter cards.)

Kicker Cards - (Cosmic Incursion *CI, Reward Deck Variant): The offense and defense can play a Kicker Card before encounter cards are selected. with the player announcing that he or she is playing a kicker. Kickers cannot be affected by game effects that target a player’s encounter card. A kicker’s effect depends on what encounter cards are played.

Type of Encounter Cards
The encounter cards that each player selects will be used to determine the outcome of the encounter. Encounter cards display the word “Encounter” at the top of the card.
•   Attack Cards
o Offense’s total is the value of the attack card plus number of ships they and their offensive allies committed o Defense’s total is the value of the attack card plus number of ships they and their defensive allies committed
•   Negative Attack Cards (Cosmic Incursion *CI, Reward Deck Variant)
o Some of the new attack cards introduced in the reward deck have a negative value (–01, –04, and –07). These cards should be treated as normal.
•   Negotiate: This card is used to negotiate a deal. Different rules apply depending what card it is played against. •   Morph Cards: Duplicates the other player’s encounter card.
•   Variable Attack Cards (Cosmic Dominion *CD)
o The larger number printed in black is the normal, standard value.
o If current encounter has a hazard warning in effect (that is, a destiny card was drawn that had a hazard warning on it), when a variable attack card is revealed its value is immediately transposed to become the smaller number printed in white.
o A variable attack card modifies itself before other game effects occur, and the modification is only for that encounter.

The offense and the defense now each select an encounter card from their hand (attack, negotiate, or morph) and place it face down in front of themselves.

Offense has no Encounter Cards
If the offense has no encounter cards in hand, their turn ends immediately
•   They return any of their ships that are on the hyperspace gate to all of their home or foreign colonies. •   Allies must also return all of their committed ships to their colonies as well.
Phase 5: Planning	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:16

Defense has no Encounter Cards
When the defense must play an encounter card and has no encounter cards in hand
•   They may play any cards in hand that can be played during the current phase (Planning Phase) as the defense. •   Then, they must discard their hand and draw eight new cards.
•   This process is repeated until the defense has at least one encounter card.
•   Cosmic Quake: If a player needs to draw a card from the cosmic deck, and both the cosmic deck and discard pile are empty, then a cosmic quake occurs! All players discard their hands, the discard pile is shuffled to make a new deck, and eight cards are dealt to each player.

Stripping a Planet of Ships
•   As soon as a player removes the last of his ships from any planet, he no longer has a colony there. Any ships involved in the encounter, or ships retrieved from the warp, cannot return to that planet.
•   If a player has no ships left on one of his home planets, he or she must still defend it (with 0 ships). If a player must relocate ships but has no colonies anywhere on the board, those ships go to the warp.
•   When 3 (2 for Four Planet Variant) or more of a player’s home colonies are eliminated, the player immediately loses his alien power and turns his alien sheet facedown. Players cannot use the super ability on their alien matching flare card, but they can use the wild ability.
•   Lose access to Space Station (Cosmic Storm *CS, Space Station Variant): If a player has no ships on the planet that is attached to his space station, he loses access to his space station ability and flips his corresponding space station card facedown.
•   Lose access to Deep Space Station (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Space Station Variant): If the owner of the system ever has fewer than four home colonies, that player loses access to the ability of their deep space station. Flip the corresponding space station card facedown.
•   Lose access to Sky City Ability (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Space Station Variant): If a player has no ships on a planet with a Sky City attached, that player loses the sky city ability
•   Moon becomes unoccupied (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Moon Variant): If a moon becomes unoccupied, its ability is no longer active.
Intimidate Card - Allies (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): When a non-main player has played an intimidate card (must be played before planning phase), he or she is advertising it for potential use by main players who might invite him or her to ally.
o After encounter cards are selected but before they are revealed, each main player may choose one intimidate card played by one of his or her allies to replace his or her encounter card (regardless of how that card was selected).
o This choice is made “blind,” without first seeing the intimidate card
o The ally can make statements (true or false) about the card but may not show it.
•   Intimidate cards on the table are not part of a player’s hand. Those that end up not being used, as well as encounter cards that get replaced by intimidate cards, are not revealed. Instead, they return to their owners’ hands as soon as it is clear that they are not being used
Phase 6: Reveal	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:17

During the Reveal Phase, both the offense and the defense reveal the encounter card they selected during the Planning Phase. Then, they determine the outcome of the encounter according to the cards revealed, as follows:

Cards and Alien Powers that state "Reveal" or “Any Phase” can take effect during this phase.

Main Players: The offense and defense simultaneously turn their cards faceup.

Variable Attack Card Rules (Cosmic Dominion *CD)
•   The larger number printed in black is the normal, standard value.
•   If current encounter has a hazard warning in effect (that is, a destiny card was drawn that had a hazard warning on it), when a variable attack card is revealed its value is immediately transposed to become the smaller number printed in white.
•   A variable attack card modifies itself before other game effects occur, and the modification is only for that encounter.
Kicker Card Rules (Cosmic Incursion *CI, Reward Deck Variant)
•   Attack vs. Attack: If both players play an attack, the kicker multiplies its player’s attack card by its value. For instance, a player with 12 ships on his or her side that has played an attack 10 and a x2 kicker has a total of 32 ((2 x 10) +12).
•   Attack vs. Negotiate: If the player with the kicker played an attack, the kicker has no effect. However, if the player with the kicker played a negotiate, his or her compensation is multiplied by the kicker’s value. For instance, a player who would normally receive 3 cards as compensation would receive 6 cards as compensation if he or she had played a x2 kicker.
•   Negotiate vs. Negotiate: In the event of a successful deal, a kicker has no effect. However, after a failed deal, the number of ships lost to the warp by the opposing player is multiplied by the kicker’s value. For instance, if a player played a x2 kicker before a failed deal, that player would lose the usual 3 ships to the warp, but his or her opponent would lose 6 ships to the warp!

If Either Player Reveals the Morph Card
•   The morph card becomes an exact duplicate of the opponent’s encounter card. Resolve the encounter normally as though both sides played the duplicated card. Once the encounter is resolved, the morph card returns to normal.
•   If both players in an encounter play a morph card, both sides lose and all ships in the encounter will go to the warp during the resolution phase.

If Both Players Reveal Attack Cards
•   The offense adds his card value to the number of his ships, plus any allied ships, on the gate.
•   The defense adds his card value to the number of his ships on the planet plus any allied ships next to it. •   The player with the higher total wins (ties go to the defense).
•   Reinforcement Cards (Main Players and Allies)
o The offense, defense, and any allies may play reinforcement cards on either side of the encounter.
o The reinforcement card adds to that side’s total. Players may continue playing reinforcements in response to other reinforcements until all players pass. Once all players have passed, the encounter is resolved with the new totals.

Retreat Card turns into a Negotiate Card (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): When a retreat card is played against anything other than an attack card the retreat card turns into a regular negotiate card, and both players attempt to deal. A retreat card modifies itself before other game effects occur.
Phase 6: Reveal	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:18

If One Player Reveals an Attack Card and the Other Reveals a Negotiate Card
•   The player who played the negotiate card automatically loses the encounter. He will get to claim compensation.

If Both Players Reveal Negotiate Cards
•   All allies on both sides return their ships to any of their colonies and get nothing. •   The main players have one minute to make a deal.
o A player may trade cards and/or allow his opponent to establish one colony on any one planet where he already has a colony. Any of a player’s ships that are not in the warp can be used to establish this colony. Cards must come from the players’ hands, not from the deck. Any ships remaining in the gate after the deal return to any of the offense’s colonies. Allies are never included in a deal.
o Trading Space Stations (Cosmic Storm *CS, Space Station Variant): Space stations (includes Sky Cities and Deep Space Stations: Cosmic Odyssey *CO) can be traded for as part of a deal, either in addition to cards and/or colonies, or by themselves. A player receiving a space station attaches the newly acquired space station to any planet in his home system which does not currently have an attached space station, sky city, or moon (Cosmic Odyssey *CO)
o Trading Lux Tokens (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Lux Variant). Lux tokens can be traded for as part of a deal, either in addition to cards and/or colonies/or Space Stations, or by themselves.
o Placing Ship on Moon (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Moon Variant): When making deals, if a player would gain a colony on a planet with an unoccupied moon, whether or not a ship can be sent to the moon must be a part of the terms of the deal.
o The players cannot agree to do nothing; a card or a base must change hands or colonies must be established for a deal to be successful.
Phase 7: Resolution	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:19

During the Resolution Phase, players resolve the encounter according to its outcome—an offense win, a defense win, a successful deal, or an unsuccessful deal. Then, all encounter cards played during the encounter are discarded.
Cards and Alien Powers that state "Resolution" or “Any Phase” can take effect during this phase.

If the Offense Won
•   All the ships on the hyperspace gate are placed on the planet.
•   Each player establishing a colony advances his player colony marker by 1 space around the warp. •   The defense’s ships on the planet plus any defensive allies’ ships go to the warp.
•   Other ships (Bystanders) on the planet do not go to the warp.
•   Retreat (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): If defense played a Retreat Card against an Attack Card, that player automatically loses the encounter, but the ships on their side live to fight another day.

If the Defense Won
•   Ships in already established colonies on the defending planet stay there. All the ships on the gate go to the warp. •   Defensive allies return their allying ships to any of their colonies. They also receive rewards. They can one of the
following for each ship they contributed to the defense: o Draw a card from the Cosmic Deck
o Draw a card from the Reward Deck (Cosmic Incursion *CI and Cosmic Dominion *CD Variant)
Limit of drawing one ultra reward card (Cosmic Odyssey *CO) - While a player is gaining rewards and draws cards from the reward deck, if they would draw two ultra reward cards, instead of drawing the second ultra reward card, they must gain the remaining rewards either in the form of drawing cards from the cosmic deck or freeing ships from the warp.
o Player can take 1 of his ships from the warp and place it on any of their colonies (Home or Foreign).
•   Retreat (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): If offense played a Retreat Card against an Attack Card, that player automatically loses the encounter, but the ships their side live to fight another day.

Placing Ship on an unoccupied moon (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Moon Variant)
When a main player wins an encounter on a planet with an attached moon, they may send one of their ships in the encounter to occupy that moon if there is not already a ship occupying it.

Successful Deal
•   The terms of the deal are carried out as agreed upon
•   The offense returns any of their ships on the hyperspace gate to their colonies (Home or Foreign).

Unsuccessful Deal
•   The main players (offense and defense) must place three of their ships in the warp. When placing ships in the warp, a player can take the ships from any of their colonies or from the hyperspace gate.
•   Crooked Deal Failed (Cosmic Incursion *CI, Reward Deck Variant)
o If a player fails to make a deal after playing a crooked deal, that player loses one less ship to the warp than normal, while his or her opponent loses one extra ship to the warp.
o If both players played crooked deals before failing to make a deal, the two crooked deals cancel each other out and both players lose 3 ships to the warp.
•   Negotiate (Faulty Translator: Cosmic Dominion *CD) and a Negotiate (Crooked Deal: Cosmic Incursion) are revealed in the same encounter, and the players fail to make a deal, both cards will take effect (causing one player to lose three ships and the other player to lose one).
•   Kicker Card (Cosmic Incursion *CI, Reward Deck Variant): The number of ships lost to the warp by the opposing player is multiplied by the kicker’s value. For instance, if a player played a x2 kicker before a failed deal, that player would lose the usual 3 ships to the warp, but his opponent would lose 6 ships to the warp!
•   The offense returns any of their ships on the hyperspace gate to their colonies (Home or Foreign).
Phase 7: Resolution	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:20

Compensation
•   When one player plays a negotiate and his opponent plays an attack card, the player who played the negotiate card gets to collect compensation.
•   He must randomly take one card for each ship he lost to the warp (not counting any allies’ ships) from his opponent’s hand. If the opponent doesn’t have enough cards to provide full compensation, take his entire hand of cards.
•   Crooked Deal (Cosmic Incursion *CI, Reward Deck Variant): When a player collects compensation after playing a crooked deal, he or she receives one extra card.
•   Rift Card Taken (Cosmic Incursion *CI and Cosmic Dominion *CD, Reward Deck Variant): If a Rift Card is taken from a player’s hand the rift detonates, causing the thieving player to lose a number of ships to the warp equal to the rift’s value. After detonating, a rift is discarded.
Collecting Lux (Cosmic Odyssey *CO)
•   The offense gains all of the Lux Tokens near the hyperspace gate and the system owner collects all of the tokens near the targeted planet. Note: Unless the offense is attacking their home system, the defense is the system owner.
Stripping a Planet of Ships
•   As soon as a player removes the last of his ships from any planet, he no longer has a colony there. Any ships involved in the encounter, or ships retrieved from the warp, cannot return to that planet.
•   If a player must relocate ships but has no colonies anywhere on the board, those ships go to the warp.
•   When 3 (2 for Four Planet Variant) or more of a player’s home colonies are eliminated, the player immediately loses his alien power and turns his alien sheet facedown. Players cannot use the super ability on their alien matching flare card, but they can use the wild ability instead.
•   Lose access to Space Station (Cosmic Storm *CS, Space Station Variant): If a player has no ships on the planet that is attached to his space station, he loses access to his space station ability and flips his corresponding space station card facedown.
•   Lose access to Deep Space Station (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Space Station Variant): If the owner of the system ever has fewer than four home colonies, that player loses access to the ability of their deep space station. Flip the corresponding space station card facedown.
•   Lose access to Sky City Ability (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Space Station Variant): If a player has no ships on a planet with a Sky City attached, that player loses the sky city ability.
•   Moon becomes unoccupied (Cosmic Odyssey *CO, Moon Variant): If a moon becomes unoccupied, its ability is no longer active.
After Resolving the Encounter
•   Discard the revealed encounter cards to the discard pile.
•   If the offense won the encounter (or successfully made a deal) and this was his first encounter, he may have a second encounter or choose to acquire new technology (Technology Variant)
•   If the defense won (or a deal failed), the offense may not have a second encounter; play passes clockwise

Acquiring New Tech (Technology Variant)
•   If the first encounter is successful for the offense, and they still have an encounter card in their hand, instead of having a second encounter, that player may draw a number of tech cards equal to his or her current foreign colonies plus one. Then, he or she selects one tech card to keep and discards the others. The selected tech card is placed facedown and can be researched as normal. There is no limit to the number of tech cards a player can have; however, a player can only research or complete one tech card during each Regroup Phase.
•   If there is only one card left in the deck, do not draw it; instead shuffle the final card and the discard pile together to form a new deck, and then draw.
•   Note: The Machine may give up their second or later encounter to acquire a new tech card, but doing so ends their turn, regardless of their alien power
Card Descriptions	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:21

Attack Cards (Cosmic Deck – Encounter Card)
•   Attack If both players reveal an attack card, they calculate their totals. The offense’s total is the value of their attack card plus the number of ships they and their offensive allies committed. The defense’s total is the value of their attack card plus the number of ships they and their defensive allies committed.
•   The winner of the encounter is the player with the highest total. If the players tie, the defense wins the encounter.

Alien Essence Cards
•   Several aliens begin the game with a new component called essence cards. Each of these aliens has an essence symbol on its sheet and its own set of essence cards which enhance its power Aliens with Essence Cards:
Cosmic Eons *CE	Cosmic Odyssey *CO

Alien Anarchist Assistant Nanny

9 traumas
8 disruptions 6 helps
8 consequences

Cosmos Negator Schizoid Witch

8 rules
8 negations 8 conditions 7 curses

Nightmare 10 bad dreams	Zilch	7 fates Oligarch	5 privileges
Sheriff	9 ticket
•   Playing with Alien Essence Cards
o Before playing as an alien with essence cards, shuffle that alien’s essence cards and place them facedown as a set. Then, draw three cards from that set as your essence card cache.
o When referred to by game effects, a set of essence cards is not considered to be a deck and a cache of essence cards is not considered to be a hand.
o Essence Cards in a player’s cache are kept separate from the set and kept secret from all other players until played.
o Players will always maintain a cache of three cards; each time players play or are forced to lose an essence card from their cache, they replace that card by taking the top card from their set and placing it in their cache.
o Any essence cards that are played or lost are kept in a faceup UNAVAILABLE PILE.
o When there are no essence cards left in a set, that player shuffles his unavailable essence cards to form a new set.
o When an alien sheet with the essence symbol is lost or flipped facedown, all essence cards still in the game belonging to that alien are returned to that player’s unavailable pile.
o Players can always look at their cache as well as essence cards they have played on another player. o Players who have been given essence cards may not look at them if they are facedown
Artifact Cards (Cosmic Deck)
•   Artifact cards provide players with powerful, single-use effects. When played, they produce the effect described on the card. Like alien sheets, these cards contain bars to indicate the requirements for playing the card.
•   Artifacts cards cannot be played as encounter cards but may be played at other times. They are discarded after use.

Flare Cards (Cosmic Deck)
•   Flares cannot be played as encounter cards but may be played at other times.
•   Flares are returned to the player’s hand after being played, but cannot be used more than once per encounter, and no more than one flare may be used per encounter.
•   Normally the wild flare effect on the card is used. However, if a player plays his alien’s own flare, the super flare effect on the card must be used.
•   When a player loses his power or has it zapped, he no longer has access to the super flare effect of his alien and may only use the wild flare effect on his flare until he or she regains access to the alien power.
Card Descriptions	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:22

Hazard Cards (Cosmic Conflict *CC)
In this variant, unusual conditions called hazards may come into play during certain encounters. •   Gameplay - This variant uses the following rules:
o Hazard card is drawn if a player draws a destiny card with a hazard warning on it. o Set the Hazard Token to Red (Cosmic Dominion *CD, Hazard Deck Variant)
o A hazard card is drawn before allies are invited, regardless of whether that destiny card is used or redrawn. Hazard warnings beyond the first drawn during the same encounter have no additional effect.
o Hazard cards that are drawn take effect for the current encounter and, unless they are marked otherwise, are discarded to a hazard deck discard pile. Any abilities that affect discard piles do not affect this discard pile.
o There are three types of hazard cards:
▪TEMPORARY: Hazard cards not labeled are temporary. Its effect is resolved and discarded.
▪SEMI-PERMANENT: This card remains in play until another Semi-Permanent card is placed in the play. ▪ALT-HAZARD: Gives the offense an alternative option to having an encounter. If the offense chooses to
use the alt-hazard effect, it ends that player’s encounter and provides a different effect for all other players. o Should the hazard deck run out, shuffle its discard pile to make a new hazard deck. I cannot cause a cosmic
quake

Morph Card (Cosmic Deck – Encounter Card)
The Morph Card duplicates the other player’s encounter card.
•   Morph Versus Other Card: If either player reveals a morph card, that card becomes a duplicate of the other revealed encounter card. If the other card is an attack card, players resolve the encounter as if two attack cards were revealed; if the other card is a negotiate, players resolve the encounter as if two negotiate cards were revealed. (Variant: Cosmic Incursion *CI) If both players in an encounter play a morph card, both sides lose and all ships in the encounter go to the warp.

Negotiate Cards (Cosmic Deck – Encounter Card)
These cards are used to negotiate a deal. Different rules apply depending what card it is played against.
o Attack Versus Negotiate: If one player reveals an attack card and the other player reveals a negotiate card, the player who reveals the attack card wins the encounter. However, the player who played the negotiate card collects compensation. Compensation is collected during the Resolution Phase.

o Negotiate Versus Negotiate: If both players reveal a negotiate card, all offensive and defensive allies return the ships they committed to their colonies. Then, the offense and defense must attempt diplomacy by making a deal. The main players may make a deal to trade cards and/or establish one colony as follows:

1.   Trade: A player can give any number of cards from their hand to the other player. Players can trade specific cards, specific types of cards, or cards at random. If players agree to a trade, they must trade the cards that were agreed upon (i.e., a player cannot agree to trade their highest-value attack card and then trade a different card). Players can discuss the cards they have, and a player can give cards without receiving any in return.
2.   Establish Colony: A player can choose any planet where he or she has a colony (home or foreign) and allow the other player to establish a colony on that planet. When establishing a colony in this way, a player can take any of their ships from the hyperspace gate or from their colonies.
o The offense and defense have one minute to make a successful deal. At minimum, a successful deal must result in either one card being traded, or one colony being established. If after one minute, the players cannot negotiate a deal, that deal is unsuccessful, and both players must send three of their own ships to the warp.
Card Descriptions	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:23

Reinforcement Cards (Cosmic Deck)
•   Reinforcements cannot be played as encounter cards. Instead, during the Reveal Phase, after encounter cards are revealed, the offense, defense, and any allies may play reinforcement cards on either side of the encounter.
•   The reinforcement card adds to that side’s total. Players may continue playing reinforcements in response to other reinforcements until all players pass. Once all players have passed, the encounter is resolved with the new totals.

Reward Cards (Cosmic Incursion *CI, Dominion *CD): In this variant, defensive allies may draw from a special, slightly more powerful deck of cards when receiving defender rewards. This variant makes use of the reward deck
•   Gameplay - This variant uses all of the standard rules and victory conditions, with the exception of the following rules.
o When a player receives cards as defender rewards, he or she may draw some or all of the cards from the reward deck.
o Discarded reward cards go to a special reward deck discard pile. Not all game effects that target the regular discard pile, or the cards in it, will apply to the reward deck discard pile. If an effect targets a card just before, while, or just after it is discarded (such as the Clone, the Fido, or the Vulch), then that effect does work on cards headed to either discard pile. However, something happening later that is not specifically responding to the discarding process (such as Delta Scanners or Space Junk) does not affect the reward deck discard pile; it is too late!
o When the reward deck runs out, shuffle its discard pile to make a new reward deck. If the reward deck discard pile is also empty, then no further reward cards can be drawn until at least one reward card is discarded. The reward deck never causes a cosmic quake.
o When selecting cards at random from a hand with both cosmic and reward cards, a player is allowed to choose which card backs he or she is targeting. In other words, “at random” means “without seeing the faces of the cards.
•   Reward Deck Contents
o Intimidate Cards - Intimidate cards are new non-encounter cards that often turn into encounter cards.
▪ During any encounter, each player in the game may play one intimidate card face down on the table, any time before the planning phase, announcing that it is an intimidate card.
▪ When a main player plays an intimidate card, it will automatically become his or her encounter card when cards are selected in the planning phase. (Because that main player has essentially “pre-played” an encounter card, he or she will not be subject to restrictions on card selection by game effects such as Loser, Magician, Oracle, Super Philanthropist, and Visionary, and does not have to draw a new hand or end his or her turn because of running out of encounter cards.)
▪ When a non-main player plays an intimidate card, he or she is advertising it for potential use by main players who might invite him or her to ally.
•   After encounter cards are selected but before they are revealed, each main player may choose one intimidate card played by one of his or her allies to replace his or her encounter card (regardless of how that card was selected).
•   This choice is made “blind,” without first seeing the intimidate card
•   The ally can make statements (true or false) about the card but may not show it.
•   When a player reveals an intimidate card as his or her encounter card, it becomes an attack card if the opposing player reveals an attack card.
•   If the opposing player reveals anything else, the intimidate becomes a negotiate card. An intimidate card modifies itself before other game effects occur.
•   Intimidate cards on the table are not part of a player’s hand. Those that end up not being used, as well as encounter cards that get replaced by intimidate cards, are not revealed. Instead, they return to their owners’ hands as soon as it is clear that they are not being used

Reward Cards (continued):
o Kicker Cards - The kickers in Cosmic Dominion work like those found in Cosmic Incursion, with the exception that each one also has game text giving it a unique twist.
▪ Kicker cards are played facedown during the planning phase before encounter cards are selected (limit one kicker per main player), with the player announcing that he or she is playing a kicker.
▪ They are revealed when encounter cards are revealed.
▪ Kickers are not affected by game effects that target a player’s encounter card. A kicker’s effect depends on what types of encounter cards are revealed during the encounter.
•   Attack: If a player reveals an attack card, its value is multiplied by his or her kicker. For instance, a player with 12 ships on his or her side that has revealed an attack 10 and a kicker x2 has a total of 32 ((2×10) +12). This takes effect after any self-modifying cards (such as morphs or intimidates) change their card types, but before other game effects.
•   Negotiate (vs. Attack): If a player reveals a negotiate card and collects compensation, it is multiplied by his or her kicker’s value. For instance, a player who would normally receive 3 cards as compensation would receive 6 cards as compensation if he or she had revealed a kicker x2.
•   Negotiate (vs. Negotiate): After a failed deal, the number of ships lost to the warp by the opposing player is multiplied by the kicker’s value. For instance, if a player revealed a kicker x2 before a failed deal, that player would lose the usual 3 ships to the warp, but his or her opponent would lose 6 ships to the warp!
•   The new kickers in Cosmic Dominion have additional effects depending upon their unique game text, but each kicker uses the multiplying rules listed above unless the card states otherwise.
o Negative Attack (Encounter Card) - Cards Some of the new attack cards introduced in the reward deck have a negative value (–01, –04, and –07). These cards should be treated as normal except that their value is less than zero.

o Negotiate Crooked Deals (Encounter Card) - The negotiate cards introduced in the reward deck still count as negotiate cards but are slightly better than normal negotiate cards.
▪ When a player collects compensation after playing a crooked deal, he or she receives one extra card.
▪ Additionally, if a player fails to make a deal after playing a crooked deal, that player loses one less ship to the warp than normal, while his or her opponent loses one extra ship to the warp.
▪ If both players played crooked deals before failing to make a deal, the two crooked deals cancel each other out and both players lose the usual number of ships to the warp.
o Retreat Cards (Encounter Card) - Retreat is a new type of encounter card that represents completely avoiding conflict. When a retreat and an attack card are revealed by opposing players, the retreating player automatically loses the encounter, but the ships on his or her side live to fight another day. When a retreat and anything else are revealed by opposing players, the retreat turns into a regular negotiate card, and both players attempt to deal. A retreat card modifies itself before other game effects occur.

o A Second Morph (Encounter Card) - A second morph card is included in the reward deck. It works exactly the same as the morph card from the cosmic deck. If both players in an encounter play a morph card, both sides lose and all ships in the encounter go to the warp.
o Rift Cards - The rift cards in Cosmic Dominion are similar to those found in Cosmic Incursion, but with a wider variety of uses. Rifts have two effects.
▪ First, a player may play a rift to receive a benefit of ships, cards, or a colony as stated on the card.
▪ Additionally, if a rift card is taken from a player’s hand and kept, either as compensation or as the result of another game effect, the rift detonates, causing the thieving player to lose ships, cards, or a colony as stated on the card. After detonating, a rift is discarded. According to Fantasy Flight Games' 2018 FAQ, a rift will not detonate if a player's card or power causes a player to give a rift to another player, because the rift is being "given" rather than "taken."
Card Descriptions	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:25

Reward Cards (continued):

o Variable Attack Cards (Encounter Card) - Each attack card in Cosmic Dominion has two different values. ▪ The larger number printed in black is the normal, standard value.
▪ However, during an encounter in which a hazard warning is in effect (that is, a destiny card was drawn that had a hazard warning on it), when a variable attack card is revealed, its value is immediately transposed to become the smaller number printed in white.
▪ A variable attack card modifies itself before other game effects occur, and the modification is only for that encounter.

o Unique Negotiate Cards (Encounter Card) - The negotiate cards introduced in the reward deck still count as negotiate cards but have unique game effects described on each card.
▪ Note: If a Negotiate (Faulty Translator) and a Negotiate (Crooked Deal) found in Cosmic Incursion are revealed in the same encounter, and the players fail to make a deal, both cards will take effect (causing one player to lose three ships and the other player to lose one).

o Other Reward Cards (Encounter Card) - In addition to the cards listed above, the reward deck depending on the expansion also includes a number of attack cards ranging from 10 to 23, new reinforcement cards ranging up to +6, several new artifact cards (including another cosmic zap and card zap), and additional morph. The morph card works the same as the morph cards in previous expansions: if both players in an encounter reveal a morph card at the same time, both sides lose. The Note, however, that only the cosmic deck contains attack cards higher than 23 and flare cards, so sometimes it’s better to draw from the cosmic deck, depending on what’s needed at the time

Tech Cards (Technology Variant): Tech cards represent revolutionary technologies that players can research. The text on each tech card describes the effect that each tech provides. Some techs provide players with single-use effects while other techs remain in play for the duration of the game.
•   Tech Cards is like alien sheets and artifact cards; the bottom of each tech card has bars that indicate the role the player must have when using the effect on the card as well as the phase during which the card can be used. After a player has completed a tech, they can use the tech by resolving the ability described on the card. The ability of some technology requires the use of specific tokens which are described on their corresponding tech cards
•   Special Tech Cards (Cosmic Odyssey *CO): Two additional types of tech cards
o Haz-Tech - These tech cards do not have a specific number of ships needed to complete them, but they have effects that scale based on the number on it. These techs cannot be completed; instead, they can be revealed when a hazard warning has been drawn during an encounter.
o Mili-Tech - These tech cards are not researched and are completed during a single regroup phase by the player discarding attack cards from their hand. There are three types of Mili-Techs:
▪ X=X   The player discards two attack cards with the same value (e.g. 08, 08).
▪ X+1	The player discards two attack cards with sequential values (e.g. 04, 05).
▪ ≥[#]   The player discards any number of attack cards whose values sum to equal to or greater than the number listed
Card Descriptions	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:26

Space Station Cards with Markers (Cosmic Storm *CS, Space Station Variant): In this variant, each player controls a space station that provides him with a special ability. Space stations can impact the game in a variety of different ways. Before starting the game, all players must agree to use this variant
•   Gameplay - This variant uses all of the standard rules and victory conditions, with the exception of the following rules.
o Each space station has a special ability that can impact the game as described on the space station’s corresponding card. Space station abilities are not considered alien powers. They are not affected by game effects that copy, steal, or cancel alien powers, such as Cosmic Zap.

o As long as a player maintains a colony on the planet with the attached space station (i.e., he has at least one ship of his color on that planet) the player receives the benefit or has access to the ability listed on his corresponding space station card. The planet to which a space station is attached does not have to be involved in an encounter in order for the player to use his space station’s ability.

o If a player has no ships on the planet that is attached to his space station, he loses access to his space station ability and flips his corresponding space station card facedown.

o If a player’s alien power is zapped, lost, or affected in some way, he still has access to his space station ability as long as he has at least one ship on the planet attached to his space station.

o If a planet with an attached space station is destroyed or otherwise removed from the game for any reason, the attached space station is also destroyed and removed from the game.

o Space stations can be traded for as part of a deal, either in addition to cards and/or colonies, or by themselves. A player receiving a space station attaches the newly acquired space station to any planet in his home system which does not currently have an attached space station

o If also using the Moons variant (Cosmic Odyssey *CO), a space station or sky city cannot be attached to a planet that has an attached moon.

Deep Space Station Cards and Markers (Cosmic Odyssey *CO): Rules for deep space stations: •   Only the owner of the system has access to the ability of a deep space station.
•   If the owner of the system ever has fewer than four home colonies, that player loses access to the ability of their deep space station. Flip the corresponding space station card facedown.

Sky Cities Cards and Markers (Cosmic Odyssey *CO): There is one rule unique to sky cities: •   Any player with a colony on the planet with a sky city attached has access to its ability.
Variant Summary	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:27

Single-Encounter Turns: In this variant, the offense is limited to a single encounter during their turn, even if they win the encounter or make a successful deal. This ensures that players take roughly the same number of turns throughout the game.

Four Planets: If players wish to play a shorter game of Cosmic Encounter, they play the game following all the normal rules with the following exceptions:
•   Players each have four planets instead of five.
•   Players start the game with 16 ships instead of 20, placing four ships on each planet. •   The winner is the first player to establish four foreign colonies instead of five.
•   Players lose their alien power when having fewer than two home colonies instead of three.
•   To experience a variety of aliens quickly, it is recommended that players play multiple three-player games using the Four Planets variant

Hidden Powers: In this variant, each player keeps their chosen alien secret until they are ready to use its power. During setup, the players do not reveal their chosen alien sheets to the other players—the sheets remain facedown, and their flare cards are shuffled into the cosmic deck without being revealed. While an alien sheet is facedown, its power cannot be used. A player may flip their alien sheet faceup at any time in order to use it. Once an alien sheet is flipped faceup, it remains faceup for the rest of the game.

Cosmic Combos and Flares: If players want to add flares to their game while still using cosmic combo cards, they simply create the cosmic deck with the flare cards matching the aliens on the cosmic combo card plus enough random flares to bring the total in the deck to 10

Rotating Powers: The offense draws a new alien sheet at the start of his turn and may then choose to keep it or the old sheet, discarding the other. If hidden powers are being used, new powers enter play facedown.

Freewheeling Flares: Players may use as many flares as they wish during each encounter, although each may still only be used once per encounter.

Technology: The technology variant allows players to use the effects of tech cards during the game. Tech cards represent revolutionary technologies that players can research. The text on each tech card describes the effect that each tech provides. Some techs provide players with single-use effects while other techs remain in play for the duration of the game.

Extremely Hazardous Variant (Cosmic Conflict *CC): For a wilder, more hazardous game, draw a hazard card for each encounter instead of only when a destiny card with a hazard warning is drawn

Hazard Sub-Variant; Procedural Change (Cosmic Odyssey *CO): This sub-variant changes the way that hazard cards are drawn. Instead of drawing a hazard card only when a destiny card with a hazard warning is drawn, a hazard card is drawn only if a player chooses to have a second encounter
Variant Summary	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:28

Team Cosmic Variant (Cosmic Alliance *CA): In this variant, players form teams of two and attempt to conquer the Cosmos together. This variant does not require any additional components, but it should not be played with fewer than five players. Note: It is possible to play the team cosmic variant with an odd number of players; one player does not have a partner. Setup Set up the Cosmic Encounter® game as normal, performing the following additional steps during Step 3.
•   3a. Take one destiny card of each player color and shuffle them.
•   3b. To form teams, deal out these destiny cards faceup into piles, two cards per pile (with one card remaining if there is an odd number of players). Each pile represents a team of two players who will attempt to win the game together. In a game with an odd number of players, one player (known as the “odd player”) does not have a partner and plays to win by him- or herself.
•   3c. After forming teams, partners sit across from each other at the table in order to spread out their turns as evenly as possible. If there is an odd player in the game, place an unused planet across the table from him or her.
•   3d. Take the destiny cards used to determine teams and shuffle them into the rest of the destiny deck.

Note: During Step 4 of setup, players cannot discuss with their partners which alien they are choosing to play.

Gameplay
This variant uses all of the standard rules and victory conditions, with the following exceptions:
•   A player cannot have an encounter against his or her partner. During the destiny phase, if a player draws a destiny card with his or her partner’s color, the player may either attack a foreign colony in his or her partner’s home system (as though the player drew his or her own color) or draw again.
•   The main players in each encounter always automatically invite their partners as allies. In an encounter against his or her partner, a player cannot ally against his or her partner. However, in an encounter against other players, partners can each ally with different sides.
•   If a player somehow gains a colony in his or her partner’s system, it counts as a home colony for that player, not a
foreign colony.
•   In order to win the game, each player on a team must either gain enough foreign colonies to win or complete an alternate victory condition. The game does not end until both players of a team have completed a victory condition. If multiple teams win at the same time, it is a shared win.
•   Each time a player gains a foreign colony, he or she may give his or her partner the foreign colony instead. The player returns his or her ships to his or her other colonies and allows his or her partner to place an equal number of ships on the planet instead. A player can have more than five colonies.
•   Players cannot show other players their cards (even their partners), but they may talk openly about their strategy and cards so that all players can hear – including mentioning specific cards in their hand.
•   Since the odd player does not have a partner, the odd player only needs to complete a victory condition by him-or herself to win. Also, the odd player receives twice as many turns as any other player. When the turn order arrives at the unused planet across from the odd player, he or she receives a full extra turn. Afterwards, turn order continues from the unused plan
Variant Summary	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:29

Space Stations Variants (Cosmic Storm *CS): Space stations can be incorporated into Cosmic Encounter® in a variety of ways. Below are two additional variants players may wish to try.
•   Multiple Space Stations: This variant provides players with multiple space stations and abilities. It can only be used when playing with five or fewer players.
o Setup: Deal each player two space station cards.
o Each player then takes the corresponding space station markers and attaches each of them to a different planet in his home system.
o Each player has access to the abilities on both of his space station cards as long as he has at least one ship on the planet with the corresponding space station.
o A player may lose access to one space station’s ability while maintaining the other, based on where that player has ships present.
o Aside from these distinctions, this variant follows all of the normal rules for space stations listed above.
•   Space Station Conquest: This variant allows players to acquire other players’ space stations for their own use. When a player wins an offensive encounter against a planet outside his home system which has a space station attached, that player conquers that space station.
o At the end of the resolution phase, the winning offensive player takes the space station card and its corresponding marker from the defending player.
o He then attaches the conquered space station to any planet in his home system which does not currently have an attached space station.
o In this variant, space stations may be traded as part of a deal as normal.
o A player has access to every space station ability he controls as long as he has a colony on the attached planet. o If a player acquires at least five space stations (four if playing with the Four Planets variant), that player wins
the game! This victory condition is only available if enough space stations are in play

Moons Variant (Cosmic Odyssey *CO) This variant uses the following rules:
•   Players can look at the effects of any moons in their system at any time.
•   When a main player wins an encounter on a planet with an attached moon,
o They may send one of their ships in the encounter to occupy that moon if there is not already a ship occupying it.
o Winning allies cannot send a ship to an attached moon.
o If the offense occupies the moon, they take the corresponding moon card from the system owner.
o When a moon is occupied, its card is revealed and the effect is resolved; some moons can be revealed later by the player occupying the moon, per the timing specified on the card.
•   If a player occupies a moon, they are treated as having a colony on the attached planet, even if that player has no ships on the attached planet.
•   Ships occupying moons can be used to defend the planet or be moved. If a moon becomes unoccupied, its ability is no longer active.
•   When making deals, if a player would gain a colony on a planet with an unoccupied moon, whether or not a ship can be sent to the moon must be a part of the terms of the deal.
•   If the attached planet is moved or destroyed, the moon and its corresponding card are removed from the game. Any ship on the moon moves to the planet if applicable, otherwise the ship goes to the warp.
•   Effects that specifically target ships on a planet do not affect a ship on the attached moon. Contents There are nine types of moons with each having a common mechanical theme. The new moon has unique rules.
•   New Moon Although each new moon has a common back, the effects on the other side belong to one of the other types. When a new moon is revealed, It is treated as the type of moon depicted on its other side. Therefore, a new moon that becomes a half moon is treated as a half-moon for other half-moon card abilities
Variant Summary	Cosmic Encounter Combined Rules (Version 8.3)	Page:30

Special Ships Variant (Cosmic Dominion *CD):
•   During game setup, if playing with special ships each player places his or her colored ship marker on one of his or her normal ships, faceup, to create a special ship. All players should agree on what the special ships represent, using one of the 3 variants listed below, along with the following general rules for special ships:
o Using your special ship’s game effects requires having control of that ship (not in the warp, not captured, etc.).
o If a variant provides a special action, the ship’s owner may activate this single-use effect by flipping the ship marker facedown. The owner may then “recharge” the special action for re-use by turning the marker faceup again whenever the special ship is retrieved from the warp, or if the owner does not have a second encounter on his or her turn.
o If a special ship is captured or removed from the game, when its owner retrieves a different ship from the warp during his or her own regroup phase, that player may place his or her ship marker on it, faceup, to create a replacement special ship.

•   When a main player or ally has his or her flagship in an encounter, after encounter cards are revealed he or she may add an extra +3 to his or her side’s total.
•   Hyperspace drive special action: A player’s flagship may interrupt play to move to one of his or her colonies, to one of his or her tech cards being researched, or into an encounter in which he or she is involved (ignoring hyperspace gate limits).

2.   Salvage Vessel Variant
•   When a main player or ally has his or her salvage vessel in an encounter, after winning the encounter he or she may either receive two rewards or draw two tech cards from the tech deck (if in use) and choose one to keep. This is in addition to any other benefits received for winning.
•   Tractor beam special action: A player’s salvage vessel may interrupt play to retrieve one card from the discard pile.

3.   Double Ship Variant
•   When playing with three or four players, each player may create a second special ship using a ship marker of an unused color. Players should agree on whether everyone will have two special ships of the same kind, or of two different kinds (agreeing also on which one is represented by the unused color). Normally a player may not send both of his or her special ships into an encounter, although game effects such as Amoeba’s power or a flagship’s hyperspace drive special action may allow it.

One-Off Games (Cosmic Odyssey *CO)
Players without enough time for a full campaign can still make use of the age cards to create a unique experience.
•   Before playing a one-off game, players have to agree whether or not they want to use scoring and then choose the
number of variants they would like to use.
•   Between one and three variants is recommended.
•   If players do not want to use scoring, remove the Forgotten Age of Eons card. •   If there are fewer than five players, remove the Dignified Age of Alliances card. •   Next, draw an age card and use its alien selection method.
•   Then, draw age cards equal to the chosen number of variants and combine all of the listed variants. •   If using scoring, use the last drawn card to determine the criteria for scoring.

Lux Variant (Cosmic Odyssey *CO)
This variant allows players to access fragments of stars that are gathered and transported by the hyperspace gate. This resource, treated as a currency and traded throughout the Cosmos, is known as Lux. This variant is a modified version of a variant originally introduced in a previous edition of the game. This variant uses the following rules:
•   During the launch phase, the offense takes four lux tokens and places a number of them near the targeted planet equal to the number of ships that they launched. Then, they place remaining lux tokens near the hyperspace gate. o For example: if the offense launches one ship, they place one lux token near the planet and three lux tokens
near the gate. If exactly three lux tokens would be placed on one side, those three tokens are replaced with one ultra lux token instead. After launching ships, if there are fewer than four lux tokens left in the supply, lux tokens are placed near the hyperspace gate first before placing any near the planet.
•   During the resolution phase, after any defender rewards are gained and compensation is collected, the offense gains all of the tokens near the hyperspace gate and the system owner collects all of the tokens near the targeted planet. Note: Unless the offense is attacking their home system, the defense is the system owner.
•   Lux and ultra lux tokens can be traded as part of a deal.
•   Lux and ultra lux tokens can be given to another player at any time in exchange for promises or favors, although these promises are not binding.
•   While each lux token is worth 1 Lux, ultra lux tokens are worth 3 Lux.
•   If a player is paying for an effect that costs less than 3 Lux, the difference is not recovered as lux tokens.
o For example, if paying for an effect that costs 2 Lux with an ultra lux token, the player does not gain one lux token. Ultra lux tokens cannot be exchanged for lux tokens otherwise
•   Contents
Each player has one card that is on the lux market side while the other card will be of a different type. Each of the lux market sides are the same while the other side is one of three different types which each share a mechanical theme.
•   Lux Market: During each player’s regroup phase, the offense makes a choice about who is able to spend Lux to purchase rewards. As presented in the base game, when a player gains a reward, they either draw one card from the cosmic deck or recover one ship from the warp. If also using the Reward Deck variant, the player can draw one reward card instead. As expressed in shorthand on the card, the three choices are as follows:
o 3 Lux: Only offense–If the offense chooses this, only the offense may spend Lux to receive rewards at a rate of 3 Lux per reward.
o 2 Lux: Offense and another player who agrees–If the offense chooses this, they also invite one other player. If that player accepts, the offense and this other player can receive rewards at a rate of 2 Lux per reward. Otherwise, the offense can choose another player or another option.
o 1 Lux: Everybody–If the offense chooses this, every player can receive rewards at a rate of 1 Lux per reward.
•   Re-Lux: Players can relax with Re-Lux, as each of these cards provides an additional way for its owner to gain additional lux tokens.
•   De-Lux: Players can impress with De-Lux, as each of these cards provide an additional way for all players to spend Lux to gain an ability. The card’s owner spends Lux for the ability while every other player has to pay the owner to use it. Other players do not need to ask permission to use the ability.
•   Ultra Lux: Players lucky enough to get an Ultra Lux card can spend ultra lux tokens to gain powerful abilities. The card’s owner cannot spend regular lux tokens to resolve the ability, they need to spend ultra lux tokens. (Remember, players can trade lux and ultra lux tokens with each other at any time.

Double Aliens - Rogue Variant (Cosmic Odyssey *CO)
This variant allows each player to use the powers of two aliens at the same time. •   Setup
- When used during a campaign, during alien selection, each player chooses two aliens from their coalition. - When used during a one-off game, resolve the alien selection method twice.
•   Gameplay: This variant uses the following rules:
o If a player does not control at least three of their home colonies, they flip both of their alien sheets facedown. o If multiple effects contradict each other or otherwise create a paradox—and therefore the timing rule is not
applicable—the player controlling the powers or effects decides which power or effect to use for the rest of the encounter.
▪For example, a player who has the Virus and the Anti-Matter aliens must decide which alien power is in effect during an encounter as a main player (since both powers replace the normal effect of the player’s ships)
o If no player controls an effect, that effect takes precedence over any player-controlled effects. If a resolution still cannot be determined, the effects are both canceled.
o As some alien combinations may create timing conflicts, it is recommended to review each player’s alien combination to preemptively identify any potential issues.

Hazard Aliens - Rogue Variant (Cosmic Odyssey *CO)
This is a sub-variant of the Double Aliens variant that interacts with the hazard warnings on destiny cards. •   Setup
o When using this sub-variant, each player chooses one alien to be active at the start of the game and flips the other facedown.
•   Gameplay
o When a hazard warning appears on a destiny card, players must switch to their other alien, by flipping both alien sheets.
o If multiple hazard warnings are drawn during the same encounter, only a single switch occurs.
o If a player has an alien whose power cannot be lost, it does not flip over, but their other alien still flips.

Hidden Options - Rogue Variant (Cosmic Odyssey *CO)
This is a sub-variant of the Double Aliens variant that adds a hidden element similar to the Hidden Aliens variant.
•   After aliens have been selected, they are not announced and placed facedown with their powers inactive. •   At any point, each player can decide to use one of their alien’s abilities by flipping its sheet faceup.
•   Even if an alien’s power is mandatory, the player can choose when to make that power active. •   After one alien has been flipped faceup, the other alien is removed from the game.
•   After the alien sheet has been flipped faceup it cannot be voluntarily flipped facedown.
•   If either alien has Game Setup text, that alien has to flip faceup during setup and the other is discarded.

Foreign Aid - Rogue Variant (Cosmic Odyssey *CO)
This variant allows allies to assist the main players in a more dramatic fashion.
•   When a player is invited to be an ally, that player may choose to send foreign aid rather than committing ships normally.
•   The potential ally offers the inviting main player a card from their hand.
•   If the main player accepts the card, the ally may send up to one ship into the encounter. •   If the card is rejected, the player may not be an ally for either side.
•   If there are more than four players and they have the alliance dials from Cosmic Eons, they should use the Hidden Alliances variant introduced in that expansion instead
