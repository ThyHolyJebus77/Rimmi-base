# Scythe

## Brief Summary
Scythe is a competitive strategy game set in an alternate-history 1920s Eastern Europe. Players control unique factions with asymmetric abilities, managing resources and workers to build an economic engine. The game combines area control, resource management, and combat as players expand their territories and complete objectives. Victory is achieved through efficient actions and strategic positioning rather than direct conflict.

## Factions/Civilizations
- Rusviet Union: Aggressive faction with the ability to repeat actions
- Crimean Khanate: Versatile faction with card-based benefits
- Nordic Kingdom: Amphibious faction with strong worker movement
- Saxony Empire: Combat-focused faction with extra objective options
- Polania Republic: Mobility-focused faction with encounter advantages

Each faction has unique mech abilities and a special power that significantly impacts their playstyle.

## Additional Notes
The combination of faction abilities and player mats creates high replayability. Expansions add new factions, airships, and resolution modules for even more variety.

# Scythe - Rules

#### SETUP

Shuffle the yellow combat cards and place them on their space on
the board. If the deck runs out, shuffle the discards to form a new
deck; no cards are drawn if both deck and discard pile are empty.

Shuffle the purple factory cards, randomly draw a number
of cards equal to the number of players + 1, and place these
facedown on their space on the board. Return the rest of the cards
to the box without looking at them.

Shuffle the green encounter cards and place them facedown on
their space on the board. Shuffle the beige objective cards and
place them facedown on their space on the board.

```
Place 1 encounter token on each territory on the board
marked with an encounter symbol.
```
Randomly select one of the structure bonus tiles and place it
faceup at the bottom of the popularity track.

Place the resource tokens (wood, oil, food, and metal), coins, and
multiplier tokens in a supply area near the board.

Each player randomly draws 1 faction mat and 1 player mat and
sits near their faction’s home base. The clockwise seating order
should be Nordic, Rusviet, Crimea, Saxony, Polania.

Your faction mat indicates:

Where you place your power token on the Power track;
How many combat cards you draw at the start of the game.

Put your 6 star tokens at the upper left of your faction mat near
the faction emblem; and your 4 mech miniatures on the 4 mech/
character abilities.

Your player mat indicates:

Where you place your popularity token on the board’s
Popularity track;

How many objective cards to draw at the start of the game;
How many coins you place on your faction mat. You never
have to reveal your total coin value to other players.

Place your action token next to your player mat. Put your 6
technology cubes on the green boxes with a black square in
the bottom right hand corner; your 4 structure tokens on their
corresponding boxes; your 4 recruit tokens (cylinders) on
the circular spaces on the bottom row; and 6 of your workers
(meeples) on the rectangles above the Produce action.

Each player takes a riverwalk card.

Place your character miniature on your faction’s home base.

Place 1 worker on each of the territories connected to your home
base by land. Your home base is not a territory.

The player with the lowest number in the label on their player mat
goes first; play proceeds clockwise.

#### GAMEPLAY

On your turn, do the following in order:

1. Place your action token on a different section of your player
    mat than where it was on your previous turn.
2. Take the top-row action on that section (optional).
3. Take the bottom-row action on that section (optional).

So you may take a single action, both actions (from top to bottom),
or neither action (still move your action token).

```
You may use resources gained from the top-row action to pay for
the bottom-row action.
```
```
You may also complete an objective card during your turn.
```
```
The costs (red boxes) and benefits (green boxes) on your player
mat are shown by the number of empty spaces before the action
is taken. When taking an action, first pay the cost, then gain
the benefit (or only part of the benefit, if you wish). You must be
able to pay the full cost to take the action. You may only spend
resources from territories you currently control.
```
```
After you’ve completed your turn, the next person in clockwise
order takes their turn.
```
#### TOP-ROW ACTIONS

## MOVE

```
Do one of the following:
```
```
Move: Move 1 different unit per (character, worker,
or mech) from one territory to an adjacent territory.
```
```
Gain coin: Gain $1 per.
Units may pick up and drop off any number of resource tokens
during a move action.
Mechs can transport any number of resource tokens and workers
(not your character); this does not count as movement for the
workers.
```
```
Units may not move across river or onto lakes unless they have
a special ability that allows them to do so. All territories with the
tunnel icon are considered adjacent to each other.
```
```
If your character or mech move into a territory controlled by an
opponent’s workers (and no other units), its movement ends
(even if a mech ability allows it to move further). Each of the
opponent’s workers on that territory immediately retreats to their
faction’s home base, leaving behind any resource tokens. You lose
1 popularity for each worker that was forced to retreat.
```
```
Your workers cannot move by themselves into territories controlled
by an opponent’s workers.
```
```
Any unit may move into a territory controlled only by a structure.
The player controlling the unit now controls the territory.
```
```
If your character and/or mech move into a territory controlled
by an opponent’s character and/or mech, their movement ends
(even if you have a mech ability that allows them to move further).
The opponent still temporarily controls that territory. If any of
your mechs or your character share a territory with an opponent’s
character or mechs, combat happens.
```
```
Your workers cannot move by themselves into or out of territories
controlled by an opponent’s characters and/or mechs.
```
```
You may not use a move action to move any unit from the board
into any home base (including yours).
```
```
If you move your character into a territory with an encounter
token, their movement ends and they cannot move again this turn.
After resolving all combats, if your character is still there, discard
the token and resolve the encounter.
```
```
There is no limit to the number of same-faction units that can be
in a territory.
```
## BOLSTER

```
Pay the $1 cost and gain one of the following:
```
```
Power:^ Increase your power on the power track by 1 per.
```
```
Combat card(s): Draw 1 combat card per.
```
## TRADE

```
Pay the $1 cost and gain one of the following:
```
(^) Resources: Gain any 2 resource tokens (any combination
(^) of wood, oil, food, and/or metal) and place them on any
territories you control with at least 1 worker on them. You
cannot do this if all your workers are on your home base.
Popularity: Increase your popularity on the popularity track
by 1 per.

## PRODUCE

```
Pay the cost (shown on all exposed red rectangles before taking
the action), choose up number of different territories you
control, and all workers on those territories may produce. Each
worker may produce 1 resource token: place the token on the
territory where it was produced.
If a worker produces another worker, after paying the cost, pick
up the leftmost worker of the produce action on your player mat
and place it on the village. Once you have a worker on the board it
cannot return to your player mat.
```
```
Terrain Produces Terrain Produces
Mountain Metal Village Worker
Farm Food Lake –
Tundra Oil Factory –
```
```
Forest Wood
Any number of resource tokens or workers can be on a territory,
and there is no limit to the number of resource tokens (if
necessary, place a multiplier token next to resource tokens).
```
#### BOTTOM-ROW ACTIONS

```
Most of the bottom-row actions give you at least 1 coin when you
pay to take that action. You may choose not to take the coins.
```
```
If you ‘complete’ a bottom-row action, you may continue to pay
the cost of the action to gain the coins (and the recruit bonus, if
applicable).
```
```
Each of the bottom-row actions has a recruit ongoing bonus
(green circle). If it is exposed, it rewards a player when they or
adjacent opponents take this action.
```
## UPGRADE

```
Pay the cost, take a technology cube from any green box on your
player mat, and place it on any empty red box with bracketed
borders. Red boxes with solid black borders are off limits for
upgrades.
```
## DEPLOY

```
Pay the cost, choose any mech on your faction mat, and place it
on any territory you control with at least 1 worker on it (not on a
lake, even if it has an ability that allows it to move onto lakes).
```
```
From now on, your characters and all mechs (not your workers)
gain the ability on the faction mat that was under the mech
miniature.
```
## BUILD

```
Pay the cost, take any structure from your player mat, and place it
on any territory you control with at least 1 worker on it.
```
```
Only 1 structure can be built on each territory. Opponents can’t
use your structure abilities; you always get the abilities even if you
don’t control the territories they are on.
```
```
A territory with one of your structures on it is under your control
even if you have no units there. If an opponent’s unit is on a
territory with your structure, they control that territory.
Structures cannot be destroyed or moved.
```
```
You may build on the factory territory. Your home base isn’t a
territory and you cannot build there. You can’t build structures
on lakes.
```
```
The benefit revealed by removing a structure from your player
mat is an additional benefit you will gain when taking the top-row
action directly above it in future.
```
```
Monument: Whenever you take the bolster action, also gain 1
popularity.
```
```
Mill: Whenever you take the produce action, the mill may produce
as if it were 1 worker. If there are workers on the mill’s territory,
they may also produce.
Mine: The mine acts as a tunnel that only you can use. You may
move units to and from your mine as if it was a tunnel (even if an
opponent controls the territory the mine is on). This is an ongoing
ability associated with all unit movement.
```
```
Armory: Whenever you take the trade action, also gain 1 power.
```
```
End-game bonus
At the end of the game, players gains coins for achieving the goals
shown on the structure bonus tile that was randomly selected
during setup. You gain the bonus even if you don’t control the
territories the structures are on.
```
## ENLIST

```
Pay the cost, take a recruit token from any section on your player
mat, place it on any open recruit one-time bonus space on your
faction mat, and immediately gain the depicted bonus. The token
remains there permanently.
The 4 one-time bonuses are: gain 2 power; gain 2 coins; gain 2
popularity; and draw 2 combat cards.
In addition to the one-time bonus, each recruit gives you a
recruit ongoing bonus related to the action from which you
selected the recruit token (the bonus in the circle).
```
```
For the rest of the game, whenever you or the player to your
immediate left or right (shown in the icon in the red circle) take the
bottom-row action in the section of the player mat from which the
recruit was taken, you gain the specified bonus. Top-row actions or
a similar action on a factory card do not count.
If more than one player would gain a recruit ongoing bonus, the
active player goes first, followed by the player on their left, then
the player on their right. If one of those players places their 6th
star as a result, the game immediately ends.
```
```
You must announce when you take bottom-row actions so
adjacent players know to check for recruit ongoing bonuses.
```
```
In a 2 player game, whenever your opponent takes an action that
would give you a recruit ongoing bonus, you only gain it once.
```
#### MECH ABILITIES

## RUSVIET

```
Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers onto
farms and villages.
```
```
Township: For the purposes of move actions for your character
and mechs, villages you control and the factory are considered to
be adjacent to each other.
```
```
People’s army: In combat where you have at least 1 worker, you
may play 1 additional combat card. You still require a character or
mech to participate in combat.
Speed: Your character and mechs may move 1 additional territory
per move action. If any of those units move onto a territory
containing an opponent’s character, mech, or worker, their
movement ends and they cannot move again this turn.
```
```
Moving from 1 tunnel to another still counts as 1 move, so with
this ability you could move an additional territory before or after
moving through a tunnel. Your mechs can pick up or drop off
resources and workers in the middle of a move action when they
have this ability.
```

## CRIMEA

Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers onto
farms and tundra.

Wayfare: Your character and mechs may move from a territory or
home base to any inactive faction’s (any faction not currently in
the game) home base or your own regardless of the distance.

Scout: Before you engage in combat, steal 1 of the opponent’s
combat cards at random and add it to your hand. You may do this
once per combat, not once per unit.

Speed: Your character and mechs may move 1 additional territory
per move action (see Rusviet listing for details).

## NORDIC

Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers onto
forests and mountains.

Seaworthy: Your character and mechs treat lakes the same as
other territories for movement: they can move to and from lakes
and retreat onto adjacent lakes (you may still also retreat those
units to your home base). If a mech transports workers onto a lake
(during a move action or when retreating) or if a character or mech
transports resources onto a lake, you may not leave those workers
or resources on the lake after moving off it, nor may a worker
move off the lake without the assistance of the mech. Lakes are
territories, so if 2 factions have a lake movement ability, combat
may happen on a lake. You cannot build a structure or deploy a
mech on a lake.

Artillery: Before you engage in combat, you may pay 1 power to
force the combating opponent to lose 2 power (adjust the power
track). You may do this once per combat, not once per unit.

Speed: Your character and mechs may move 1 additional territory
per move action (see Rusviet listing for details).

## POLANIA

Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers onto
villages and mountains.

Submerge: Your character and mechs can move to and from
lakes and move from any lake to another (like tunnels). If a
mech transports workers onto a lake or if a character or mech
transports resources onto a lake, you may not leave those workers
or resources on the lake after moving off it, nor may a worker
move off the lake without the assistance of the mech. Lakes
are territories, so if 2 factions have a lake movement ability, it’s
possible for combat to happen on a lake. You cannot build a
structure or deploy a mech on a lake.

Camaraderie: You do not lose popularity when, at any time on your
turn, your character or mechs force an opponent’s workers to
retreat after combat.

Speed: Your character and mechs may move 1 additional territory
per move action (see Rusviet listing for details).

## SAXONY

Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers onto
forests and mountains.

Underpass: For the purposes of move actions for your character
and mechs, mountains you control and all tunnels (including your
mine if you have one) are considered adjacent to each other.

Disarm: Before you engage in combat on a territory with a tunnel,
the combating opponent loses 2 power. This loss of power is
reflected on the power track. You may do this once per combat,
not once per unit.

Speed: Your character and mechs may move 1 additional territory
per move action (see Rusviet listing for details).

#### FACTION ABILITIES

## RUSVIET

```
Relentless: You may choose the same section on your player mat
as the previous turn(s). This also applies to a factory card if you
have one.
```
## CRIMEA

```
Coercion: Once per turn, you may spend 1 combat card as if it
were any 1 resource token. Combat cards are still worth nothing at
the end of the game.
```
## NORDIC

```
Swim: Your workers (only) may move across rivers.
```
## POLANIA

```
Meander: Pick up to 2 options per encounter card. The benefit
from the 1st selected option may be used to pay the cost for the
2nd selected option. Only 1 encounter card is drawn.
```
## SAXONY

```
Dominate: There is no limit to the number of stars you can place
from completing objectives or winning combat. You may complete
both of your objective cards (you don’t discard the second card
after achieving the first), and you are not limited to 2 combat
victory stars.
```
#### COMBAT

```
If, at the end of your move action (after all units have moved
but before you take a bottom-row action), if your character and/
or mechs share a territory with an opponent’s character and/or
mechs, combat occurs.
If this happens on multiple territories, the active player chooses
the order in which combats are resolved.
If the attacking player has a mech ability that impacts combat,
they use that ability first, followed by the defending player.
Lake battles can happen between mechs with the appropriate
abilities: if a mech transporting workers is on a lake and the
attacker wins combat, the attacking player loses 1 popularity for
each of those workers (they are forced to retreat with the mech to
their home base).
```
```
Select power
Simultaneously and secretly select a number on your power
dial (align the number with the icon at the top right). You cannot
choose a number higher than the amount of power you currently
have on the power track.
For each of your units (character and/or mechs) involved in the
combat, you may tuck 1 combat card from your hand behind the
power dial (even if you select 0 power).
```
```
Reveal
Both players reveal their power dials and selected combat cards
simultaneously. The value from combat cards is a bonus to the
power you are spending, as indicated on your dial.
```
```
The player with highest total power wins the combat (attacker wins
ties). Both players then pay the amount of power they selected on
their dial and discard any combat cards they used faceup.
```
```
The winner gains (or maintains) control of the territory and all
resource tokens on it, and places 1 star in the combat space of the
triumph track (if they haven’t already placed 2 stars for combat
victories).
```
```
If the winner was the attacker, they lose 1 popularity for each
worker they forced to retreat by initiating and winning combat.
```
```
If there was an encounter token on the territory and the winner
has a character there, discard the token and resolve the encounter.
```
```
The loser must retreat all of their units (mechs, characters, and
workers) from the territory to their home base (the units are
picked up and placed on the home base).
All resources those units were carrying remain on the territory and
are now under the control of the winner.
If the loser revealed at least 1 power on the dial or through
combat cards, they gain 1 Combat card as they retreat.
```
```
Stars
Each player (with the exception of the Saxon player) may gain a
maximum of 2 stars for winning combat; but they may engage in
future combats after they’ve achieved those stars. If your 6th star
is placed but you still have a combat remaining on your turn, the
game ends and any units you moved to initiate that combat move
back to the territory from whence they came.
```
#### ENCOUNTERS

```
When you move your character into a territory with an encounter
token, their movement ends and they cannot move again this
turn. After resolving all combats (but before you take a bottom-
row action), if your character is still there, discard the token and
resolve the encounter.
```
```
Read the text out loud, then choose one of the options and pay
any applicable cost. You must be able to pay any required costs,
but you may gain as much of the benefit as you’d like. Then
discard the card facedown to the bottom of the encounter deck.
Any resources, structures, mechs, or workers you gain go on the
same territory as your character.
```
```
If a card instructs you to gain something or perform an action, do
not pay any additional costs or gain additional benefits beyond
those on the card, or trigger any recruit ongoing bonuses.
```
#### THE FACTORY

```
When your move action is finished, after combat if necessary, if
your character is on the factory for the first time this game, look
through the factory cards on the board and choose one.
```
```
A factory card is placed next to your player mat and is treated as
a 5th section. Even if the card does something similar to a section
on your player mat, they are independent of one another.
```
```
All factory cards have a bottom-row move action that allows you to
move 1 unit up to 2 times within the same move action. All other
normal rules for movement apply. If you have a mine, you may
move through the mine with this move action. If you’ve unlocked
the Speed mech ability, one of your mechs or your character may
move up to 3 territories with this action.
```
```
You may have 1 factory card at most; your selection is permanent.
```
#### OBJECTIVES

```
You may reveal a completed objective card during your own turn
before or after you complete a top or bottom row action. If you do,
place 1 star token on the objective space of the triumph track and
discard the card along with your other objective to the bottom of
the objective deck.
Each player (with the exception of the Saxon player) may gain a
maximum of 1 star for completing objectives.
You may wait to reveal your completed objective, but you must
meet its requirements at the time you reveal it.
```
#### ALLIANCES AND BRIBES

```
Players may make informal agreements. The only tangible objects
that may be exchanged are coins (in tournament play, coins may
not be exchanged for deals or alliances).
You can’t negotiate your way out of a combat that has already
begun. Agreements made between players are not enforceable.
```
#### PLACING STARS

```
When you achieve one of the goals on the triumph track, you must
place a star on the appropriate space. You cannot lose a star after
you’ve placed it.
```
```
Normally, each player may complete each of these goals one time.
Having a star on a goal does not prevent other players from having
a star on that goal. You can’t place more than 6 stars.
```
#### GAME END AND SCORING

```
The game immediately ends when a player places their 6th star
token.
```
```
If the 6th star comes from taking a bottom-row action, gain the
primary benefit, the coins, and the recruit ongoing benefit before
placing the star.
```
```
If you have units (characters, mechs, and/or workers) remaining
on a territory with an opponent’s units (from a move action), you
must undo that portion of your move action, returning the unit(s)
to the territory they moved from.
```
```
If you place a star for total popularity or total power as a recruit
bonus on an opponent’s turn, that placement happens after the
opponent takes the action in clockwise order and only if that
opponent didn’t place their 6th star by taking that action.
```
```
End-game scoring
Total the coins you had before the game end was triggered, plus
end-game coins, to determine the winner. To determine how many
coins you earn for each of the 3 scoring categories, look at your
level on the popularity track and pick up coins for that category.
```
```
Delay of game (variant)
If a player delays the game (while it is being played) for more
than 10 seconds by trying to calculate the final score, they lose 1
popularity.
```
```
Scoring categories
Coins you accumulated during the game count for end-game
scoring.
```
```
Gain coins for every star token you placed during the game.
```
```
Gain coins for every territory you control (including lakes). Home
bases are not territories. You control each territory where you have
a worker, mech or character, or where you have a structure (but
no enemy units).
At the end of the game, the factory is counted as 3 territories to
the player who controls it.
Gain coins for every 2 resource tokens you control. Workers are
not resources. You control all resources on territories where you
have a character, worker, mech, or a structure not occupied by an
opponent’s unit.
```
```
Gain coins based on the number of structure bonuses you
received. You gain this bonus even if you don’t control the
territories your structures are on.
```
```
Declaring the winner
The player with the most coins wins. On a tie, use these
tiebreakers (in order):
```
1. Number of workers, mechs, and structures
2. Power
3. Popularity
4. Number of resource tokens controlled
5. Number of territories controlled
6. Number of star tokens placed on board

```
The winner of the game may write their name up to 2 times on the
achievement sheet. This commemorates the first time any player
wins under a certain condition.
```

#### GAMEPLAY

On your turn, do the following in order:

1. Place your action token on a different section of your player
    mat than where it was on your previous turn.
2. Take the top-row action on that section (optional).
3. Take the bottom-row action on that section (optional).

You may also complete an objective card during your turn before
or after you complete a top or bottom row action.

#### TOP-ROW ACTIONS

## MOVE

Do one of the following:

```
Move: Move 1 different unit per (character, worker,
or mech) from one territory to an adjacent territory.
```
```
Gain coin: Gain $1 per.
```
Units may pick up and drop off any number of resource tokens
during a move action. Mechs can transport any number of
resource tokens and workers.

Units may not move across river or onto lakes unless they have
the appropriate special ability. All territories with the tunnel
icon are considered adjacent to each other.

If your character and/or mech move into a territory controlled
by an opponent’s workers (and no other units), its movement
ends. Each of your opponent’s workers on that territory then
immediately retreats to their home base, leaving behind any
resource tokens. You lose 1 popularity for each worker that was
forced to retreat.

Workers cannot move by themselves into territories controlled
by an opponent’s workers.

Any unit may move into a territory controlled only by a structure.
The unit’s player now controls the territory.

If your character and/or mech move into a territory controlled
by an opponent’s character and/or mech, their movement ends
and combat happens.

Workers cannot move by themselves into or out of territories
controlled by an opponent’s characters and/or mechs.

You may not use a move action to move any unit from the board
into any home base (including yours).

If you move your character into a territory with an encounter
token, their movement ends and they cannot move again this
turn. After resolving all combats, if your character is still there,
discard the token and resolve the encounter.

There is no limit to the number of same-faction units that can
be in a territory.

the appropriate special ability. All territories with the tunnel
icon are considered adjacent to each other.
```
```
If your character and/or mech move into a territory controlled
by an opponent’s workers (and no other units), its movement
ends. Each of your opponent’s workers on that territory then
immediately retreats to their home base, leaving behind any
resource tokens. You lose 1 popularity for each worker that was
forced to retreat.
```
```
Workers cannot move by themselves into territories controlled
by an opponent’s workers.
```
```

by an opponent’s character and/or mech, their movement ends
and combat happens.
```
```
Workers cannot move by themselves into or out of territories
controlled by an opponent’s characters and/or mechs.
```
```
You may not use a move action to move any unit from the board
into any home base (including yours).

#### MECH ABILITIES

## RUSVIET

```
Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto farms and villages.
Township: For the purposes of move actions for your character
and mechs, villages you control and the factory are considered
to be adjacent to each other.
People’s army: In combat where you have at least 1 worker, you
may play 1 additional combat card. You still require a character
or mech to participate in combat.
Speed: Your character and mechs may move 1 additional
territory per move action. If any of those units move onto a
territory containing an opponent’s character, mech, or worker,
their movement ends and they cannot move again this turn.
Moving from 1 tunnel to another still counts as 1 move, so with
this ability you could move an additional territory before or after
moving through a tunnel. Your mechs can pick up or drop off
resources and workers in the middle of a move action.
```
## CRIMEA

```
Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto farms and tundra.
Wayfare: Your character and mechs may move from a territory or
home base to any inactive faction’s (any faction not currently in
the game) home base or your own regardless of the distance.
Scout: Before you engage in combat, steal 1 of the opponent’s
combat cards at random and add it to your hand. You may do
this once per combat, not once per unit.
Speed: (see Rusviet listing for details).
```
## NORDIC

```
Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto forests and mountains.
Seaworthy: Your character and mechs treat lakes the same
as other territories for movement: they can move to and from
lakes and retreat onto adjacent lakes (you may still also retreat
those units to your home base). If a mech transports workers
onto a lake (during a move action or when retreating) or if a
character or mech transports resources onto a lake, you may
not leave those workers or resources on the lake after moving
off it, nor may a worker move off the lake without the assistance
of the mech. Lakes are territories, so if 2 factions have a lake
movement ability, combat may happen on a lake. You cannot
build a structure or deploy a mech on a lake.
Artillery: Before you engage in combat, you may pay 1 power to
force the combating opponent to lose 2 power (adjust the power
track). You may do this once per combat, not once per unit.
Speed: (see Rusviet listing for details).
```
## POLANIA

```
Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto villages and mountains.
Submerge: Your character and mechs can move to and from
lakes and move from any lake to another (like tunnels). If a
mech transports workers onto a lake or if a character or mech
transports resources onto a lake, you may not leave those
workers or resources on the lake after moving off it, nor may a
worker move off the lake without the assistance of the mech.
Lakes are territories, so if 2 factions have a lake movement
ability, it’s possible for combat to happen on a lake. You cannot
build a structure or deploy a mech on a lake.
Camaraderie: You do not lose popularity when, at any time on
your turn, your character or mechs force an opponent’s workers
to retreat after combat.
Speed: (see Rusviet listing for details).
```
## SAXONY

```
Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto forests and mountains.
```
```
Underpass: For the purposes of move actions for your character
and mechs, mountains you control and all tunnels (including
your mine if you have one) are considered adjacent to each
other.
```
```
Disarm: Before you engage in combat on a territory with a
tunnel, the combating opponent loses 2 power. This loss of
power is reflected on the power track. You may do this once per
combat, not once per unit.
```
```
Speed: (see Rusviet listing for details).
```
#### FACTION ABILITIES

## RUSVIET

```
Relentless: You may choose the same section on your player
mat as the previous turn(s). This also applies to a factory card
if you have one.
```
## CRIMEA

```
Coercion: Once per turn, you may spend 1 combat card as if it
were any 1 resource token. Combat cards are still worth nothing
at the end of the game.
```
## NORDIC

```
Swim: Your workers (only) may move across rivers.
```
## POLANIA

```
Meander: Pick up to 2 options per encounter card. The benefit
from the 1st selected option may be used to pay the cost for the
2nd selected option. Only 1 encounter card is drawn.
```
## SAXONY

```
Dominate: There is no limit to the number of stars you can place
from completing objectives or winning combat. Don’t discard
the second objective card after achieving the first.
```
#### COMBAT

## SELECT POWER

```
Simultaneously and secretly select a number on your power
dial. You cannot choose a number higher than the amount of
power you currently have on the power track.
```
```
For each of your units (character and/or mechs) in the combat,
you may tuck 1 combat card from your hand behind the dial.
```
## REVEAL

```
Both players reveal their power dials and selected combat cards
simultaneously. The value from combat cards is a bonus to the
power you are spending, as indicated on your dial.
```
```
The player with highest total power wins (attacker wins ties).
Both players then pay the amount of power they selected on
their dial and discard any combat cards they used faceup.
The winner gains (or maintains) control of the territory and all
resource tokens on it, and places 1 star in the combat space
of the triumph track (if they haven’t already placed 2 stars for
combat victories).
```
```
If the winner was the attacker, they lose 1 popularity for each
worker they forced to retreat by initiating and winning combat.
```
```
The loser must retreat all of their units (mechs, characters, and
workers) from the territory to their home base. All resources
they were carrying remain on the territory.
If the loser revealed at least 1 power on the dial or through
combat cards, they gain 1 combat card as they retreat.
```
#### MECH ABILITIES

## RUSVIET

Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto farms and villages.

Township: For the purposes of move actions for your character
and mechs, villages you control and the factory are considered
to be adjacent to each other.

People’s army: In combat where you have at least 1 worker, you
may play 1 additional combat card. You still require a character
or mech to participate in combat.

Speed: Your character and mechs may move 1 additional
territory per move action. If any of those units move onto a
territory containing an opponent’s character, mech, or worker,
their movement ends and they cannot move again this turn.

Moving from 1 tunnel to another still counts as 1 move, so with
this ability you could move an additional territory before or after
moving through a tunnel. Your mechs can pick up or drop off
resources and workers in the middle of a move action.

## CRIMEA

Riverwalk: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto farms and tundra.

Wayfare: Your character and mechs may move from a territory or
home base to any inactive faction’s (any faction not currently in
the game) home base or your own regardless of the distance.

Scout: Before you engage in combat, steal 1 of the opponent’s
combat cards at random and add it to your hand. You may do
this once per combat, not once per unit.

Speed: (see Rusviet listing for details).

## NORDIC

onto a lake (during a move action or when retreating) or if a
character or mech transports resources onto a lake, you may
not leave those workers or resources on the lake after moving
off it, nor may a worker move off the lake without the assistance
of the mech. Lakes are territories, so if 2 factions have a lake
movement ability, combat may happen on a lake. You cannot
build a structure or deploy a mech on a lake.

to retreat after combat.

Speed: (see Rusviet listing for details).

## SAXONY

they were carrying remain on the territory.
If the loser revealed at least 1 power on the dial or through
combat cards, they gain 1 combat card as they retreat.
```

#### PLAYING WITH 6 OR 7 PLAYERS

The Crimean mech ability Wayfare should be replaced with this
new ability (replace the appropriate punchboard token on their
faction mat): Move to any unoccupied farm.

The Polania faction ability Meander should be replaced with this
new ability (replace the appropriate punchboard token on their
faction mat): Pick up to 2 options per encounter card. At end of
game, gain $3 for each encounter territory you control.

When determining the first player based on the lowest-
numbered player mat, use this order: 1, 2, 2a, 3, 3a, 4, 5.

## CLAN ALBION

## FACTION ABILITY

```
Exalt: After ending your character’s movement
(post-combat and post-encounter), you may place a
flag token on the character’s territory.
```
A territory may only have 1 faction token on it (1 flag or 1 trap).
Flag tokens may not be removed or moved once placed.

Each flagged token counts as additional territory for end-game
scoring if you control the flag token’s territory with a character,
mech, worker, or unoccupied structure and the flag token is not
on a territory adjacent to the Albion home base.

## MECH AND CHARACTER ABILITIES

Burrow: Your character and mechs may cross rivers into, or
out of, any adjacent tunnel territory. A territory containing your
mine counts as a tunnel territory, but a territory containing an
opponent’s mine does not.

Sword: Before you engage in combat as the attacker, the
defender loses 2 power. This reflected on the power track
(players cannot have less than 0 power), and happens once per
combat, not once per unit.

Shield: Before you engage in combat as the defender, gain 2
power. This reflected on the power track, and happens once per
combat, not once per unit.

Rally: When taking a move action, your character and mechs
can move to any territory that contains at least 1 of your
workers or a flag token, regardless of the distance.

## TOGAWA SHOGUNATE

## FACTION ABILITY

```
Maifuku: After ending your character’s
movement (post-combat and post-
encounter), you may place an armed
trap token of your choice onto the
character’s territory (even if that territory has an opponent’s
structure on it).
```
```
A territory may only have 1 faction token on it (1 flag or 1 trap).
Trap tokens may not be removed or moved once placed.
```
```
Each armed token counts as additional territory for end-game
scoring (no other units are necessary). It is not possible for
there to be enemy units with an armed trap.
```
```
Triggering a trap: If an opponent moves a unit onto a territory
with an armed trap token, that unit’s movement ends. Flip
over the token to reveal a penalty the opponent must incur if
possible. This happens before anything else. The trap token
remains on the territory and is now disarmed.
```
```
Structure interaction: An opponent may build a structure
on a territory with a trap. At the end of the game, if the only
player tokens there are the structure and the trap (armed or
disarmed), the player with the structure controls that territory.
```
```
Penalty list: Lose 2 popularity; lose 3 power; lose $4; discard 2
combat cards at random. Opponents should be made aware of
the various trap penalties before the game begins.
```
## MECH AND CHARACTER ABILITIES

```
Toka: Once per turn when moving, either 1 character or 1 mech
may move across a river. A mech can use this ability while
transporting workers. The character or mech may not move
across multiple rivers when using a move action on a factory
card.
```
```
Suiton: Your character and mechs can move to and from lakes.
If combat occurs on a lake, you may play 1 additional combat
card. You may do this once per combat, not once per unit.
```
```
If a mech transports workers onto a lake or if a character or
mech transports resources onto a lake, you may not leave those
workers or resources on the lake after moving off it, nor may a
worker move off the lake without the assistance of the mech.
```
```
You cannot build a structure or deploy a mech on a lake, but
you may place a trap there.
```
```
Ronin: Before combat where you have exactly 1 unit (0 workers
and either 1 character or 1 mech), you may gain 2 power on the
power track.
```
```
Shinobi: Your character and mechs can move to any territory
with a trap token, regardless of the distance. When using this
ability, if your character or mech ends their movement on the
same space as a disarmed trap token (ie, not in the middle of a
factory card’s move action), you may choose to arm the trap. If
using this ability results in combat, you may only arm the trap if
you win the combat.
```
#### INVADERS FROM AFAR

#### AIRSHIP MODULE

## SETUP

```
Each player takes the airship in their faction’s color and places
it on their home base.
```
```
Shuffle the 2 types of airship tiles separately. Reveal 1 red
aggressive tile and 1 green passive tile. Place these tiles on the
board next to the encounter deck. All player’s warships have a
combination of both abilities at all times.
```
## TERRITORY CONTROL

```
Airships never control territories, and can fly freely onto any
territory (even those controlled by opponents).
```
```
Unless you control a territory in some other way, if there are
resources on your airship’s territory, you cannot spend those
resources.
```
```
When alone on a territory at the end of the game, an airship
does not control that territory (or the resources there).
```
## TRANSPORTING RESOURCES OR WORKERS

```
Each aggressive airship tile features the ability to transport
either up to 3 resources or up to 2 workers. This ability is
constant and applies to all airships.
```
```
This operates the same as normal for pick up and drop off; it’s
always part of the move action. However the tokens are placed
on the airship miniature.
Resources remain under your control on the airship until you
spend them or choose to drop them on a territory (which you
can do at any time while moving the airship).
```
```
Resources on your airship count during end-game scoring.
A worker on an airship does not give you control of the airship’s
territory. Those workers cannot produce or trade on that
territory, nor can opponents interact with them.
```
```
Workers can only be dropped off on territories unoccupied by
workers.
```
```
A worker picked up by an airship cannot transport resources
onto the airship.
```
```
Albion can only use its RALLY ability to move to a territory with
Albion workers (or a flag) – the worker must be on the territory,
not on an airship.
```
## MOVEMENT

```
Select the move action and choose the airship as one of the
units to move.
```
```
You may move your airship up to the number of territories
indicated in the hex in the upper right of the passive airship
tile. Note you must complete a unit’s movement before moving
another unit.
```
```
Airships are not constrained by rivers or lakes, and may move
freely onto and off of any territory (even those controlled by
opponents).
```
```
Any number of airships may be on the same territory.
```
## OTHER NOTES

```
Airships do not benefit from mech abilities.
‘Unoccupied/occupied’ refers to the presence or lack of units.
A territory with at least 1 unit (worker, character, or mech) on
it is occupied.
```
```
If you use the move action of a factory card for your airship, its
range is increased by +1.
```
```
Airships may not move onto home bases, or through tunnels
and mines.
```
```
Having an airship on a combat territory does not increase the
number of combat cards you may play.
```
```
Airships do not trigger traps.
```
```
The Blitzkrieg ability allows combat between 2 airships. The
winner gains a star as usual. It is the only time an airship can
retreat (other units on the territory do not engage or retreat).
```
```
Advanced variant
Instead of all airships sharing the same 2 abilities, deal 1
aggressive and 1 passive tile to each player. The combination of
those abilities applies only to each player’s airship.
```
#### RESOLUTION MODULE

```
With this module, ignore the standard end-game trigger, and
instead the resolution tile for the current game determines
when and how the game ends.
```
```
Setup
Shuffle the resolution tiles and randomly select 1 (or choose if
you prefer), read it out, and place it faceup near the triumph
track. This tile applies to all players for the current game.
```
```
Rules
Some tiles allow players to place stars on the tiles, on objective
cards, etc. These still count for end-game scoring as if they
were on the triumph track. You can never place more than 6
stars, but it is now possible for multiple players to have 6 stars.
