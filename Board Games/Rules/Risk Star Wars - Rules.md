# Risk: Star Wars
## Brief Summary
Risk: Star Wars is a two-player card and dice-based game set in the Star Wars universe. Players control either the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire, battling across three simultaneous conflicts: the space battle around the Death Star, the shield generator assault on Endor, and the lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. The game uses a simple order system where players play cards to activate units and perform actions. Victory is achieved by succeeding in specific objectives for each conflict.

## Quick Start Rules Guide

1. Setup:
   - Place the three game boards (Death Star, Endor, and Vader vs. Luke) in the center of the table.
   - One player chooses the Rebel Alliance, the other the Galactic Empire.
   - Distribute ships, tokens, and cards as shown in the setup diagram.

2. Gameplay:
   - Players take turns, alternating between Rebels and Empire.
   - On your turn, play one order card from your hand to take actions.

3. Actions (based on the card played):
   - Space Battle: Move ships and attack enemy vessels around the Death Star.
   - Endor Assault: Rebels try to disable the shield generator; Empire defends.
   - Lightsaber Duel: Luke and Vader face off, rolling dice for combat.

4. Combat:
   - Roll dice equal to the number of attacking units.
   - Compare results to the target's defense value to determine hits.

5. Death Star:
   - Empire can fire the Death Star at Rebel ships or sectors.
   - Rebels aim to destroy the Death Star by attacking vulnerable sectors.

6. Cards:
   - Draw a new order card at the end of your turn.
   - Earn bonus cards by destroying enemy units or completing objectives.

7. Winning:
   - Rebels win by destroying the Death Star, disabling the shield, or defeating Vader and the Emperor.
   - Empire wins by destroying all Rebel ships, defeating the Rebel assault team, or defeating Luke.

Remember, each conflict can impact the others, so plan your strategy across all three boards!

## Factions/Civilizations
- Rebel Alliance: Focuses on hit-and-run tactics, uses a variety of ship types, and aims to destroy the Death Star
- Galactic Empire: Relies on TIE Fighters and the Executor, defends the Death Star, and tries to overwhelm the Rebels with superior numbers

## Additional Notes
The game is designed to recreate the final battle of Return of the Jedi, with each of the three conflicts potentially deciding the outcome of the game. The simple ruleset and short playtime make it accessible for casual players and Star Wars fans.
