# Star Wars: Legion - Rules

[[Star Wars Legion.pdf]]

THE GAME ROUND	
A game of STAR WARS: LEGION is played over six rounds. Each round consists of three phases.

COMMAND PHASE Players perform the following steps:
1.     Select Command Card: Each player secretly selects a command card from their hand and places it facedown on the table. Then, both players simultaneously reveal their cards.

2. Determine Priority: The player whose card has the fewest number of pips has priority.



This reference contains eight sections:

CARD ANATOMY	PAGE 4
This section provides an illustrated breakdown of each type of card in the game.
3. Issue Orders: Starting with the player who has priority, each player nominates a friendly commander and issues orders with that commander. The number of orders to be issued is indicated on the orders section of the chosen command card.



ARMY BUILDING	PAGE 5
This section describes how players can assemble an army from their units and upgrades to play a standard game.
4. Create Order Pool: Each player creates an order pool that consists of all of their order tokens that they did not place on the battlefield while resolving their command card.

SETUP	PAGE 6	ACTIVATION PHASE

This section details each step performed when setting up a standard game of STAR WARS: LEGION.

Starting with the player who has priority, players take turns activating units by following these steps:



ADDITIONAL TERRAIN RULES	PAGE 8
This section describes many of the common types of wargaming terrain and provides rules for using them in games.
1.     Choose Unit: The player either chooses a unit with a faceup order token or draws a random order token from their order pool and chooses a unit with a matching rank that does not have an order token.



VERTICAL MOVEMENT	PAGE 10
This section provides rules that allow miniatures to scale sheer surfaces.

GLOSSARY	PAGE 11
The majority of this reference is the glossary. This lists detailed rules and clarifications alphabetized by topic.

OPTIONAL RULES	PAGE 47
This section describes how to play a larger game and how to play a game with unlimited rounds.

INDEX	PAGE 2
This section provides a comprehensive list of topics and the locations to find them in this reference.

2. Activate Unit: The player activates the chosen unit, performing up to two actions and any number of free actions with that unit.

3. Place Order Token: The player places the unit’s order token facedown on the battlefield near the unit leader.

END PHASE

Players refresh the battlefield by following these steps:

1.     Discard Command Cards: Each player discards their revealed command card; it cannot be used again this game.

2. Remove Tokens: Players remove all aim, dodge, and standby tokens, as well as one suppression token from each unit.


3. Update Order Pool and Promote: Each player places one of their order tokens on each of their undefeated units’ cards with a matching rank. If all of a player’s commanders were defeated, they must promote a unit leader from one of their trooper units to be a commander




2
4. Advance Round Counter: The player who has the round counter sets it so the next highest number is displayed. Then, that player passes the round counter to their opponent.

THE GOLDEN RULES

The golden rules are fundamental concepts on which all other rules are built.

•     If something in this reference contradicts the Learn to Play booklet, the Rules Reference takes precedence.

•     If an effect on a card or another component contradicts rules found in the Learn to Play booklet or Rules Reference, that component takes precedence.
RESOLVING DISPUTES	
Players should always attempt to come to an agreement regarding disputes about situations on the battlefield. If players cannot come to an agreement, such as determining the range between two miniatures or line of sight from one mini to another, the player with the round counter should roll a red defense die; on a block (󲉣) result, that player’s interpretation of the situation is considered correct and play continues. On any other result, the interpretation of the player without the round counter is considered correct and play continues.


•     If a card effect uses the word “cannot,” that effect is absolute and cannot be overridden by other game effects.

ARMY BUILDING	
Rules ReferenceValue© LFL © FFG3•Luke SkywalkerWhen playing a standard game of STAR WARS: LEGION, each player brings their own custom army full of their favorite characters, fun strategies, and unique tricks.
Building an army allows players to create a force customized to their play style and strengths. One player might create a diverse and flexible force, while another may design an army that enacts a single strategy with merciless eficiency.


POINTS	

Each army consists of units, upgrade cards, and command cards. Units and upgrades both cost points, and the total point value of everything in an army cannot exceed 800.

FACTIONS	

There are two factions in the game: the Galactic Empire (Imperial) and the Rebel Alliance (Rebel). An army can include only units from the same faction. A unit’s faction is found on the upper-left corner of its card.


RANKS	

A unit’s rank is used for army building. Each army must include the following:
•• • Commander: One to two commander units. ••󲉱 • Corps: Three to six corps units.
••󲉳• Special Forces: Up to three special forces units. ••󲊅 • Support: Up to three support units.
••󲉲 • Heavy: Up to two heavy units.
UPGRADE CARDS	

Upgrade cards are equipped to units in an army. Each upgrade card costs the number of points shown on the lower-right corner of its card. For each upgrade icon in a unit’s upgrade bar, it may equip one upgrade card with the matching upgrade icon. A unit cannot equip more than one copy of the same upgrade card.
Some upgrade cards have restrictions in their card text. For example, an upgrade with the restriction “Stormtroopers only” can be equipped only by Stormtrooper units. Additionally, some upgrade cards have the restriction “Light Side only” or “Dark Side only.” The Galactic Empire is aligned with the Dark Side, and its units can equip “Dark Side only” upgrade cards, while the Rebel Alliance is aligned with the Light Side.

Rules Reference© LFL © FFG© LFL © FFG© LFL © FFG© LFL © FFG© LFL © FFG© LFL © FFG© LFL © FFG© LFL © FFG© LFL © FFGXXTo play a standard game of STAR WARS: LEGION, perform the following steps:

1.     Establish Battlefield and Gather Components: Establish a 3' x 6' battlefield on a flat surface. The players sit across from each other on the 6' edges of the play area and place their units, cards, order tokens, movement tools, and other game components off the play area. Then, they assign ID tokens to their units, if necessary.

2. Declare Terrain: It is important to determine what the terrain effects will be before the game begins. Players should briefly discuss each piece of terrain that is available for
the battle and come to a consensus on its cover type and other characteristics.

3. Place Terrain: Players cooperate to set up terrain in a mutually agreeable fashion. If they cannot or do not wish to, they may use the Competitive Terrain Placement rules found on page 9.

4. Select Player Color and Sides: The player whose army has the lowest point total chooses to be either the red player
or the blue player. Then, the blue player chooses one of the long table edges and sets their army near that edge. The red player takes the other long table edge. If both players’ armies have the same point total, roll a die or flip a coin to determine which player chooses to be red or blue.

5. Reveal Battle Cards: Shufle the objective, deployment, and condition decks separately. Then, draw and reveal three cards from each deck, laying out each category in a horizontal row oriented right side up according to the blue player’s side of the battlefield.

6. Define Battlefield: Starting with the blue player, players take turns choosing a category and eliminating the leftmost card in that category (see the example below). A player may also forfeit their opportunity to eliminate a card if they wish to do so. After each player has had two opportunities to eliminate a card, the leftmost card remaining in each row is the card used during the battle. If players eliminate the first two cards in a category, the final card cannot be eliminated.

7. Resolve the Objective and Condition Cards: Resolve any setup instructions on the objective card; then resolve any setup instructions on the condition card.

8. Deploy Units: Resolve any setup instructions on the deployment card; some deployment cards have ongoing effects during this step. Then, starting with the blue player, players take turns placing a single unit from their army within their respective deployment zones. Players continue taking turns until all units have been deployed.

9. Prepare Supply: Place the wound, suppression, aim, dodge, and other tokens near the battlefield to create the supply. The blue player takes the round counter and sets it to “1.” Then, players are ready to start the game!

ADDITIONAL TERRAIN
Rules ReferenceRULES	
Adding terrain to the battlefield presents unique gameplay challenges and opportunities. Just about anything can be used as terrain, from model train trees to wooden blocks and other toys. Many players even build their own custom terrain from craft supplies.
The terrain rules in this section are designed to accommodate the kind of custom-built terrain found on wargaming tables. However, for the purposes of STAR WARS: LEGION, all that matters is that players agree on which terrain to use and the rules governing that terrain before playing the game.
This process is quite easy, as players simply need to define the cover type and movement dificulty for each piece of terrain they have selected for the battlefield. This section includes rules for common terrain types, but players are free to expand or modify these rules as needed.


COVER TYPE	

Whether or not a piece of terrain provides cover varies from miniature to miniature. As a general rule, terrain that blocks line of sight to half or more of a mini provides cover, while terrain that blocks less than half of a mini does not. This means that trooper minis will frequently enjoy the benefits of cover, while vehicles often will not.
Terrain either provides no cover, light cover, or heavy cover, depending on its characteristics. Terrain that completely blocks line of sight always provides heavy cover.


MOVEMENT DIFFICULTY	

Whether or not a piece of terrain impedes movement varies from unit to unit.


OPEN TERRAIN

IMPASSABLE TERRAIN

Impassable terrain represents buildings, high walls, wrecked vehicles, deep chasms, and other major impediments. Often, impassable terrain will block line of sight for troopers entirely, but vehicles are frequently tall enough to see (and be seen) over it.
What is considered impassable terrain varies from mini to mini. Trooper minis treat anything higher than the height of their mini to be impassable terrain, while vehicles treat anything higher than half the height of their mini as impassable terrain. A unit cannot perform a standard move or a reverse during which it would overlap impassable terrain.


TERRAIN TYPES	
This section details many of the most commonly available pieces of terrain, but it is by no means comprehensive. Therefore,
the rules and tables herein are presented as guidelines rather than hard-and-fast rules. Ultimately, players should decide for themselves what they wish their battlefield to represent, adapting these rules as appropriate for their available terrain.


AREA TERRAIN	

The most common type of terrain on the battlefield, area terrain, includes woods, tall grass, rivers, and the ruined shells of blown-out buildings.
This type of terrain is sometimes built into the battlefield itself, but is often represented by a large, flat scenic base dotted with decorative three-dimensional terrain elements (such as trees) that can be removed to accommodate the movement and placement of minis.
It is easy to determine the boundaries of terrain if it is mounted on a base of its own, but some battlefields are more complex. If players wish to delineate an area of terrain that does not have
a clear boundary, they may choose a number of terrain pieces and draw an imaginary line around the outer geometry of those terrain (from a top-down perspective) to determine where the area of terrain begins and ends.



















8
Open terrain is the part of the battlefield that is relatively free from obstruction, such as open ground, grassy meadows, and flat sandy beaches. Most of the battlefield will generally be open terrain. Open terrain neither blocks nor impedes movement.


DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Dificult terrain is anything that impedes but does not completely block movement, such as craters, rubble, or woods. Troopers moving over barricades or up a steep but low hill also suffer the effects of dificult terrain.
A unit that begins a move, moves through, or ends a move with any of its minis in dificult terrain has its maximum speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.
The effect of dificult terrain is not cumulative with itself. A unit cannot reduce its maximum speed below 1 by moving though multiple pieces of dificult terrain.

HOLES AND TRENCHES	

Rules ReferenceDepressions in the battlefield like blast holes, craters, and trenches can provide trooper minis with cover, but are unique in that they only provide cover to minis that are fully within that terrain. Generally, unless these depressions are very deep, they provide cover only to trooper minis and not to vehicle minis.
When determining cover, if the attacker traces a line from their unit leader through a hole, crater, trench, or other depression, that depression is ignored when determining if a target mini
is obscured. However, a trooper mini that is overlapping this type of terrain (positioned within a crater or inside a trench, for example) has cover, even if the terrain does not obscure half or more of the mini.
Finally, trooper minis moving inside a trench treat it as open terrain, but trooper minis that move into, out of, or across a trench treat it as dificult terrain.

Terrain	Cover	Trooper	Ground	Repulsor Type	Movement Vehicle	Vehicle
Movement Movement
Blast Holes     Light	Difficult	Open	Open
Trenches	Heavy	Difficult	Open	Open
LARGE OBJECTS	

Large objects like buildings, moisture collectors, hills, and high walls have a substantial impact on the environment, often blocking line of sight and movement completely.
Some terrain pieces do not fit neatly into a single category, but are instead composed of several different terrain types. This is most commonly found in buildings.
Buildings come in all shapes and sizes, from the simple huts of Tatooine to the fortified bunkers constructed by the Galactic Empire. For the sake of simplicity, most buildings are generally best treated as large pieces of impassable terrain, but sometimes players may wish to incorporate more nuance.
In particular, buildings will sometimes have parts that are impassable while the rest is open or dificult terrain—a mini may be able to move through a doorway or a large window as open terrain, but the building’s walls are impassable. When using a piece of terrain with mixed types, players should clearly define the terrain so that there is no ambiguity.

To simulate two armies attempting to choose the optimal location for combat, the players may place terrain in such a way that they believe they will have an advantage.

1.     The players set aside an even number of terrain pieces that cover roughly a quarter of the battlefield, choosing some pieces that will block line of sight and some that will simply provide cover.

2. Starting with the player whose army has the lowest total point value (if both players’ armies have the same point total, flip a coin), players take turns placing a single piece of terrain on the battlefield, beyond range 1 of all other pieces of terrain. If terrain cannot be placed beyond range 1, the player may place it anywhere on the battlefield as long as it is not touching another piece of terrain.


3. After players have finished setting up terrain, proceed to step 4 of setup.

VERTICAL MOVEMENT 
Rules ReferenceTroopers occasionally find it advantageous to climb into a better firing position. To do so, they must engage in vertical movement. Vertical movement does not employ the movement tools. Instead, if a trooper unit leader is in base contact with a piece of impassable terrain, it may climb or clamber.
To climb, a unit must spend two move actions to safely move vertically up or down a distance of up to height 1 (a single segment of the range ruler)—but only if there is a flat surface to place the unit leader on at the end of this movement and if the unit can maintain cohesion.
At the end of this move, the unit leader is placed fully on the flat surface at the top (or bottom, if climbing down) of the impassable structure, as close to the edge as possible, and the other minis in the unit are placed in cohesion. To be in
cohesion, each mini in the unit must be placed no further away from the unit leader than the length of the speed-1 movement tool (for additional rules for placing miniatures in cohesion involving terrain, see “Cohesion” on page 18). Finally, each mini in the unit must also be within height 1 of the unit leader, measured from base to base.
When a unit climbs, anything higher than height 1 from the unit leader’s position is simply too extensive a climb to commit to within the span of a single activation.

However, a hasty clamber is sometimes worth the risks. Units can clamber, moving up or down a distance of up to height 1, by performing a single move action, but it is risky—the unit must roll 1 white defense die for each of its minis and suffer 1 wound for each block (󲉣) result rolled. A unit may also spend two move actions to move up or down in height up to height 2, but if it does so, it must roll two white defense dice for each mini in the unit and suffer one wound for each block (󲉣) result rolled (for additional rules, see “Climb and Clamber” on page 17).
When a unit clambers to move up or down ladders, steps, or carved footholds, it does not roll dice or suffer wounds. Players should define these areas of the battlefield in Step 2 of setup.

GLOSSARY	
Rules ReferenceThis glossary provides players with detailed rules for STAR WARS: LEGION.


ABILITIES	

Cards contain abilities that players can resolve to trigger various game effects.

•     Unit and weapon abilities can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and standby tokens. If a game effect specifically instructs a unit to gain an aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is different than performing an aim, dodge, or standby action and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim, dodge, or standby actions are performed.

Related Topics: Actions, Attack, Card Actions, Command 
Cards, Keywords, Exhaust, Free Actions, Free Card Actions, Movement, Upgrade Cards, Weapons



•     Abilities on unit cards are presented as keywords. The front of each unit card provides reminder text for that unit’s unit keywords. The back of each unit card provides reminder text for that unit’s weapon keywords.

ACTIONS	

During the Activation Phase, each unit can perform actions.



»     Reminder text is not an exhaustive description of the rules for a keyword. If a player has questions about how a keyword works, that player should refer to that keyword’s glossary entry.
•     When a unit is activated, it can perform two actions from the following list:

»     Move




•     Upgrade cards and command cards also contain abilities. Each ability describes when and how it is resolved.

•     If an ability is preceded by a card action (󲊂) icon, that ability can be performed as a card action as one of the two actions that a unit can perform during its activation.

•     If an ability is preceded by a free card action (󲊃) icon, that ability can be performed as a free card action in addition to the two actions that a unit can perform during its activation.
»     Attack

»     Aim

»     Dodge

»     Standby

»     Recover

»     Card Action



•     Some cards must be exhausted as a cost to perform the ability on the card. Such a card contains an exhaust (󲊄) icon.

»     If a card that has an exhaust icon is already exhausted, a player cannot resolve that card’s ability until the card is readied.

»     A unit can ready any number of its exhausted cards by performing a recover action.

•     If the timing of an ability uses the word “after,” that ability’s effect occurs immediately after the described timing event has occurred.

•     If the timing of an ability uses the word “when,” that ability’s effect occurs at the exact moment of the described timing event.

•     A unit cannot perform the same action more than once during its activation, except the move action, which can be performed multiple times.

•     If an ability is preceded by a card action (󲊂) icon, that ability is a card action.

»     Each card action is a unique action; a unit can perform different card actions during its activation. However, a unit cannot perform the same card action more than once during its activation.

•     If an ability is preceded by a free card action (󲊃) icon, that ability is a free card action. Free card actions do not count against the two actions that a unit can perform during
its activation.




•     If an ability allows a unit to trigger a game effect after that unit moves, the unit can trigger that game effect after it moves normally, performs a compulsory move, climbs, clambers, pivots, or reverses (but not after it withdraws).
»     Each free card action is a unique action; a unit can perform different free card actions during its activation. However, a unit cannot perform the same free card action more than once during its activation.




•     If an ability provides a unit with either a move or an attack during its activation, such as a move or attack granted by a command card, performing that move or attack is not an action and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after move or attack actions are performed.
•     Suppression and damage can reduce the number of actions a unit can perform during its activation.

•     Through the use of free actions, a unit can perform more than two actions.


11
•     If a game effect provides a unit with a free action of a certain type, such as a free attack action, performing that free action does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation, but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects and therefore does not allow a unit to perform the same
Rules Referencenon-move action more than once during its activation.

For example, Darth Vader performs a move action, triggering his relentless ability and allowing him to perform a free attack action. After this free attack action, Darth Vader still has one of his two actions remaining, but he cannot use this remaining action to perform another attack action.

•     If a game effect provides a unit with a free action without specifying a type of action, that unit may perform any action that it could normally perform. Performing that free action does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation, but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects and therefore does not allow a unit to perform the same
non-move action more than once during its activation.

•     During a unit’s activation, it is possible for it to perform multiple attacks through the use of command cards or other abilities. If a game effect provides a unit with an attack during its activation, and that attack is not an action or
free action, performing that attack does not count toward a unit’s limit of a single attack action per activation. It is not an action and therefore does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation and does not trigger abilities that occur after actions are performed.

For example, the “Son of Skywalker” command card is active when Luke Skywalker performs an attack action. After completing the attack, the command card allows him to perform an additional attack. This additional attack is not an attack action, and therefore can be performed, even though Luke Skywalker has already performed an attack action.

•     Game effects can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and standby tokens. If a game effect specifically instructs a unit to gain an aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is
different than performing an aim, dodge, or standby action and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim, dodge, or standby actions are performed.

ACTIVATING UNITS	
»     At the start of a vehicle unit’s activation, if that unit is damaged, it must roll a white defense die. If this roll produces a blank result, it can perform only one action, instead of two.

2. Rally: If the unit has one or more suppression tokens, it rolls one white defense die for each suppression token it has. For each block (󲉣) or defense surge () result the roll produces, the unit removes one of its suppression tokens.

3. Perform Actions: A unit that is not suppressed can perform up to two actions and any number of free actions. A unit that is suppressed or that has lost an action due to being damaged can perform only one action and any number of free actions.

»     After a player activates a unit, that player places its order token facedown (rank side down) on the battlefield near the unit leader.

ACTIVATION PHASE	

During the Activation Phase, players take turns activating their units.

•     Starting with the player who has priority, each player takes a turn activating one of their unactivated units. Players continue alternating turns until each unit on the battlefield has activated.

»     If one player has more units on the battlefield than the other player, after the player who has fewer units activates their last unit, the player who has more units
will take multiple consecutive turns until their last unit has activated.

•     When it is a player’s turn to activate a unit, he or she performs the following steps:

1.     Choose Unit: The player either chooses a friendly unit with a faceup order token or draws a random order token from their order pool and chooses a friendly unit with a matching rank that does not have an order token.

2. Activate Unit: The player activates the chosen unit, performing up to two actions and any number of free actions with that unit.



During the Activation Phase, players take turns activating their units.	3.

Place Order Token: The player places the unit’s order token facedown on the battlefield near the unit leader.



•


•

1.

12
When a unit activates, that unit can perform up to two actions.

The steps of unit activation are as follows:

Start of Unit Activation: If the unit has an ability that triggers “when” it activates or “at the start” of its activation, the ability triggers during this step.

•     If a player draws a random order token from their order pool and that order token does not correspond to a unit that can be activated—usually because that unit was defeated and removed from the battlefield—the player removes the order token from the game and draws a different token from their order pool.
•     After all units have been activated, the Activation Phase ends and players proceed to the End Phase.
ARMOR (UNIT KEYWORD)

Rules ReferenceActions, Issuing Orders, Order Pool, Order Tokens, Panic, Priority, Rank, Suppression


AIM	

Units can gain aim tokens that allow them to reroll dice during an attack.

•     When a unit performs an aim action, that unit
gains an aim token. The token is placed on the	Aim battlefield near the unit leader, and will remain        Token with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.
During the “Modify Attack Dice” step of an attack, if the defender has the Armor keyword, that unit can cancel all hit (󲉠) results produced by the attack roll.

•     The attacker resolves abilities during the “Modify Attack Dice” step of an attack before the defender resolves abilities during that step. As such, the Impact keyword can be used to change hit (󲉠) results to critical (󲉡) results before the Armor keyword can be used to cancel hit (󲉠) results.

•     When a player cancels a hit (󲉠) result, that die is removed from the attack pool.

Related Topics: Abilities, Attack, Cancel, Dice, Impact X 
(Weapon Keyword), Weak Point X: Rear (Unit Keyword)



•     Unit abilities and other game effects can allow units to gain aim tokens. If a game effect specifically instructs a unit to gain an aim token, that effect is different than performing an aim action and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim actions are performed.

•     During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to gain more than one aim token; however, that unit can perform only one aim action.

•     During an attack, a unit can spend one or more aim tokens to reroll up to two dice for each aim token spent.

»     Aim tokens are spent during the “Reroll Dice” substep of the “Roll Attack Dice” step of an attack.

•     To spend a unit’s aim token, a player removes it from the battlefield and places it in the supply.

•     If a unit has multiple aim tokens, that unit can choose to spend each subsequent aim token after determining the results of rerolls granted from a prior aim token.

•     A unit can reroll the same die multiple times by spending multiple aim tokens; however, each die can only be rerolled once per aim token.

•     During the End Phase, all unspent aim tokens are returned to the supply.

ARMY BUILDING	

See “Army Building” on page 5.


ARSENAL X (UNIT KEYWORD)

When choosing weapons during the “Form Attack Pool” step of an attack, each mini in a unit that has the arsenal x keyword can choose a number of its weapons equal to the value of x. Each chosen weapon contributes its dice and keywords to the attack pool.

•     To use a weapon during an attack, the defender must be at or within any of the weapon’s ranges.

•     A mini that has the arsenal x keyword can divide its weapons between any number of units, forming a separate dice pool for each weapon or combination of weapons.

Related Topics: Abilities, Attack, Attack Pool, Weapons


AT (RANGE)	

At is a term used on cards and in the rulebook when describing range.

Keyword), Ready X (Unit Keyword), Spotter X (Unit Keyword)


AREA TERRAIN	

See “Additional Terrain Rules” on page 8.
•     A unit is at a range if the portion of a miniature’s base that is closest to the object from which range is being measured is inside the segment that corresponds to that range.

•     If the base of the mini being measured to touches the raised line between two range ruler segments without crossing it, the mini is at the lower range segment that the line separates.

13
ATTACK	

Rules ReferenceUnits can perform attacks to attempt to defeat enemy units.

•     A unit typically performs an attack by performing an attack action during its activation.

•     During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to perform more than one attack through the use of card abilities or other game effects; however, that unit can only perform
one attack action during a single activation, regardless of whether it is an attack action or a free attack action.

•     During an attack, the unit that is performing the attack is the attacker and the target of the attack is the defender.

»     Multiple units can be chosen as defenders (see step 3).

•     There are two types of attacks: ranged and melee.

»     During a ranged attack, the attacker and defender are not in a melee, and the attacker can use only weapons that have a blue range (󲉬, 󲉭, 󲉮, 󲉯, 󲉰) icon.

»     During a melee attack, the attacker and defender are in a melee, and the attacker can use only weapons that have a red melee (󲉫) icon.

•     Command cards, unit abilities, and other game effects can allow units to perform attacks. The card granting the attack will specify whether the attack is an attack action, a free attack action, or neither.

•     To perform an attack, a player resolves the following steps:

1.     Declare Defender: The attacking player chooses one enemy unit to attack; this enemy unit is now the defender. Then, the attacking player measures the range from the attacker’s unit leader to the closest miniature of the defender to determine the attack’s range.

2. Form Attack Pool: The attack pool consists of all the dice the attacker will roll against this defender. When forming the attack pool, players follow these substeps in order:

a. Determine Eligible Minis: Each mini in the attacker is eligible to contribute to the attack pool if that mini has line of sight to any mini in the defender.

b. Choose Weapons: The attacker can choose one weapon from each eligible mini to contribute to the attack pool. To choose a weapon, the attacker must meet all requirements indicated by that weapon’s keywords, and
that weapon’s range must include the range of the attack, as determined from the attacker’s unit leader to the closest mini of the defender.

c. Gather Dice: For each eligible mini that chose a weapon, the attacker gathers the number and type of dice depicted on that weapon and places them on the battlefield near the defender.

3. Declare Additional Defender: If there are any weapons remaining that have not been added to the attack pool, the player may repeat steps 1–2, forming a separate attack pool with the new weapons.

»     An attack pool can consist of dice from different weapons, but all weapons with an identical name must contribute their dice to the same attack pool.

»     The dice in each attack pool should be placed near the corresponding defender.

4. Roll Attack Dice: The attacker chooses an attack pool and resolves the following substeps in order:

a. Roll Dice: The attacker rolls the dice in the attack pool.

b. Reroll Dice: The attacker can resolve any abilities that allow the attacker to reroll attack dice.

c. Convert Attack Surges: The attacker changes its attack surge (󲉢) results to the result indicated on its unit card by turning the die. If no result is indicated, the attacker changes the result to a blank.

5. Apply Dodge and Cover: If the defender has a dodge token or is in cover, the defender may spend dodge tokens and apply cover to cancel hit (󲉠) results. Dodge tokens and cover cannot be used to cancel critical (󲉡) results.

»     A unit can apply cover only against ranged attacks.

6. Modify Attack Dice: The attacker can resolve any card abilities that modify the attack dice. Then, the defender can resolve any card abilities that modify the attack dice.

7. Roll Defense Dice: Resolve the following substeps in order:

a. Roll Dice: For each hit (󲉠) and critical (󲉡) result on the attacker’s dice, the defender rolls one defense die whose color matches the defender’s defense, which is presented on the defender’s unit card.

b. Reroll Dice: The defender can resolve any abilities that allow the defender to reroll defense dice.

c. Convert Defense Surges: The defender changes its defense surge () results to the result indicated on its unit card by turning the die. If no result is indicated, the defender changes the result to a blank.

8. Modify Defense Dice: The defender can resolve any card abilities that modify the defense dice. Then, the attacker can resolve any card abilities that modify the defense dice.

9. Compare Results: The attacker counts the number of hit (󲉠) and critical (󲉡) results, and the defender counts the number of block (󲉣) results. Then, the defender’s total is subtracted from the attacker’s total, and if the attacker’s total is greater, the defender suffers a number of wounds equal to the difference.


14	»     Critical (󲉡) results have no additional effect.
Rules Reference10. Choose Additional Attack Pool: If the attacker has an attack pool that he has not rolled, the attacker repeats steps 4–9, choosing a new attack pool and rolling it against the defender it has been assigned to.

»     During an attack, if at any point the attack dice in an attack pool produce at least one hit (󲉠) or critical (󲉡) result and the defender is a trooper, the defender gains a suppression token.

ATTACK POOL	

An attack pool is a number of dice generated from weapons that are being used against a single target during an attack.

•     Each weapon that is used during an attack contributes one or more dice to an attack pool.

•     During an attack, the attacker can create multiple attack pools to attack multiple defenders. However, only one attack pool can be assigned to each defender.

•     An attack pool can consist of dice from different weapons, but all weapons with an identical name must contribute their dice to the same attack pool.

•     A weapon can only contribute its dice to an attack pool if the following restrictions are met:

»     The range of the attack is equal to or greater than the weapons’ minimum range and equal to or less than the weapon’s maximum range.


»     The miniature using the weapon has line of sight to at least one mini in the defending unit.

»     If the weapon can exhaust, it must be readied.

»     To add a weapon with the fixed: x keyword to the attack pool, the defender must be inside the specified firing arc of the attacking mini.

•     Each weapon that contributes dice to an attack pool also applies its keywords to that attack pool.

»     If a weapon has a keyword that allows a player to modify one or more dice in the attack pool, the player can use that effect to modify any dice in the attack pool, not just the dice that this weapon contributed.


»     If a weapon has a keyword that changes how the results of the attack roll affects the defender, the entire attack roll affects the defender in that way, not just dice that the weapon that has that keyword contributed.

For example, if a weapon that has the blast keyword contributed dice to an attack pool, the results from all the dice in that attack pool ignore the defender’s cover.

BARRICADES	

Rules ReferenceA barricade is a type of terrain.
BATTLE CARDS	

Battle cards are used to define the battlefield during setup.



•     The barricades in the core set provide troopers with heavy cover. Other barricades can provide different cover depending on their type (see page 8).

•     A barricade does not provide vehicles with cover.

•     All units can move over a barricade.

»     A barricade is dificult terrain for trooper units.
•     There are three types of battle cards: condition cards, deployment cards, and objective cards.

the Battlefield, Deployment, Objective Cards, Objective Tokens


BATTLEFIELD	



Related Topics: Cover, Dificult Terrain, See “Additional Terrain Rules” on page 8.


BASE	

Each miniature is afixed to a base.
The battlefield is the name of the play area upon which the game takes place.

•     Players should use a 3' by 6' battlefield for a standard 800-point game.

Related Topics: Defining the Battlefield, Deployment, Leaving 
the Battlefield



•     Trooper minis are afixed to small round bases.

•     Ground vehicle minis are afixed to medium, large, or huge notched bases.

•     Repulsor vehicle minis are afixed to medium, large, or huge notched bases by clear plastic stands.

•     The orientation of a mini afixed to a small round base has no gameplay implications. A player can freely rotate a mini afixed to such a base during its movement.

BEYOND (RANGE)	

Beyond is a term used on cards and in the rulebook when describing range.

•     A unit is beyond a range if no portion of the miniature’s base is between the first segment of the range ruler and the end of the segment that corresponds to the specified range.

Related Topics: Attack, At (Range), Range, Within (Range)



•     A mini afixed to a notched base cannot be rotated freely; during its movement, it must either pivot or move along the movement tool, keeping the notches in the base aligned with the movement tool.

Related Topics: Base Contact, Engaged, Melee, Miniature, Movement, Notch, Pivot, Troopers, Vehicles


BASE CONTACT	

Base contact refers to a miniature’s base physically touching something on the battlefield, typically a piece of terrain, another mini, or an objective token.

BLAST (WEAPON KEYWORD) 

An attack pool that includes a weapon that has the blast keyword ignores the effects of cover.

•     During the “Apply Dodge and Cover” step of an attack, the defender cannot use light or heavy cover to cancel hit (󲉠) results produced by an attack pool that contains a die that was contributed by a weapon that has the blast keyword.

Related Topics: Abilities, Attack, Attack Pool, Cover, Cover X 
(Unit Keyword), Dice, Weapons



•     If the bases of two minis are touching each other, those minis are in base contact.

•     If a mini’s base is touching a piece of terrain or an objective token, that mini is in base contact with that terrain or token.

•     Friendly minis from different units cannot be in base contact with each other.

CANCEL	

Rules ReferenceSome abilities allow a player to cancel a die result.

•     When a player cancels a die result, that die is removed and its result is ignored.

•     During an attack, the defender does not roll defense dice for any canceled hit (󲉠) or critical (󲉡) results.

Related Topics: Armor (Unit Keyword), Attack, Cover, Dice, Dodge, Pierce X (Weapon Keyword)


CARD ACTIONS	

A card action is a type of action. If an ability is preceded by a card action (󲊂) icon, that ability is a card action.

•     Each card action is a unique action; a unit can perform different card actions during its activation. However, a unit cannot perform the same card action more than once during its activation.

•     If a card action provides a unit with either a move or an attack, performing that move or attack is different than performing a move action or attack action, even though the result is the same.
CLIMB AND CLAMBER	

Climbing and clambering are types of movement that allow a unit to move vertically onto or over a piece of elevated terrain. While clambering, a unit might suffer damage.

•     If a trooper unit leader is in base contact with a piece of vertical terrain, it may climb.

»     To climb, if there is a flat surface to place the unit leader on at the end of this movement and the unit can
maintain cohesion, a unit can spend two actions to safely move vertically up or down a distance up to height 1. At the end of this move, the unit leader is placed on the flat surface at the top or bottom of the vertical structure, as close to the edge as possible.

•     If a trooper unit leader is in base contact with a piece of vertical terrain, it may clamber.

»     To clamber, if there is a flat surface to place the unit leader on at the end of this movement and the unit can maintain cohesion, a unit can spend one action to move vertically up or down a distance up to height 1, or two actions to move up or down up to height 2. At the end of this move, the unit leader is placed on the flat surface at the top or bottom of the vertical structure, as close to the edge as possible.



•     Card actions can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and standby tokens. If a card action specifically instructs a unit to gain
an aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is different than performing an aim, dodge, or standby action and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim, dodge, or standby actions are performed.

Related Topics: Abilities, Actions, Activating Units, Exhaust, Free Actions, Free Card Actions, Keywords, Upgrade Cards

»     After a unit clambers, roll one white defense die for each mini in the unit if the unit moved up to height 1, or two white defense dice if the unit moved up to height 2. For each block (󲉣) result, the unit suffers one wound.

-     This roll is made after moving the unit leader but before placing the other minis in cohesion.

-     These wounds must be assigned to non-unit leader miniatures first.



CHARGE (UNIT KEYWORD)	

After a unit that has the charge keyword moves into base contact to start a melee with an enemy unit, it may perform a free melee attack action against that unit.

•     This attack action is a free action and therefore does not count as one of the unit’s two actions.

•     A unit that has already performed an attack action during its activation cannot perform a free attack action.

•     A unit that has already performed a free attack action during its activation cannot perform another attack action.

Related Topics: Abilities, Attack, Base Contact, Free Actions, Melee, Melee Weapon, Movement


CLAIM	

See “Objective Token” on page 35.

»     A unit that has the expert climber keyword does not have to roll these dice and cannot suffer damage because of clambering.

»     Ladders, steps, or carved footholds aid vertical movement significantly. When a unit clambers to move up or down such an apparatus, it does not roll dice or suffer wounds. These features should be clearly defined during setup.

•     After the unit leader climbs or clambers, each other mini is placed in cohesion with that leader as normal.

»     Minis in the same unit can be placed on different vertical levels, but each mini must be within height 1 of its
unit leader.

•     When measuring cohesion between two minis that are placed on different vertical levels, a player should measure from the unit leader to each mini using the speed-1 movement template, measuring from a view above the battlefield as if the two minis are on the same vertical level (see the example on page 8).

»     When separated by vertical distances, the position of a mini from the position of their unit leader must also be within the distance of a legal climb move. If a unit leader is on top of elevated terrain, any minis in that unit that are below their unit leader must be in base contact with that terrain such that moving between the position of the leader and the position of any mini in the unit is a legal climb move.

Rules Reference-     For the distance between a mini’s position and its unit leader’s position to be a legal climb move, it must be height 1 or lower.

»     After climbing or clambering, the unit leader will by default be on the edge of the terrain closest to the point with which it was in base contact before climbing or clambering. Minis not placed on the same edge of the terrain as the leader must be placed in base contact with the terrain and as close as possible to this point.
CLIMBING VEHICLE
(UNIT KEYWORD)	

A unit that has the climbing vehicle keyword is treated as a trooper for the purposes of vertical movement.

COHESION	

Each non-leader miniature in a unit must be in cohesion with its unit leader.

•     After a unit leader moves, is deployed to the battlefield, or is displaced on the battlefield, each other mini in that unit must be placed in cohesion with that unit leader.



»     When placing a mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed onto elevated terrain unless that mini’s unit leader has just climbed or clambered onto the same level of that elevated terrain.

•     A mini is in cohesion with its unit leader if the distance between a mini and its unit leader is equal to or less than the length of the speed-1 movement tool.



•     A unit does not have to climb or clamber to move over or onto terrain that has a height that is equal to or less than the height of its unit leader’s mini.

For example, a Stormtrooper unit can move over a barricade by performing a standard move. However, the unit will reduce its maximum speed by one because the barricade is dificult terrain for trooper units.

•     A unit does not have to climb or clamber to move up a gradual slope such as a hill. As a general rule, if a miniature can be placed on a slope without falling over, units can move up that slope by performing a standard move. Players should clearly define terrain during setup.

•     When a unit climbs or clambers, its minis must be placed such that each mini’s base is fully on a flat surface; a mini’s base cannot overhang a ledge. If there is not room for a unit leader’s base on the surface that the unit is climbing or clambering to, or if any mini’s base cannot be fully on a flat surface and maintain cohesion, that unit cannot perform that climb or clamber action.

•     Vehicles cannot climb or clamber with one exception. A vehicle that has the climbing vehicle keyword is treated as a trooper for the purposes of vertical movement.
»     If the base of a unit leader is touching one end of the speed-1 movement tool, and the base of a different mini in that unit is touching the other end of the speed-1 movement tool, those minis are at the maximum distance of cohesion.

•     When a notched base mini is placed in cohesion, its base must be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit leader’s base.

•     When placing a mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed in base contact with enemy minis, unless the unit is in a melee (see “Melee” on page 32).

•     When moving a unit leader, a player can push aside any minis from that unit to make it easier to place the movement tool on the battlefield.

•     If moving multiple units at the same time because of displacement, a player can move the unit leaders from those units first, and then place the remaining minis in cohesion with their respective leaders.

•     When placing a mini in cohesion with its unit leader, that mini must be placed such that the distance between the mini and its unit leader could be made as a legal speed-1 move from the final position of the unit leader.



•     If a game effect triggers by a unit moving, that game effect can be triggered by climbing or clambering.

»     This means that when placing a mini in cohesion with its unit leader it cannot be placed on the other side of impassable terrain from its unit leader.

»     Notched-based minis must obey this rule; however, the speed-1 move between the mini’s position and the unit leader’s position is determined as if the unit leader can pivot up to 1800 before the move is measured.


18
Rules ReferenceFor example, a mini is placed such that the distance between it and its unit leader is equal to or less than the length of the speed-1 movement tool; however, there is a piece of blocking terrain between the mini and its unit leader. If the mini is placed in such a way that there is a legal speed-1 move around the piece of blocking terrain between the position of the mini and the position of the
unit leader, then cohesion is maintained, but if there is not a legal speed-1 move between the position of the mini and the position of the leader, then the mini is not in cohesion.


•     When separated by vertical distances, the position of a mini from the position of its unit leader must also be a legal climb move. If a unit leader is on top of elevated terrain, any minis in that unit that are below their unit leader must be in base contact with that terrain such that moving between the position of the leader and the position of any mini in the unit is a legal climb move.

COMMAND CARDS	

Each player resolves a command card during the Command Phase of each game round.

•     Each command card has a number of pips in the upper-left corner of the card. These are used to determine which player has priority each round.

•     Each command card indicates the number and type of units that can be issued orders, or it indicates the name or names of specific units that can be issued orders.




•     There are four command cards available to all commanders: “Ambush,” “Push,” “Assault,” and “Standing Orders.”

•     Each commander has three command cards unique to that commander. These cards can only be used if that commander is in the army.

»     Commander-specific command cards are identified by an image in the upper-right corner that matches the image on that commander’s unit card and by the name of that commander appearing below the name of the command card.

•     Each player begins the game with a hand of seven command cards.
•     The units indicated on a command card can be issued orders only if they are at range 1–3 of the nominated commander.

•     A player must issue orders to as many units indicated on a command card as possible.

•     Some command cards have abilities that provide players with unique game effects. Each ability describes when and how it is resolved.

•     Each command card that has not been returned to a player’s command hand is discarded during the End Phase and its effect ends.

•     During the Command Phase, a player must play a command card, if able.



»     A player must include two 1-pip cards, two 2-pip cards, two 3-pip cards, and the card “Standing Orders” in their command hand.

•     If a player cannot play a command card, and their opponent does, their opponent has priority regardless of how many pips are on their played command card.


19
•     If neither player can play a command card, the player with the round counter rolls a red die to determine which player has priority, as if both players had played command cards with the same number of pips (see “Priority” on page 37).

Rules ReferenceCommander•     If a player’s commander is defeated, any commander-specific command cards corresponding to that commander cannot be played during the Command Phase.

•     If a player reveals an illegal command card during the Command Phase, they replace that card with the “Standing Orders” command card, if able.

Orders, Order Pool, Order Tokens, Premeasuring, Priority, Range, See “Card Anatomy” on page 4, See “Army Building” on page 5.
-     The unit cannot have already received an order during the current Command Phase.

-     The unit must be at range 1–3 of the nominated commander.

-     If a unit type (e.g., trooper) is specified on the chosen command card, the unit being issued an order must be of the specified type.

4. Create Order Pool: Each player creates an order pool that consists of all of their order tokens that they did not place on the battlefield while resolving their command card.

»     It is recommended that players place their order tokens in an opaque bag; however, players can also create their order pool by placing each order token facedown near the battlefield and then shufling those tokens.



COMMAND PHASE	 •

After players resolve these four steps, play proceeds to the Activation Phase.



During the Command Phase, each player selects a command card from their hand and chooses a commander to issue orders to one or more units on the battlefield.

To resolve the Command Phase, players perform the following steps in order:

1.     Select Command Card: Each player secretly selects a command card from their hand and places it facedown on the table. Then, both players simultaneously reveal their cards.

»     If a player does not have a commander on the battlefield, he does not select or resolve a command card.

COMMANDER	

The  icon indicates that a unit has the rank of commander. Commanders are powerful heroes and villains that can issue orders to other units. When building a standard army, a player may
include up to two commander units.	Icon



2. Determine Priority: The player whose card has the fewest number of pips has priority.

»     If both cards have the same number of pips, the player who has the round counter rolls a red defense die
(six-sided red die). If the result of the roll is a block (󲉣), that player has priority. Otherwise, their opponent has priority.

»     If one player plays a command card and their opponent does not, the player who played a card has priority.

3. Issue Orders: Starting with the player who has priority, each player nominates a friendly commander and issues orders with that commander. The number of orders to be issued is indicated on the orders section of the chosen command card.

»     If a player’s card belongs to a specific commander, he must nominate that commander.

»     For a commander to issue an order to a unit, that unit must be eligible to receive that order. To be eligible, a unit must meet all of the following requirements:

•     Each unique commander has three
command cards specific to that commander which can only be used if that commander is included in an army.

»     Commander-specific command cards are identified by the image in the upper-right corner that matches the image on that commander’s unit card and by the name of that commander appearing below the name of the command card.

»     A player can include any number of a commander’s command cards in their command hand, but can include no more than one copy of each card.

•     If a player’s last commander is defeated, that player can promote a new commander during the End Phase.

»     To promote a commander, a player chooses any of their trooper units on the battlefield and places a commander token
next to that unit.	Commander »     When a player promotes a commander,             Token
they discard that unit’s order token from
the game and replace it with a commander-rank order token.


20
»     A player activates a promoted commander using a commander-rank order token instead of the rank printed on the unit’s card.

Rules Reference»     A unit that has been promoted to commander does not retain its previous rank. It is considered to be a commander and to have the rank of commander for all game effects and game play purposes.

»     In the rare instance where a player no longer has a trooper unit to promote, they no longer have a commander and cannot play command cards.
CONDITION TOKENS	

Some condition cards instruct players to place condition tokens on the battlefield. These tokens will have game effects specified by the
condition card.	Condition •     Miniatures can move through but cannot                Token
overlap condition tokens.

•     Condition tokens cannot overlap objective tokens, and vice versa.



•     If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may use that commander’s courage value instead of its own when checking to see if it is panicked.

•     Each condition token is marked with a different number of glowing dots. These dots are ignored unless the condition card specifically references them.


»     A courage value of “–” is considered infinite when checking whether a unit is panicked, including when a unit is using a friendly commander’s courage value.

COMPULSORY MOVE	

Some game effects require a unit to perform a compulsory mo when it is activated.

•     To perform a compulsory move, the unit performs a full move following the normal movement rules, using its
maximum speed.	action during its activation.


•     If it is impossible for a unit to perform a full move, it can perform a partial move instead, but the partial move must end as far along the movement template as possible.

»     If the unit performs a partial movement because it cannot perform a full movement, the unit immediately suffers a number of wounds equal to its maximum speed.

»     If the unit leader ends this movement with any part of its base outside of the battlefield, the unit is defeated.

•     A compulsory move is not an action.

•     After the “Rally” step of a trooper unit’s activation, if that unit has a number of suppression tokens equal to or greater than twice its courage value, it is panicked. A panicked unit still suffers the effects of being suppressed. In addition, during a panicked unit’s activation, it cannot perform free actions and must spend its remaining action to perform a move at maximum speed as directly as possible toward the nearest edge of the battlefield.

»     If the unit leader ends this movement with any part of its base outside of the battlefield, the unit is defeated.




•     A compulsory move can displace trooper minis.

CONDITION CARDS	

During setup, players choose a condition card to represent the battlefield environment. Each condition card affects the game in a unique way as described on the card.

•     Some condition cards utilize condition tokens.

Related Topics: Battlefield, Battle Cards, Condition Tokens, Defining the Battlefield, See “Setup” on page 6.
»     If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may use that commander’s courage value instead of its own when checking to see if it is panicked.

•     Some trooper units do not have a courage value. These units have a “–” on their unit card where a courage value would normally be.

»     A trooper unit without a courage value cannot be assigned a suppression token. As such, that unit cannot become suppressed or panicked.

COVER	

Rules ReferenceDuring a ranged attack, terrain that lies between two units can grant protection to the defender in the form of cover.

•     There are two only types of cover: light cover and heavy cover. Cover is usually granted by terrain.

1.     Determine Number of Obscured Miniatures: The player traces an imaginary line from the center of the base of the attacker’s unit leader to the center of the base of a mini in the defending unit. If the imaginary line crosses either a piece of terrain or another unit’s base, that mini is obscured. The player repeats this process for each mini in the defender to determine how many of those minis are obscured.



»     Barricades provide trooper units with heavy cover.

»     Custom terrain can provide units with light or heavy cover. Players should determine the cover type of all custom terrain before the game begins.

•     During the “Apply Dodge and Cover” step of a ranged attack, a unit that has light cover can cancel one hit (󲉠) result, and a unit that has heavy cover can cancel up to two hit (󲉠) results.

»     Critical (󲉡) results cannot be canceled by cover.

•     Various game effects, such as suppression tokens and the cover keyword, can improve a unit’s cover by one or more.

»     If the attacking unit leader’s base is touching a piece of terrain, that piece of terrain cannot cause a mini in the defender to be obscured.

»     Only ground vehicles can cause a unit to be obscured. If the imaginary line crosses a ground vehicle’s base, the defending unit’s mini is obscured, but if the imaginary line only crosses a trooper or a repulsor vehicle’s base then the defending unit’s mini are not obscured.

2. Determine Cover: If at least half of all of the defender’s minis are obscured, that unit has cover. The type of cover that unit has is determined by the object that is obscuring the minis, as follows:




»     When a unit that does not have cover improves its cover by one, it is treated as having light cover.

»     When a unit that does not have cover improves its cover by two or more, it is treated as having heavy cover.

»     When a unit that has light cover improves its cover by one or more, it is treated as having heavy cover.
»     If the obscured minis are obscured by a ground vehicle, that unit has light cover.

»     If the obscured minis are obscured by a barricade, and the defender is a trooper unit, that unit has heavy cover.

»     If the obscured minis are obscured by custom terrain, that unit has the cover that the custom terrain provides.




»     If a unit has heavy cover, that unit does not gain any benefit from improving its cover.

•     To determine if a unit has cover during an attack, a player performs the following steps:
»     In the case that some of the obscured minis are obscured by an object that provides light cover and some are obscured by an object that provides heavy cover, that unit has heavy cover, unless there are more minis that are obscured by an object that provides light cover, in which case the unit has light cover.





TERRAIN AND COVER	1
1.     At least half the minis in the defender are obscured
(three out of five), so the entire unit benefits from cover.	3 2. Two of the three minis are in light cover (woods) and
one is in heavy cover (the building, which completely blocks line of sight). Since more minis are in light cover than heavy cover, the unit is considered to be in light cover for this attack.


3. Additionally, because the line of sight is totally blocked from the AT-RT to one stormtrooper (from the top center of the AT-RT), that stormtrooper cannot be defeated, even if this unit suffers five or more wounds. In this situation, if the four visible minis (including the unit leader) would be defeated, then the remaining mini would become the new unit leader.

»     If an individual mini is obscured by both an object that provides light cover and an object that provides heavy cover, treat that mini as obscured by heavy cover.

(WEAPON KEYWORD)	

A unit that has a weapon that has the cumbersome keyword cannot both move and attack using that weapon during the same activation.

•     If a unit performs an attack with a weapon that has the cumbersome keyword during its activation, it cannot perform a move during that activation.
DEFEATED	

When a miniature is defeated, it is removed from the battlefield and cannot be used for the remainder of the game.

•     If a mini has a number of wounds equal to the unit’s wound threshold, that mini is defeated.

•     If a unit leader ends its movement with any part of its base outside of the battlefield, the unit is defeated.

•     In the rare situation in which a unit leader is defeated and there are still minis in that unit, the player who controls that unit must immediately choose another mini in that unit to become the unit leader—the player replaces the chosen mini with the unit leader mini.

»     If a unit leader is in contact with a claimed objective token when it is defeated, before that player removes the unit leader, they flip the objective token to its unclaimed side and return it to base contact with the unit leader. Then, the unit leader is removed from the battlefield and the objective token remains where it is and can be claimed following normal rules.

•     If a player’s commander is defeated, any command cards corresponding to that commander that are in a player’s hand can no longer be played.

DAMAGED	

A vehicle unit can become damaged when it has wound tokens equal to or exceeding its resilience value (see “Resilience” on page 39).
•     When a vehicle unit is damaged, it gains a	Damaged damaged token. The token is placed on the
battlefield near the unit leader and remains with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.
During setup, players define the battlefield by selecting objective, condition, and deployment cards. First, they shufle the objective, deployment, and condition decks separately. Then, they draw and reveal three cards from each deck, placing the three cards from each deck in horizontal rows, called categories, facing the blue player’s long table edge. Then, starting with the blue player, each player takes turns choosing a category and eliminating the leftmost card in that category’s horizontal row until both players have had an opportunity to eliminate two cards. After each player has had two opportunities to eliminate a card, the leftmost card in each category’s row that was not eliminated is the card used to define the battlefield for the game (see example on page 6).



•     When a player activates a damaged unit, before it performs any actions, it rolls a white defense die. If the result is a blank, that vehicle performs one fewer action during its activation.
•     A player may forfeit their opportunity to eliminate a card if they wish to do so.

•     If players eliminate the first two cards in a category, the final card cannot be eliminated.



»     A unit that loses an action in this way can still perform any number of free actions.

DEFLECT (UNIT KEYWORD)	

Rules ReferenceThe deflect keyword allows a unit to gain additional benefits from spending dodge tokens.

•     While a unit that has the deflect keyword is defending, if it spends a dodge token, any defense surge () results are converted to block (󲉣) results; additionally, if the attack is ranged, the attacker suffers one wound for each surge () result rolled by the defender during the “Roll Defense Dice” step.

•     The defender must spend a dodge token to gain the benefits of the deflect keyword. Spending this dodge token cancels one hit (󲉠) result, as normal. The defender may spend additional dodge tokens to cancel additional hits; however, doing so does not improve or add to the benefits of the deflect keyword.

»     If the “Rapid Reinforcements” condition card was selected during setup, each player will have set aside up to two units to deploy later during the game.

•     To deploy a unit, a player chooses one of their units and places each miniature of that unit within the boundaries of one of the deployment zones that matches that player’s color.

»     Each mini’s base must be completely within the boundary of a deployment zone—the base cannot cross a deployment zone’s imaginary boundary line formed by deployment markers and battlefield edges.

»     Each mini in a unit must be placed in cohesion with its unit leader.

Related Topics: Battlefield, Defining the Battlefield, See “Setup” on page 6.



•     If the defender uses the deflect keyword during an attack, it is possible for the attacker to be defeated during the “Roll Defense Dice” step. If the deflect keyword inflicts a number of wounds that causes the attacker to be
defeated, the attack still continues and the defender can still suffer wounds.

DIFFICULT TERRAIN	

Rules ReferenceDificult terrain is anything that impedes but does not completely block movement.

•     A unit that is disabled cannot reverse and must spend two actions to perform a standard move. A disabled unit can still perform a pivot action by spending one action during its activation.



•     While performing a standard move, a unit that begins its move with any of its minis in dificult terrain has its maximum speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.

•     While performing a standard move, a unit that would move through or enter dificult terrain with any of its minis has its maximum speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.

•     The effect of dificult terrain is not cumulative with itself. A unit cannot reduce its maximum speed below 1 by
moving though multiple pieces of dificult terrain. However, the effect of dificult terrain can be combined with other effects that reduce a unit’s maximum speed to cause a unit’s maximum speed to be less than 1.

•     When a game effect causes a unit to perform a standard move of a specific speed outside of its normal activation, that move is not affected by dificult terrain.

DISPLACEMENT	

When a ground vehicle moves through trooper miniatures, it displaces them.

•     When a ground vehicle mini moves along the path created by a movement tool, if its base would overlap any trooper minis, those minis are displaced.

•     When a repulsor vehicle mini’s final movement position would overlap one or more trooper minis during a compulsory move, those minis are displaced.

»     Repulsor vehicles cannot displace troopers when performing any move other than a compulsory move.



•     Dificult terrain also affects vehicles that are performing a reverse.

•     A unit can pivot, climb, or clamber while in dificult terrain without suffering any additional penalties.

•     Whether or not a piece of terrain is dificult depends on a unit’s type (trooper, ground vehicle, or repulsor vehicle). See “Additional Terrain Rules” on page 8.

•     Trooper units that are engaged cannot be moved through or displaced.

•     To displace a unit, players perform the following steps:

1.     Set Aside Minis: Any displaced minis are placed to the side of the battlefield without disrupting other minis or objects on the battlefield. If a unit leader is displaced, a player should mark its original position using a spare token.



For example, a barricade is dificult terrain for trooper units, but not for vehicle units. Both ground and repulsor vehicle units can move through barricades without incurring any penalties.

2. Move: The ground vehicle mini that displaced the trooper minis continues its move as normal, unimpeded by the minis it displaced.



»     When using custom terrain, it is important to define the dificulty of that terrain as it relates to each unit type prior to the beginning of the game.
3. Place Units: The player who did not move the vehicle takes all of the displaced minis (both friendly and enemy) and places them back on the battlefield.



Related Topics: Barricades, Impassable Terrain, Movement, Open Terrain, Reverse, Unhindered (Unit Keyword), See “Additional Terrain Rules” on page 8.


DISABLED	

A vehicle unit can become disabled when it has wound tokens equal to or exceeding its resilience value (see “Resilience” on page 39).

»     Each mini must be placed in cohesion with its unit leader.

»     If a unit leader was displaced, it must be placed within range 1 of its original position. After the leader is placed, any minis of that unit that are not in cohesion are
placed in cohesion; this could cause a mini that was not displaced to be moved.

»     When placing a displaced mini, it cannot be placed in base contact with an enemy mini.



•     When a vehicle unit is disabled, it gains a disabled token. The token is placed on the battlefield near the unit leader and remains with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.

Disabled Token

»     When placing a displaced mini, it must remain on its original elevation, if possible.





25
4. Gain Suppression: Each unit that had one or more minis displaced gains one suppression token.
1.     Discard Command Card: Each player discards their revealed command card; it cannot be used again this game.



»     A unit cannot gain more than one suppression token due to being displaced even if more than one of its minis was displaced.
»     If a player used the “Standing Orders” command card or was unable to play a command card this round, they will not have a card to discard.

DODGE	 3.

Update Order Pool and Promote: Each player places one of their order tokens on each of their undefeated units’ cards with a matching rank.



Units can gain dodge tokens that allow them to cancel hit results during an attack.

•     When a unit performs a dodge action, that unit
gains a dodge token. The token is placed on the	Dodge
battlefield near the unit leader and will remain	Token with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.

•     During the “Apply Dodge and Cover” step of an attack, a unit can spend one or more dodge tokens to cancel one hit (󲉠) result for each dodge token spent.

•     Dodge tokens cannot be spent to cancel critical (󲉡) results.

»     Excess order tokens are removed from the game. If all of a player’s commanders were defeated, starting with the blue player, players must promote a unit leader from one of their trooper units to be a commander, placing the commander token in the play area next to that mini. Then, that unit’s original order token is discarded, and a commander order token is placed on that unit’s card in its place.

»     In the rare instance where a player no longer has a trooper unit to promote, they no longer have a commander and cannot play command cards.



•     To spend a unit’s dodge token, a player removes it from the battlefield and places it in the supply.

•     During the End Phase, all of a unit’s unspent dodge tokens are removed from the battlefield.

•     When a unit spends a dodge token to trigger the deflect keyword, that unit also receives the benefit of that dodge token in addition to the effects of deflect.

•     Unit and weapon abilities can allow units to gain dodge tokens. If a game effect specifically instructs a unit to gain a dodge token, that effect is different than performing a dodge action, even though the result is the same.

•     During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to gain more than one dodge token; however, that unit can only gain one dodge token from performing a dodge action during a single activation.

•     A unit may spend a dodge token even if there are no hits to cancel.

4. Advance Round Counter: The player who has the round counter sets it so the next highest number is displayed; that is the number of the next round. Then, that player passes the round counter to their opponent.

»     After the sixth game round, the game ends.

EXPERT CLIMBER
(UNIT KEYWORD)	

Units that have the expert climber keyword are adept at quickly scaling vertical surfaces. When a unit that has the expert climber keyword clambers, it does not roll any white defense dice to suffer wounds.

•     The bases of some minis have firing-arc lines that players use to determine firing arcs for that mini.

•     Each firing-arc line begins in the center of a mini’s base and ends at the edge of a mini’s base.

»     The firing arc between the two firing-arc lines that extend to the front of a mini’s base is that mini’s front firing arc. The two firing-arc lines that form the front firing arc always have a notch between them.

»     The firing arc between the two firing-arc lines that extend to the rear of a mini’s base is that mini’s rear firing arc. The two firing-arc lines that form the rear firing arc always have a notch between them.

»     The firing arc between the two firing-arc lines that extend to the left of a mini’s base is one of that mini’s side firing arcs, and the firing arc between the two firing-arc lines that extend to the right of a mini’s base is that mini’s other side firing arc. Together these are that mini’s side firing arcs. The firing arc lines that form the side firing arcs do not have notches between them.

•     To determine each of the edges of a unit’s firing arc, a player aligns the edge of the range ruler with the firing-arc line on a unit’s base to create one continuous line.

•     If any part of a mini’s base is inside a firing arc, that mini’s unit is inside that firing arc.

FREE ACTIONS	

Through the use of free actions, a unit can perform more than two actions during its activation.

•     A unit cannot perform the same action more than once during its activation, except the move action, which can be performed multiple times.
A free card action is a type of free action. If an ability is preceded by a free card action (󲊃) icon, that ability is a free card action. Free card actions do not count against the two actions that a unit can perform during its activation.

•     Each free card action is a unique action; a unit can perform different free card actions during its activation. However, a unit cannot perform the same free card action more than once during its activation.

•     Card actions can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and standby tokens. If a card action specifically instructs a unit to gain an aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is
different than performing an aim, dodge, or standby action and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim, dodge, or standby actions are performed.

•     If a game effect provides a unit with a free action of a certain type, such as a free attack action, performing that free action does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation, but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects and therefore does not allow a unit to perform a non-move action more than once during its activation.

For example, Darth Vader performs a move action, triggering his relentless ability and allowing him to perform a free attack action. After this free attack action, Darth Vader still has one of his two actions remaining, but he cannot use this remaining action to perform another attack action.

•     If a game effect provides a unit with a free action without specifying a type of action, that unit may perform any action that it could normally perform. Performing that free action does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation, but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects and therefore does not allow a unit to perform a non-move action more than once during its activation.

•     A trooper unit that loses an action because it is suppressed can still perform any number of free actions.

GUARDIAN X
(UNIT KEYWORD)	

While a friendly trooper unit at range 1 and in line of sight is defending against a ranged attack, a unit that has the guardian x keyword may cancel up to x hit (󲉠) results. For each hit (󲉠) result canceled, the unit with the guardian x keyword rolls
a defense die matching its defense. After converting defense surge () results according to its surge chart, the unit with the guardian x keyword suffers 1 wound for each blank result.

•     guardian x cannot be used to cancel critical (󲉡) results.


•     Hit (󲉠) results are canceled during the “Modify Attack Dice” step of an attack.
28
•     A unit that uses guardian x to cancel hit (󲉠) results is not a defender and does not gain suppression tokens.
ID TOKENS	




Rules Reference•     A defender that has all of its hit (󲉠) results canceled by a unit with guardian x is still the defender, and gains a suppression token as normal.

•     A unit cannot use guardian x if the defender also has the guardian x keyword.
ID tokens help players keep track of multiple units of the same type that have different upgrade cards. When deploying such units, place a unique ID token near
the base of the unit leader of each unit.	ID Tokens
Then, place each unit’s matching ID token on its corresponding card.



•     The pierce x keyword can be used to cancel block (󲉣) results on defense dice rolled by a unit using guardian x; treat canceled block (󲉣) results as blank results. After using pierce x in this way, any unused pierce x value can still be used to cancel block (󲉣) results rolled by the defender.

For example, a unit with pierce 3 attacks an enemy unit, and another enemy unit uses guardian 2 to cancel 2 hit (󲉠) results. After converting surge () results, the unit using guardian has rolled 2 block (󲉣) results. The attacking unit
uses pierce to cancel the 2 block (󲉣) results and the unit using guardian suffers 2 wounds. Now the defender rolls defense dice, and the attacking unit can cancel 1 more block (󲉣) result rolled by the defender since only 2 of its original pierce 3 was used so far.

•     To measure an object’s height, a player places the end of the range ruler flat on the battlefield’s surface as close to the object as possible; the range ruler should be oriented vertically. The segment of the range ruler that the top of the object is at is equal to that object’s height.

»     If the top of the object meets the line between two range ruler segments without crossing that line, that object’s height is equal to the lower range segment that the line separates. Otherwise, the height of the object is equal to the higher range segment that the line separates.

•     Some terrain may have multiple surfaces at various heights. When determining the height of a surface for the purposes of climbing or clambering, a player measures from the surface their miniatures are on to the surface those minis are climbing or clambering to.

IMPACT X
Rules Reference(WEAPON KEYWORD)	

During the “Modify Attack Dice” step of an attack, a unit whose attack pool includes a weapon that has the impact x keyword can modify the results of the attack roll by changing hit (󲉠) results to critical (󲉡) results. The unit can change a number of hit (󲉠) results to critical (󲉡) results up to the value of x.

•     If the attacker is performing an attack against multiple targets, the attacker can modify only dice in the attack pool that the weapon with the impact x keyword contributed to.

•     If a unit performs an attack using multiple weapons that have the impact x keyword and those weapons contribute dice to the same attack pool, the x values of each impact x keyword are cumulative.

For example, a unit that performs an attack using both a weapon that has impact 1 and a weapon that has impact 2 contribute dice to the attack pool, that attack is treated as
using a weapon that has impact 3 which allows that unit to change up to three hit (󲉠) results to critical (󲉡) results.

•     The attacker resolves abilities during the “Modify Attack Dice” step of an attack before the defender resolves abilities during that step. As such, the impact x keyword can be used to change hit (󲉠) results to critical (󲉡) results before the armor keyword can be used to cancel hit (󲉠) results.

ION X (WEAPON KEYWORD) 

The ion x keyword is used to force enemy units to gain ion tokens.

•     A vehicle that suffers wounds after defending against an attack that includes a weapon that has the ion x keyword gains x ion tokens.



•     Units cannot move through impassable terrain.

•     Whether or not a piece of terrain is impassable depends on a unit’s type (trooper, ground vehicle, or repulsor vehicle). See “Additional Terrain Rules” on page 8.

For example, a barricade is dificult terrain for trooper units, but not for vehicle units. Both ground and repulsor vehicle units can move through barricades without incurring any penalties.

»     When using custom terrain, it is important to define the dificulty of that terrain as it relates to each unit type prior to the beginning of the game.

ISSUING ORDERS	

During the Command Phase, when it is a player’s turn to resolve their revealed command card, they nominate one of their commanders on the battlefield. That commander issues orders to the number and type of units presented on the revealed command card.

•     A unit needs to fulfill the following criteria to be issued an order:



Related Topics: Dificult Terrain, Movement, Open Terrain, See “Additional Terrain Rules” on page 8.

»     The unit must be of a type presented on the player’s revealed command card.


»     The unit must be at range 1–3 of the player’s nominated commander.

»     The unit cannot have already received an order during 30	the current game round.
•     When a unit is issued an order, a player places an order token that matches the faction and rank of the unit receiving the orders near that unit on the battlefield; the player places the order token so its rank is faceup.

Rules Reference•     If a player does not have a commander on the battlefield, that player cannot play a command card during the Command Phase.

•     Each unit keyword provides a unit with an ability, including the timing of when the ability is used as well as the effect of the ability.

•     Each weapon keyword adds an ability to the attack pool in which it is included.

•     The front of each unit card provides reminder text of each of that unit’s keywords. The back of each unit card provides reminder text for each of that unit’s weapon keywords.





JUMP X (UNIT KEYWORD)	

A unit that has the jump x keyword can perform the jump x card action. To perform this action, the unit performs a move as normal. However, the unit can pass over or end its movement on top of terrain that is height x or lower, measured from the unit’s starting position.

•     When a unit performs the jump x card action, treat this action as a move action.
»     The reminder text is not an exhaustive description of the rules for a keyword. Rather, it is there to help players remember how and when to resolve each keyword. If a player has questions about how a keyword works, that player should refer to that keyword’s glossary entry.

LEADER	

See “Unit Leader” on page 44.



•     When a unit performs the jump x action, measure height from that unit’s starting position.

For example, Luke Skywalker uses the jump 1 keyword to perform a move. Luke Skywalker’s starting position is on top of height 1 terrain. He may end his move on height 2 terrain or lower.

•     When a unit performs the jump x action, it may end its movment at any height lower than its starting position, regardless of the value of x.

LEAVING THE BATTLEFIELD 

If at any time a unit leader ends its movement with any part of its base outside of the battlefield, that unit is defeated.

LINE OF SIGHT	



For example, Luke Skywalker uses the jump 1 keyword to perform a move. Luke Skywalker’s starting position is on top of height 2 terrain. He may chose to end his move at a point on the battlefield that is lower than his starting position, even if the difference between his starting and final position is greater than height 1.

Related Topics: Abilities, Actions, Card Actions, Height, Movement, See “Additional Terrain Rules” on page 8.

Line of sight is used to determine if one mini can see another mini. A player determines line of sight from the perspective of a mini, using a viewpoint where the center of the mini’s base meets the top of the mini’s sculpt. If a player can see part of
an opponent’s mini, which includes that mini’s base, from that viewpoint, that player’s mini has line of sight to that opponent’s mini.

•     If a mini does not have line of sight to another mini, line of sight is blocked.

KEYWORDS	       »     Pieces of terrain and vehicles can block line of sight.


A keyword is an ability possessed by units or weapons.

•     There are two types of keywords: unit keywords and weapon keywords.

»     A unit keyword is an inherent ability of a unit and it is presented on a unit’s card or added to a unit by an upgrade card.

»     A weapon keyword is an inherent ability of a weapon and is presented as part of a weapon on either a unit’s card or an upgrade card.

»     Trooper minis do not block line of sight. When determining line of sight, if a player cannot see a mini because it is concealed by one or more troopers on the battlefield, and that player could otherwise see the mini, that player’s mini has line of sight to the mini that is concealed by one or more troopers.

•     During an attack, each mini in the attacker can contribute dice to the attack pool if that mini has line of sight to any mini in the defender.


31
•     During an attack, if line of sight to a mini in the defender is blocked from all minis in the attacker, that mini in the defender cannot suffer wounds.

MELEE	

Melee represents close combat between opposing units. When two miniatures from opposing players’ units are in base contact, those units are in a melee.

•     If two trooper units are in a melee, those units are engaged. Any unit type can be in a melee, but only troopers can
be engaged.

•     When a unit performs an attack against a unit that it is in a melee with, that attack is a melee attack. Melee
attacks follow the same rules as ranged attacks with the following exceptions:
•     You cannot move a unit such that it would be in base contact with multiple enemy units–effectively starting a melee.

•     It is possible to be in a melee with multiple units if another unit joins later.

•     A unit that does not have a melee weapon cannot move in a way that would start a melee.

•     When moving minis into base contact with enemy minis after a melee has been started, if there is not space to place a mini in base contact with an enemy mini in the same melee, that mini must still be placed in cohesion.

•     Minis that are not in base contact with an enemy mini can still contribute to a melee attack if the unit to which that mini belongs is in a melee.

•     Whenever there are minis that are not in base contact with an enemy mini but those minis have a melee weapon and the unit to which they belong is in a melee, those minis must be placed in base contact with an enemy mini in the same melee as their unit if possible. This can happen when minis in a melee suffer wounds and are defeated, creating space
for other minis that were not previously in base contact to be place in base contact. If both players own minis that are not in base contact with an enemy mini and should be, the player that is currently activating a unit or has most recently activated a unit (even if that unit is not the unit with minis that should be placed in base contact with enemy minis) should move their minis into base contact with enemy minis before the other player does so. If neither play has activated a unit yet this round, the blue player should move their minis first.

•     If a unit has a melee weapon, it can start a melee by moving into base contact with an enemy miniature. To start a melee, a player must follow these steps in order:

1.     Move Unit Leader: The player performs a move, moving their unit leader into base contact with an enemy mini.

2. Move Other Minis: Maintaining cohesion, the player places each other mini in the unit that started the melee into base contact with enemy minis that belong to the same enemy unit that their unit leader is now in melee with.

3. Opponent Moves Minis: Maintaining cohesion, the player’s opponent moves any of their own minis that belong to the unit that is now in a melee (that are not already in base contact with an enemy mini) into base contact with minis from the unit that started the melee.

»     If the opponent’s unit does not have a melee weapon, the opponent does not move their minis into base contact

MINIATURE	

Each plastic sculpt is a miniature, often abbreviated as a “mini.”

•     Each mini is afixed to a base and is part of a unit.

•     Trooper minis are afixed to small round bases.

•     Ground vehicle minis are afixed to medium, large, or huge notched bases.

•     Repulsor vehicle minis are connected to medium, large, or huge notched bases by clear plastic stands.

Related Topics: Base, Notch, Troopers, Unit, Vehicles


MOVEMENT	

Each unit can move about the battlefield in multiple ways.

•     The primary way that units move is by performing a move action. When a unit performs a move action, it performs a standard move, reverse, pivot, climb, or clamber.

3. Adjust Movement Tool: The player can adjust the movement tool at its joint, bending it as they desire. The movement tool creates a path along which the mini will move.

4. Execute Full or Partial Move: The player executes either a full or partial move.

»     Full: Holding the movement tool in place, the player lifts up the unit leader mini and moves it along the path of the movement tool, keeping the mini’s base centered in relation to the width of the tool. Then, if the mini has an unnotched base, the player places the mini’s base flush against the other end of the movement tool; if the mini has a notched base, the player places the mini so the other end of the movement tool is inserted into the rear notch of the mini’s base.

»     Partial: Holding the movement tool in place, the player lifts up the unit leader mini and moves it along the path of the movement tool, keeping the mini’s base centered in relation to the width of the tool. Then, the player places the mini anywhere along the path created by
the movement tool, moving the movement tool out of the way and placing the mini on the battlefield. When placing a mini with a notched base during a partial move, the unit must be placed such that the central axis of the mini’s front and back notches is parallel to the section of the movement tool the mini reached at the furthest part of its move.

5. Establish Cohesion: The player places all minis of the moving unit that are not the unit leader in cohesion with the unit leader (see “Cohesion” on page 18).

»     When a notched base mini is placed in cohesion, its base must be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit leader’s base.

•     In addition to a standard move, each unit type can perform other types of moves, as follows:



•     To perform a standard move, a player performs the following steps:

1.     Take Movement Tool: The player chooses a movement tool.

»     Troopers can climb and clamber.

»     Troopers in an engagement can withdraw.




»     Each unit has a maximum speed of one, two, or three, which is represented by a number of red bars on the unit’s card. When a unit performs a standard move, it uses a movement tool with a value equal to or less than its maximum speed.

2. Place Movement Tool: The player places the movement tool against the moving unit’s base, according to the type of base:
»     Repulsor vehicles can pivot and move through troopers.

»     Ground vehicles can pivot, reverse, and displace troopers.

•     During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to perform multiple move actions. Unlike other actions, a unit is not limited to only one move action per activation.




»     Unnotched Base: The player places one end of the movement tool flush against any portion of the unit leader mini’s base.

»     Notched Base: The player places one end of the movement tool into the front notch of the vehicle’s base.
•     While moving a mini along a path created by a movement tool, if the base of the mini is impeded by an object, that mini must stop its movement prematurely unless the mini can legally move through, over, or on top of the obstructing object.


33
•     While performing a standard move or a reverse, if it is obvious that the mini will be unimpeded while moving along the path created by the movement tool, the mini can be placed directly at its final destination.
REPULSOR VEHICLE MOVEMENT SUMMARY

Rules Reference•     A repulsor vehicle mini can move through all types of units.



•     While moving a unit, if a movement tool cannot lie flat on the battlefield, the player can hold the tool above any objects that prevent the tool from lying flat, or mark the objects’ positions and move them out of the way while performing the move.

•     A mini can move into base contact with an enemy mini only if the unit performing the move has a melee weapon and is entering into a melee with that enemy unit.

•     If a unit leader performs a move that causes any part of its base to leave the battlefield, that unit is destroyed.

•     A repulsor vehicle mini cannot reverse, climb, or clamber.

•     While performing a standard move, a repulsor vehicle mini can move onto or over a piece of a terrain that has a height that is equal to or less than the height of the unit leader’s mini.

•     When a repulsor vehicle mini’s final movement position would overlap one or more trooper minis during a compulsory move, those minis are displaced.

»     Repulsor vehicles cannot displace troopers when performing any move other than a compulsory move.



TROOPER MOVEMENT SUMMARY

GROUND VEHICLE MOVEMENT SUMMARY

•     A ground vehicle mini can move through friendly and enemy repulsor vehicle minis.

Some units, notably vehicles, have front and rear notches on their bases.

•     When a mini with a notched base performs a move, a player places the movement tool into either the front or rear notch on the base.



•     A ground vehicle mini cannot climb or clamber unless it has the climbing vehicle keyword.

•     A ground vehicle mini can reverse.

•     A ground vehicle mini can displace friendly and enemy trooper minis by moving through them.

»     A ground vehicle mini cannot move through or displace a trooper mini that is engaged.
»     When performing a standard move, they begin by placing the start of the movement tool into the front notch of the mini’s base. When finishing a full move, they place the rear notch of the mini’s base onto the end of the movement tool.

»     When performing a reverse, they begin by placing the start of the movement tool into the rear notch of the mini’s base. When finishing a full reverse, they place the front notch of the mini’s base onto the end of the movement tool.

OBJECTIVE CARDS	

Rules ReferenceObjective cards determine the objectives that players are battling for during a game.
OBSCURED	

See “Cover” on page 22



•     Players determine an objective for a game while defining the battlefield during setup.

•     Each objective card describes where to place objective tokens and how players gain victory tokens by claiming or controlling those objectives.

OPEN TERRAIN	

Open terrain is any area of the battlefield that does not hinder movement.

•     Units can move through open terrain unimpeded.



•     Each objective card contains a “Victory” box, which describes how victory tokens are earned or the game is won.

Related Topics: Battlefield, Defining the Battlefield, Objective 
Tokens, Victory Tokens, Winning the Game, See “Setup” on page 6.


OBJECTIVE TOKENS	

Many objective cards instruct players to place objective tokens on the battlefield. Players can claim objective
tokens to earn victory points.
Claimed	Unclaimed •     Miniatures can move through but	Objective       Objective
cannot overlap objective tokens.	Token	Token

•     Whether or not a piece of terrain is open depends on a unit’s type (trooper, ground vehicle, or repulsor vehicle). See “Additional Terrain Rules” on page 8.

For example, a barricade is dificult terrain for trooper units, but not for vehicle units. Both ground and repulsor vehicle units can move through barricades without incurring any penalties.

»     When using custom terrain, it is important to define the dificulty of that terrain as it relates to each unit type prior to the beginning of the game.

Related Topics: Dificult Terrain, Impassable Terrain, Movement, See “Additional Terrain Rules” on page 8.




•     Each objective token has two sides, a claimed side and an unclaimed side.

•     Some objective cards specify that objective tokens can be claimed by units. To claim an objective, follow these rules:
ORDER POOL	

During the Command Phase, each player creates an order pool that consists of the order tokens that the player did not issue while resolving their command card.



»     Only a unit leader can claim an objective token. To claim an objective token, a unit’s leader must be in base contact with the objective token.
•     When activating a unit during the Activation Phase, a player can choose to take an order token at random from their order pool.



»     When a unit leader claims an objective token, that player flips the objective token from its unclaimed side to the claimed side and places it in base contact with the unit leader. The token will remain in base contact with the unit leader as it moves around the battlefield, unless the unit leader becomes panicked or is defeated.

»     If a player’s unit leader with a claimed objective token becomes panicked or is defeated, before that player removes or moves the unit leader, they flip the objective token to its unclaimed side and place it in base contact with the unit leader. The objective token remains on the battlefield where it was placed and can be claimed again as normal.

•     If the objective card does not specify that objective tokens can be claimed, tokens cannot be claimed this game. Instead, these tokens are used to mark areas or serve other purposes, as described by the objective card.
»     Then, the player activates a unit with a rank that corresponds to the rank on the order token they took.

•     It is recommended that players create their order pool by placing their order tokens in an opaque bag or container; however, players can also create their order pool by placing their order tokens facedown in a randomized stack near the battlefield.

•     If a player draws a token that does not match the rank of a unit they have in play, that token is removed from the order pool and a new one is drawn.

ORDER TOKENS	

Rules ReferenceEach unit has an order token that matches both its faction and its rank. Players use these order tokens to activate their units.

•     One side of an order token depicts
the unit’s faction: Galactic Empire	Order Tokens or Rebel Alliance. The other side of
the order token depicts the unit’s rank: commander (), corps (󲉱), special forces (󲉳),
support (󲊅), or heavy (󲉲). A token with its rank side showing is faceup.

•     During the Command Phase, when a player issues orders to a unit by playing a command card, that player places an
order token displaying that unit’s rank on the battlefield next to that unit; the player places the order token so its rank side is faceup.

•     After issuing orders to units during the Command Phase, a player places any order tokens not on the battlefield into that player’s order pool.

•     During the Activation Phase, a player either activates a friendly unit with a faceup order token or takes a random order token from their order pool and activates a friendly unit with a matching rank that does not have an order token.

•     After a player activates their unit, they place that unit’s order token near that unit on the battlefield so its rank side is facedown and its faction side is faceup. This facedown order token indicates that the unit has activated during this game round.

•     When a unit is defeated, its order token is removed from the game, either when an order token is drawn from the pool that does not match the rank of any unactivated unit on the battlefield, or in the End Phase.

PANIC	

If a unit receives too much suppression, it can become panicked and attempt to flee the battlefield.

•     After the “Rally” step of a unit’s activation, if	Panic
the unit has a number of suppression tokens	Token that is equal to or greater than double its
courage value, that unit is panicked.

»     If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may use that commander’s courage value instead of its own when checking if it is panicked.

•     When a unit becomes panicked, it gains a panic token. The token is placed on the battlefield near the unit leader and will remain with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.

•     After the “Rally” step of a unit’s activation, if that unit is panicked, it can perform only one action instead of two, and that action must be a move action toward the nearest battlefield edge.

•     When performing its move action, a panicked unit must attempt to move off of the battlefield as eficiently as possible. That is, the unit must move the entire length of the movement tool in the direction of the battlefield edge to which that unit is closest. If a unit can move off the
battlefield more eficiently by moving along an indirect path that avoids terrain, the unit should move along that path. After the unit leader is moved, however, any remaining minis in the unit are placed in cohesion as normal. If the unit leader leaves the battlefield, the unit is defeated.

•     If a panicked unit no longer has a number of suppression tokens equal to or greater than double its courage value, that unit is no longer panicked and removes its panic token.

•     A panicked unit cannot perform free actions.

•     A panicked unit that is compelled to move vertically to move off the battlefield must clamber when doing so.

PIERCE X
(WEAPON KEYWORD)	

During the “Modify Defense Dice” step of an attack, a unit whose attack pool includes a weapon that has the pierce x keyword can cancel up to x block (󲉣) results.

•     The pierce x keyword can be used to cancel block (󲉣) results on defense dice rolled by a unit using the guardian x keyword. When doing so, treat canceled block (󲉣) results as blank results. After using pierce x in this way, any unused pierce x value can still be used to cancel block (󲉣) results rolled by the defender.

For example, a unit with pierce 3 attacks an enemy unit, and another enemy unit uses guardian 2 to cancel 2 hit (󲉠) results. After converting surge () results, the unit using guardian has rolled 2 block (󲉣) results. The attacking unit
uses pierce to cancel the 2 block (󲉣) results and the unit using guardian suffers 2 wounds. Now the defender rolls defense dice, and the attacking unit can cancel 1 more block (󲉣) result rolled by the defender since only 2 of its original pierce 3 was used so far.

PIVOT	

Rules ReferenceA pivot is a type of movement that allows a mini with a notched base to change the orientation of its base.

•     When a mini pivots, that mini can rotate its base up to 900 in either direction.

•     To pivot, a player rotates the unit leader’s base around the base’s center point. The center point of the unit leader’s base should remain in place throughout the pivot.

»     If both players reveal a card that has the same number of pips, the player who has the round counter rolls a red defense die. If the result of the roll is a block (󲉣), that player has priority. Otherwise, their opponent has priority.

•     The player with priority resolves their command card first during the Command Phase and takes the first turn during the Activation Phase.

Related Topics: Command Cards, Command Phase, Dice



•     If a notched-base unit contains multiple miniatures, each mini in the unit must pivot so the orientation of its base matches the orientation of the unit leader’s base.

•     A unit can pivot while in dificult terrain without suffering any penalties.

•     If a game effect triggers by a unit moving, that game effect triggers by pivoting.

PRECISE X (UNIT KEYWORD) 

The precise x keyword allows a unit to reroll additional dice when it spends an aim token.

•     During the “Reroll Attack Dice” step of an attack, when a unit that has the precise x keyword spends an aim token, that unit can reroll up to x additional attack dice.

PREMEASURING	

Players can measure with the range ruler at any time. Movement tools can be placed against a unit’s leader and adjusted freely only during that unit’s activation.
Related Topics: Attack, Issuing Orders, Movement, Range
•     Players measure range using the range ruler. The range ruler consists of four segments of equal length. The beginning segment represents range 1, the second segment represents range 2, etc.

»     The beginning of the range ruler has a flat, raised end.

»     Each range segment is an entire plastic section of the ruler.

•     To measure range, a player places the range ruler so its beginning touches part of the base of the mini that range is being measured from. Then, the player points the range ruler toward the mini that range is being measured to; the
measured range is the range that corresponds to the segment closest to the beginning of the ruler that a portion of the base of the mini being measured to is in.

»     If the base of the mini being measured to touches the raised line between two range ruler segments without crossing it, the mini is at the lower range segment that the line separates.

•     Ranges for weapons are presented on cards as icons:



PRIORITY	

Command cards grant players priority based on the number of pips presented in the upper-left corner of the card. Each card has zero to four pips.
»• 󲉬: Range 1

»• 󲉭: Range 2

»• 󲉮: Range 3




•     When players reveal their command cards during the Command Phase, the player whose card has the fewest number of pips has priority.
»• 󲉯: Range 4

»• 󲉰: Beyond range 4

»     The first range presented on a weapon is that weapon’s minimum range; the second range presented on a weapon is that weapon’s maximum range.

Rules Reference••󲉳••••󲉱••󲊅••󲉲»     If only a single range is presented on a weapon, it is both its minimum and maximum range.
RANK	

Units are divided into ranks, identified by the symbol on the upper-right corner their unit card.

•     Each unit is one of the of the following ranks:


»     To use a weapon during an attack, a unit’s target must be	• Commander at a range that is equal to or greater than the weapons’
minimum range and equal to or less than the weapon’s	• Corps maximum range.
• Special Forces •     When a player is measuring using the range ruler, that
player should use a single edge of the range ruler; the player	• Support
should not factor the width or thickness of the ruler.

»     At: A unit is at a range if the portion of a miniature’s base that is closest to the object from which range is being measured is inside the segment that corresponds to that range.

-     If the base of the mini being measured to touches the raised line between two range-ruler segments without crossing it, the mini is at the lower range segment that the line separates.
•     When building a standard army, a player must include certain ranks and may only include specific numbers of certain ranks, as follows:

»•  Commander: Each army must include one to two commander units.

»• 󲉱 Corps: Each army must include three to six corps units.

»     Within: A unit is within a range if the entirety of the miniature’s base is inside the segment that corresponds to that range.

-     A unit can be within a range that extends through multiple segments.

»     Beyond: A unit is beyond a range if no portion of the miniature’s base is between the first segment of the range ruler and the end of the segment that corresponds to the specified range.

READY X (UNIT KEYWORD)	

After a unit with the ready x keyword performs a standby action, that unit gains x aim tokens.

•     This effect is different than performing an aim action, and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim actions are performed.

Related Topics: Abilities, Aim, Attack, Standby
RECOVER	

Rules ReferenceA unit can recover by performing a recover action. When a unit recovers, a player removes all suppression tokens from that unit and readies all of the unit’s exhausted upgrade cards.

•     Unit abilities and other game effects can allow units to recover. If a game effect specifically instructs a unit to recover, that effect is different than performing a recover action and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after recover actions are performed.

Related Topics: Actions, Exhaust, Suppression, Upgrade Cards


RELENTLESS
(UNIT KEYWORD)	

»     Disabled: If the result is a blank, the unit is disabled and gains a disabled token. A unit that is disabled cannot reverse and must spend two actions to perform a standard move.

»     Weapon Destroyed: If the result is a defense surge (), one of the unit’s weapons is destroyed. The player’s opponent places one weapon destroyed token on one of that unit’s weapons. That weapon cannot be used.

•     If a vehicle already has a damaged token, disabled token, or weapon destroyed token, it cannot gain another of these tokens due to suffering wounds, but can gain one through other game effects.

•     Some vehicle units do not have a resilience value. These units have a “–” presented on their unit card where a resilience value would normally be.



After a unit that has the relentless keyword performs a move action, it may perform a free attack action.

»     A vehicle unit without a resilience value cannot be damaged, disabled, or have one of its weapons destroyed.



•     This attack action is a free action and therefore does not count as one of the unit’s two actions.

•     A unit that has already performed an attack action during its activation cannot perform a free attack action.

•     A unit that has already performed a free attack action during its activation cannot perform another attack action.

REVERSE	

Reversing is a type of movement that allows a notched-base mini to move backward.

•     When performing a reverse, a player begins by placing the start of the movement tool into the rear notch of the mini’s base. When finishing a full reverse, a player places the front notch on the mini’s base onto the end of the movement tool. A player can perform a partial reverse with a mini if

•     When performing a reverse, a unit reduces its maximum speed by 1, to a minimum of 1, for that move.




»     Damaged: If the result is a block (󲉣), the unit is damaged and gains a damaged token. When a player activates a damaged unit, they roll a white defense die. If the result is a blank, that vehicle performs one fewer action during its activation.
»     Other effects that reduce a unit’s maximum speed can combine to cause a unit’s maximum speed to be less than 1.

SPEED	

See “Movement” on page 33.


SPEEDER X (UNIT KEYWORD)

The speeder x keyword indicates that a vehicle is constantly in motion, as represented by compulsory moves, while also
indicating the height of terrain the vehicle can freely move over.

•     When a unit that has the speeder x keyword activates, it must perform a compulsory move.

»     A compulsory move is a move, not a move action, and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after move actions are performed and does not count against the unit’s two actions per activation.



The round counter is used to track the current game round.

•     During the End Phase, the player who has the round counter rotates it to display the next highest number; that is the number of the next round. Then,
that player passes the round counter to	Round Counter
their opponent.

•     During the Command Phase, if both players reveal a card that has the same number of pips, the player who has the round counter rolls a red defense die. If the result of the roll is a block (󲉣), that player has priority. Otherwise, their opponent has priority.

Related Topics: Activation Phase, Command Phase, End 
Phase, Priority, Round, Winning the Game, See “Game Round” on page 2.

»     To perform a compulsory move, the unit performs a full move at its maximum speed. If it cannot do so, or if a full move would cause any part of the unit leader’s
base to be outside the battlefield, it can perform a partial move instead, ending its movement as far along the movement template as possible. If the unit performs a partial movement in this way, the unit suffers a number of wounds equal to its maximum speed. If the unit leader ends this movement with any part of its base outside of the battlefield, the unit is defeated.

»     A repulsor vehicle’s final position after performing a move cannot overlap another unit unless it is performing a compulsory move. If it is performing a compulsory move, its final position can overlap trooper minis. If
its final position after performing a compulsory move would overlap one or more trooper minis, those trooper minis are displaced.




SETUP	

See “Setup” on page 6.
•     During a move, a unit that has the speeder x keyword can move over terrain equal to or less than height x.

•     A unit that has the speeder x keyword may end its movement on a piece of terrain that has a height equal to or less than x.



SHARPSHOOTER X
(UNIT KEYWORD)	

During the “Apply Dodge and Cover” step of an attack, a unit with the sharpshooter x keyword subtracts x from the defender’s cover.

Related Topics: Abilities, Compulsory Move, Defeated,
Displacement, Height, Leaving the Battlefield, Movement, Unit 
Leader, Vehicles, See “Additional Terrain Rules” on page 8.


SPEND	




•     When determining cover, add cover values (not exceeding heavy cover), before subtracting cover values.
Game effects often call for units to spend tokens or spend actions.




For example, a unit with heavy cover and a suppression token that is attacked by a unit with sharpshooter 1 has light cover.

Related Topics: Abilities, Attack, Blast (Weapon Keyword),
Cover, Cover X (Unit Keyword), Weapons, See “Additional
40	Terrain Rules” on page 8.
•     When a unit spends a token, the token is returned to the supply.

•     When a unit spends an action, it loses that action. In order to spend more than one action, a unit must be able to perform two consecutive actions, and cannot have lost an action from being suppressed or damaged.
For example, during its “Perform Actions” step, a disabled AT-RT decides to move. Because it is disabled, the AT-RT spends two actions in order to perform the move. Then, with no actions left and with no free actions available, the AT-RT ends its activation.

SPOTTER X (UNIT KEYWORD)

As a card action, a unit with the spotter x keyword can choose up to x friendly units at range 1. Each chosen unit gains one
aim token.

•     This effect is different than performing an aim action, and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim actions are performed.

•     A unit using the spotter x keyword may choose itself as one of the friendly units.
•     During the End Phase, all unspent standby tokens are returned to the supply.

•     A unit must have line of sight to an enemy unit moving, attacking, or performing an action in order to spend a standby token.

•     A standby token may be spent before any effects that trigger after an attack, attack action, move, or move action.

For example, Darth Vader performs a move action to move into range 2 of a unit of Rebel Troopers that have a standby token. Before Vader can trigger relentless to perform
an attack with the “Saber Throw” upgrade card, the Rebel Troopers spend their standby token to perform a move, taking them beyond range 2 of Darth Vader. With no enemy unit in range 1–2, Darth Vader can no longer perform an attack.

»     If a unit is defeated by an enemy unit performing an attack by spending a standby token, the defeated unit cannot then trigger other effects.

SPRAY (WEAPON KEYWORD) 

A weapon that has the spray keyword is effective against units that comprise multiple miniatures. When a mini adds a weapon that has the spray keyword to the attack pool, that weapon contributes its dice a number of times equal to the number of minis in the defender that are in line of sight of the mini using that weapon.

For example, if a weapon has the spray keyword and one black attack die icon, it contributes three black attack dice to the attack pool when targeting a unit that comprises three minis.
For example, a unit of Snowtroopers performs a move and is at range 2 of a unit of Fleet Troopers that have a standby token. The Fleet Troopers spend their standby token
to perform a free attack action. During the attack, the Snowtroopers suffer wounds exceeding their total health and are defeated. Because the Snowtroopers are defeated, they can no longer trigger the steady keyword.

STEADY (UNIT KEYWORD)	

After a unit that has the steady keyword performs a move action, it may perform a free ranged attack action.



Related Topics: Abilities, Attack, Attack Pool, Dice, Line of 
Sight, Miniature, Weapons


STANDBY	

•     This attack action is a free action and therefore does not count as one of the unit’s two actions.

•     A unit that has already performed an attack action during its activation cannot perform a free attack action.



A trooper unit can perform the standby action if it has not performed an attack during its activation. To perform a standby action, a player places a
standby token on the battlefield near the trooper
unit leader that is performing the standby action.	Standby
After an enemy unit attacks, moves, or performs
an action, if that unit is at range 1–2 and in line of sight of a trooper unit with a standby token, that trooper unit may spend that standby token to perform a free attack action or a free move action.

•     A trooper unit cannot perform a standby action if it has performed an attack during its activation.

•     If a trooper unit gains a suppression token or performs a move, an attack, or an action, it discards all standby tokens.

•     A unit cannot have more than one standby token.
•     A unit that has already performed a free attack action during its activation cannot perform another attack action.

Related Topics: Abilities, Actions, Attack, Free Actions, Movement


SUPPRESSION	

Units can gain suppression tokens in various ways. Units with suppression tokens improve their cover but can suffer penalties when they are activated.

•     When a unit gains a suppression token, a player takes a suppression token from the supply and places it on the battlefield next to that unit.
41
•     If a trooper unit has one or more suppression tokens assigned to it, that unit improves its cover by one when defending against ranged attacks.
•     The suppression token gained by suppressive is in addition to any other suppression tokens the defender gains from
Rules Referencethe attack.



•     During the “Rally” step of a unit’s activation, the player who controls that unit rolls one white defense die for each suppression token that unit has. Then, one suppression token is removed from that unit for each block (󲉣) or defense surge () result the roll produces.

»     During the “Perform Actions” step of a trooper unit’s activation, if it has a number of suppression tokens assigned to it that is equal to or greater than its courage value, a player can perform only one action instead of two (plus any number of free actions).

•     If a unit has a number of suppression tokens that is equal to or greater than double its courage value, that unit becomes panicked.

»     If a panicked unit no longer has a number of suppression tokens equal to or greater than double its courage
value, that unit is no longer panicked and removes its panic token.

•     After an attack, if the attack dice produced at least one hit (󲉠) or critical (󲉡) result, the defende suppression token.
•     The effect of suppressive is only applied to an attack pool that includes a weapon with the suppressive keyword. Thus, only the defender that the weapon was used against gains a suppression token.

•     Suppressive is not cumulative; if multiple weapons with the suppressive keyword are included in the same attack pool, the defender still only gains one suppression token.

SURGES

•     Each weapon has one or more ranges at which it can be used.

•     Each weapon depicts a number of colored dice that it can
contribute to an attack pool.	45
•     Many weapons have one or more keywords, which are inherent abilities of a weapon and are presented as part of a weapon on either a unit’s card or an upgrade card.

Rules Reference»     If a weapon has a keyword that changes how the results of the attack roll affects the defender, the entire attack roll affects the defender in that way, not just dice that the weapon that has that keyword contributed.

For example, if a weapon that has the Blast keyword contributed dice to an attack pool, the results from all the dice in that attack pool ignore the defender’s cover.

•     The back of each unit card provides reminder text for each of that unit’s weapon keywords.

»     The reminder text is not an exhaustive description of the rules for a keyword. Rather, it is there to help players remember how and when to resolve each keyword. If a player has questions about how a keyword works, that player should refer to that keyword’s glossary entry.

•     Personnel and heavy weapon upgrades can add trooper minis to a unit. While attacking, these minis can use the weapons of the unit card they are equipped to.
»     If both players have an equal number of victory tokens, the player with the highest score wins. A player’s score is equal to the total point value of each enemy unit that was defeated. This point value includes the point value of the unit and the point values of its equipped upgrades. If this still results in a tie, the Blue Player wins.

•     A unit that is withdrawing cannot perform any other actions, including free actions, or resolve any abilities during its activation. It can only resolve the withdraw.

•     If a game effect triggers by a unit moving, that game effect cannot be triggered by withdrawing.



»     Heavy weapon upgrade cards include the ranges, attack dice, keywords, and other rules specific to the weapon that the Heavy Weapon upgrade card grants to the unit.

•     A panicked unit must withdraw, moving toward the closest edge of the battlefield.



»     While attacking, only the specific mini sculpted with this weapon can use it, though it may choose to use one of the unit’s other weapons instead.

Contact, Engaged, Free Actions, Melee, Movement, Panic, Troopers,



•     Grenade and hardpoint upgrades add another weapon option to a unit. Grenade and hardpoint upgrade cards include the ranges, attack dice, keywords, and other rules specific to the weapon that the upgrade card grants to the unit.

»     While attacking, each mini in a unit that is equipped with a grenade or hardpoint upgrade may use that weapon instead of another weapon on their unit card or equipped upgrade card.

WITHIN (RANGE)	

Within is a term used on cards and in the rulebook when describing range. A unit is within a range if the entirety of the miniature’s base is inside the segment that corresponds to that range.

•     A unit can be within a range that extends through multiple segments.

GRAND ARMY	

Players who wish to play a larger game may construct grand armies instead of standard armies. A grand army follows all the standard rules for army construction, but its total point value is 1,600 instead of 800 and it may include additional units. Additionally, battles between grand armies are conducted on
a 4' x 6' battlefield. During step 5 of setup, do not draw any deployment cards, and during step 6 each player has only one opportunity to eliminate a card. Finally, during step 8, each player should deploy their units within range 2 of a 4’ edge of the battlefield, opposite their opponent.

Version 3.0 LINE OF SIGHT RULES Page 9
BEFORE THE GAME
Define what terrain provides cover by evaluating whether the terrain is taller than 50% of a model DURING EACH ATTACK
1.	Check Line of Sight (LOS) from top center of leader to every point on defending mini (including base)
2.	If obstructed, check imaginary line from center of attacking leader’s base to center of defender base
3.	If line crosses terrain which was defined to provide cover for that type of unit, mini is obstructed… AND THEN
Defending Unit gets the previously defined level of cover.
