# Descent 2e - Rules
## SETUP

Choose a **quest** from the _Quest Guides_ , and assemble the map
as shown in the quest’s _Encounter 1_ diagram, including any
doors. Choose a player to be the **overlord**.

Sort all damage, fatigue, hero, and condition tokens into piles
by type.

Shuffle the **Search cards** into a facedown deck. Sort the
**Condition cards** into piles by type.

Dice in the game: **attack dice** (blue), **power dice** (red and
yellow), and **defense dice** (brown, grey and black).

Rolls are not limited by the number of dice in the game and
players are not limited by the number of tokens in the game.
When more than one player wishes to use an ability with the
same triggering condition, the current player decides the order
in which they are resolved.

When you _exhaust_ a card, rotate it sideways to indicate that
you have used its ability. You cannot use an exhausted card
until it is _refreshed_.

**1. Hero Setup**
Each hero player chooses 1 **Reference card** and takes **hero
tokens** of the corresponding color. All hero players decide who
controls which hero, then each chooses 1 **Hero sheet** and
takes the corresponding figure.

Each hero player chooses 1 **Class deck** matching his chosen
hero’s **archetype icon** (on his Hero sheet). This deck includes
the hero’s starting equipment, as well as all of the skills
associated with that class. You may not select a class that has
been chosen by another player. Any Class deck belonging to a
class not chosen is returned to the box.

Every hero begins the game with the **basic skill** (the skill card
with no experience icon) and starting equipment from his
Class deck. In the basic game, return all other skills to the
box (they are only used if playing a campaign or in Epic Play).

Each player places his hero figure on the map in the area
indicated by the quest rules for hero setup.

**2. Overlord Setup**
The chosen quest lists the monster group options to the
overlord. Take the **Act I** Monster cards and figures for the chosen
monster groups. If a specific **lieutenant** is featured, take the
appropriate **Act I** Lieutenant card and token.

Follow the **setup instructions** for the chosen quest.

Shuffle the 15 basic **Overlord cards** to create the Overlord deck.
In the basic game, return all other Overlord cards to the box
(they are only used if playing a campaign or in Epic Play).

Draw a number of Overlord cards equal to the number of heroes
into your hand.

## ORDER OF PLAY

A game round consists of each player taking one turn, in an
order chosen each round by the players as a group. If players
cannot all agree on an order, proceed clockwise, starting
with the player seated to the left of the overlord. Each player
completes his entire turn before the next player.

After all heroes have completed their turns, the overlord’s turn
begins. After the overlord player finishes his turn, the round
ends and a new round begins.

## HERO TURN

```
During each hero turn , the active hero player performs the
following steps in order:
```
**1. Start of Turn:** Any effects affecting your hero that last _“until
the start of your next turn”_ end.
You may then use any abilities that trigger _“at the start of your
turn”._
Then _refresh_ your _exhausted_ cards (turn them back upright
from their sideways positions).
**2. Equip Items:** If you wish to _equip_ different items, you must
do so during this step. Any excess items are flipped facedown
and may not be used until they are equipped.
**3. Perform Actions:** You receive 2 actions during your turn
which you may perform in any order you choose. You are not
required to perform both actions. An action must usually be
resolved completely before you perform your next action.

```
You may perform any of these actions, and may perform the
same action twice:
```
#### MOVE STAND UP

#### ATTACK SEARCH

#### REST OPEN/CLOSE A D OOR

#### REVIVE A HERO SPECIAL

#### USE A SKILL

**4. Flip Reference Card:** Flip your Reference card facedown to
indicate that your turn is over. Another hero then begins his
turn. When the Reference cards of all the heroes are facedown,
proceed to the overlord turn.

## OVERLORD TURN

```
During each overlord turn , the overlord player performs the
following steps in order:
```
**1. Start of Turn:** Any effects affecting the overlord that last
_“until the start of your next turn”_ end.

```
Then draw 1 Overlord card , and play any number of Overlord
cards that state they may be played “at the start of your turn”.
```
```
Then refresh your exhausted cards.
```
**2. Activate Monsters:** Activate each of your monster groups,
one at a time, once each, in any order you choose. You must
activate all monster groups during your turn, even if the
activated monsters perform no actions.

```
You may perform up to 2 actions with each monster you
activate. Each monster may only perform one attack action
per activation (if a special action allows the monster to attack,
this counts as its one attack for that activation).
```
#### MOVE

#### ATTACK

#### MONSTER ACTION

#### OPEN/CLOSE A D OOR

#### SPECIAL

**3. End of Round:** Each hero flips his Reference card faceup.
The next game round then begins.
**Overlord Cards**
There is no cost to play an Overlord card and no limit to how
many cards the overlord player can play during his turn. Each
card specifies when it may be played. Two Overlord cards
with the same name cannot be played on the same target in
response to the same triggering condition.

```
After resolving an Overlord card, place it faceup in the discard
pile. When the last card is drawn from the Overlord deck,
shuffle the discard pile to create a new deck.
```
## HERO TURN ACTIONS

## MOVEMENT

```
A hero performing a move action receives a number of
movement points (MPs) equal to his Speed.
```
```
Moving into an adjacent space (any space that shares an
edge or corner) usually costs 1 MP. You may choose to move
fewer spaces than your Speed. If you perform 2 move actions
consecutively, you receive MPs equal to twice your Speed.
```
```
You cannot move into or through spaces containing figures
or obstacles ( blocked spaces). You may move diagonally
(including around corners and between blocked spaces) and
through friendly figures (a hero treats all other heroes as
friendly figures), but you cannot end your movement in the
same space as another figure.
```
```
You may interrupt your movement to perform another action,
and then continue the rest of your movement.
```
```
You may suffer fatigue to receive additional MPs during your
turn: for each fatigue suffered, you receive 1 MP. You may not
do this if you already have fatigue equal to your Stamina. You
do not have to perform a move action in order to suffer fatigue
to move. During your turn, before or after resolving an action
or during a move action, you may suffer fatigue to gain MPs.
```
```
Monsters follow the same rules as heroes when moving
except they cannot suffer fatigue to receive additional MPs.
A monster treats all other monsters as friendly figures.
```
```
Normally figures cannot move through the walls along the
edge of a tile, but some quests allow movement off the map
by moving to an edge space and spending 1 MP.
Trading Items
Your hero may trade any number of Shop Item cards, Relic
cards, and Search cards with an adjacent hero at any point
during a move action. You do not have to receive a card in
return. You can still only equip any cards you receive at the
start of your next turn. You cannot trade Class cards (including
starting equipment).
```
## ATTACK

```
A hero performing an attack action may use one of his
equipped weapons to attack a space containing a monster.
```
```
A weapon with the Melee icon may only target a space
adjacent to the attacker. A weapon with the Ranged icon may
target any space in line of sight (LOS) of the attacker.
```
```
Monsters follow the same rules, except that the type of attack
is listed on its card (along with the dice used).
```
```
Perform combat by resolving the following steps in order:
```
**1. Declare Weapon and Target
2. Roll Dice
3. Check Range
4. Spend Surges
5. Deal Damage**.

## USE A SKILL

```
A hero performing a use a skill action may use a skill that
has a listed on his Class card. If the skill allows you to
perform an attack, the normal rules for performing an attack
action apply.
```
```
If a skill shows a fatigue cost , suffer this amount of fatigue
in order to perform the listed or trigger an ability that
requires the player to “exhaust this card”, or “use this card’.
```
```
You cannot suffer fatigue that would exceed your Stamina.
If the skill would cause you to do so, or if you have already
suffered fatigue equal to your Stamina, you cannot use the
skill until you recover enough fatigue.
```
## REST

```
A hero performing a rest action recovers all fatigue at the
end of his turn.
```
```
As a reminder, place a hero token on your Reference card.
At the end of your turn, after you flip your Reference card,
discard the hero token and all fatigue from your Hero sheet.
```
## SEARCH

```
A hero adjacent to or in a space that contains a search token
may perform a search action to search that space. Flip the
token faceup and discard it. If the token is not unique, draw
a Search card.
```
```
Some quests use the unique search token to represent items
unique to that quest. Do not draw a Search card if the unique
search token is revealed: instead, refer to the Quest Guide.
```
```
Some Search cards may be used for a one-time effect. After
using a Search card, flip the card facedown and keep it in
your play area.
```
## STAND UP

```
A knocked out hero can only perform a stand up action. This
action may only be performed by a hero that is knocked out.
```
```
To stand up, roll 2 red power dice , recover damage equal to
the rolled, recover fatigue equal to the rolled, replace
your hero token with your hero figure, and flip your Reference
card facedown to indicate your turn is over (you may not
perform an additional action).
If another figure occupies the space with the hero token, the
standing hero figure is placed in the closest empty space to
his hero token of that hero player’s choice.
```
## REVIVE A HERO

```
A hero performing a revive a hero action may revive a knocked
out hero whose hero token is in an adjacent space. The
knocked out hero rolls 2 red power dice , recovers damage
equal to the rolled, recovers fatigue equal to the rolled,
and replaces his hero token with his figure.
```
```
If another figure occupies the space with the hero token, he
places his figure in the closest empty space to his hero token
of that hero player’s choice.
```
## OPEN OR CLOSE A D OOR

```
A hero or monster who perform an open or close a door action
may open or close one adjacent door. Some doors are locked
or sealed: refer to the Quest Guide for instructions.
```
```
When a door is opened, remove it from the map and set it
nearby. If it is later closed, return the door to its original
location. Figures cannot move or trace LOS through doors.
Spaces separated by a door are not considered adjacent.
```
## SPECIAL

```
During quests and campaigns, heroes may acquire Search
cards , Shop Item cards , or Relic cards that contain actions
denoted with a. These actions may be performed in the
same way as using a skill on a Class card. Some heroic feats
are also denoted with a and require an action to perform.
Certain quest rules also provide quest-specific actions that
may be performed by the heroes.
```
## HEROIC F EATS

```
Each hero player has a heroic feat listed on his Hero sheet.
Those marked with a require an action to perform. A heroic
feat can only be performed once per encounter; flip the Hero
sheet facedown to indicate it has been used. At the start of
the next encounter, flip the sheet so that the heroic feat is
available again.
```

## ATTRIBUTE TESTS

Heroes and lieutenants have 4 attributes:

**Might** ,
**Knowledge**

**Willpower**^
**Awareness**
To pass an attribute test, roll **1 gray defense die and 1 black
defense die** and roll a number of equal to or less than your
hero’s attribute. Otherwise, you fail the test.

A minion or master monster required to make an attribute test
automatically fails. Cards or abilities that reference defense
dice do not apply to attribute tests unless noted.

## EQUIPMENT

A hero can carry any number of Shop Item, Class, and Search
cards, but cannot **equip** more than 2 **hand** icons in total, one
item with an **armor** icon, and up to 2 items with **other** icons.

Items not equipped are flipped facedown or placed under your
Hero sheet. Shop Item or Class cards can only be used when
equipped.

Cards without at least one of these icons can be equipped
without restriction, and remain faceup near your Hero sheet to
be used as specified on the card.

## COMBAT

## 1. DECLARE WEAPON AND TARGET

The attacker declares which **space** in his LOS he is attacking;
this space must contain one enemy figure as the target. _Melee_
attacks can only target an adjacent space. _Ranged_ attacks
may target any figure in LOS (including adjacent spaces).

The attacker then declares which equipped weapon he is
using—either 1 equipped weapon or his bare hands. **A bare
hands attack can only target an adjacent space and only the
blue attack die is rolled**.

Only abilities on the chosen weapon may be used; ignore
abilities on another equipped weapon. To make a _Ranged_
attack, you must choose an equipped _Ranged_ weapon.

Monsters cannot equip weapons; dice rolled for the monster’s
attack, and the attack type, are listed on its card.

**Line of Sight (LOS)** To have LOS to a space, you must trace
an uninterrupted, straight line from any corner of your figure’s
space to any corner of the target space. If the line passes
through the edge of a map tile, a door, or a blocked space (a
space containing a figure or obstacle), the target space is not
in LOS.

If the line passes along the edge of a blocked space, the target
space is not in LOS. If the line only touches the corner of a
blocked space (without passing through the space itself), the
target space is in LOS. A space adjacent to a figure is in LOS.

## 2. ROLL DICE

Creates your **attack pool** by gathering all the dice listed on
your equipped weapon or monster card, and rolling them for
your **attack roll**. If an ability allows you to add dice to this
pool, do so before the roll.

An **X** rolled on the blue attack die means the attack is a miss
and all other results are ignored. Otherwise add up all
results to determine the attack’s damage.

If you control a figure affected by the attack, create your
**defense pool** by gathering all the defense dice listed on your
Hero sheet (plus any provided by equipment and card effects)
or monster card and rolling them for your **defense roll**. If an
ability allows you to add dice to this pool, do so before the roll.

```
Add up all of the results to determine how much damage is
canceled on this attack. If multiple figures are affected, each
affected figure rolls its defense pool separately.
```
```
After all attack and defense dice have been rolled, players
may use any abilities that allow them to reroll dice. Cards
and abilities that specifically refer to defense dice apply only
to defense dice rolled as part of an attack (unless stated
otherwise).
```
## 3. CHECK R ANGE

```
On a Ranged attack, count the spaces to the target space,
starting with an adjacent space of your choice. The numbers
rolled on the dice are the maximum range of the attack. If
the total range from the attack roll does not equal or exceed
the distance, the attack is a miss unless the range can be
increased.
```
```
When counting spaces for attacks and abilities, ignore any
non-obstacle terrain in those spaces. If an ability affects
figures within a specified number of spaces, LOS is not
needed unless noted. When counting spaces for an ability, you
cannot count spaces through a door because the spaces are
not considered adjacent.
```
## 4. SPEND SURGES

```
Any surge results ( ) obtained during the attack roll may
be spent by the attacker on surge abilities. Weapons, skills,
hero abilities, and items may all have surge abilities, and an
attacking monster can spend surges to trigger certain abilities
listed on its monster card.
```
```
Each individual rolled may be spent once, and each surge
ability may only be triggered once per attack. If the attacker
has access to 2 different surge abilities with identical effects,
he can trigger both effects if has enough results.
Up to 1 unused may be used by an attacking hero to
recover 1 fatigue. Monsters cannot do this.
Surge abilities may only be triggered during attacks unless
otherwise specified.
```
## 5. DEAL DAMAGE

```
The defender adds up all the results in his defense pool.
Each result cancels one damage ( ) from the attack
(ignore any excess ). Any damage not canceled by a is
suffered by the defender.
```
```
Tracks damage by placing damage tokens on the Hero sheet
(heroes) or near the monster figure (overlord). If damage ever
equals or exceeds the figure’s Health, the figure is defeated.
Defense dice are used to cancel damage only during an
attack, not damage caused by an ability.
```
## ATTACK KEYWORDS

```
Blast
All spaces adjacent to the targeted space are also affected by
the attack. Roll the attack pool once and apply the result to
each affected figure; each rolls its defense pool separately.
Only the target space needs to be in range and in LOS of the
attacker. Blast attacks affect both enemy and friendly figures,
and a figure can only be affected by Blast once per attack.
```
```
Pierce
The attack ignores a number of results generated by the
defending player (from their defense roll or other abilities)
equal to the rating of Pierce. Pierce from multiple sources are
added together.
Reach
Allows the figure to use a melee attack to target a figure up to
2 spaces away, rather than only adjacent spaces. The target
still needs to be in LOS.
```
## DAMAGE AND HEALTH

```
When a hero suffers damage, take the cost in damage tokens
and place them on his Hero sheet. When a hero or monster
suffers damage ( ) equal to its Health , it is immediately
defeated. A defeated monster is removed from the map and
from play. A defeated hero is knocked out. If a hero is defeated
at any point during his own turn, his turn immediately ends.
```
```
Knocked Out
When your hero is defeated, he immediately suffers fatigue up
to his Stamina, and damage up to his Health (if defeated by
some other effect).
Remove his figure from the map and replace it with one of
your hero tokens. Discard any Condition cards you have. The
overlord player may immediately draw 1 Overlord card.
```
```
A hero cannot use skills or abilities while knocked out, unless
an effect allows it. He cannot receive any Condition cards and
is immune to all attacks and most hero abilities.
```
```
Heroes cannot suffer fatigue past their Stamina value, nor
damage past their Health value—even when knocked out.
```
```
A knocked out hero may still recover damage from other
heroes through the use of skills, potions, and being revived. If
he recovers at least one damage, he immediately replaces his
hero token with his figure and may perform actions as normal
on his next turn.
```
```
A space containing a hero token is considered empty to other
figures for the purposes of movement, and knocked out heroes
do not block LOS.
```
```
Unless revived by another hero, a knocked out hero may only
perform one action on his next turn—to stand up.
```
```
While monster attacks cannot target or affect a knocked out
hero, hero players may only target a knocked out hero with
an ability that would allow the knocked out hero to recover
any amount of damage. For this exception, the hero token is
treated as a hero even if another figure occupies the space
containing the hero token.
```
## FATIGUE AND STAMINA

```
Your hero may voluntarily suffer fatigue ( ) to use skills or
move additional spaces, but only up to an amount equal to
your Stamina. Place the cost in fatigue tokens on your Hero
sheet. A hero forced to suffer fatigue in excess of his Stamina
instead suffers damage equal to the excess fatigue.
```
```
If a monster suffers any amount of fatigue, it suffers that
amount of damage instead.
```
## CONDITIONS

```
Some abilities and effects may inflict conditions, and some
attacks have a ability featuring a condition. If the attack
deals at least 1 (after rolling defense dice), the target
suffers the listed condition.
```
```
A hero affected by a condition places the corresponding
card near his sheet. A monster affected by a condition has a
condition token placed next to it. A figure cannot be affected
by the same condition more than once at any given time.
```
## OBJECTIVE TOKENS

```
Figures may pick up objective tokens by performing a special
action adjacent to or in the same space as the token. The
token is then placed on either the Hero sheet or on the
monster figure’s base. While a figure is carrying an objective
token, no other figure can pick it up.
```
```
A figure can drop an objective token in an adjacent space by
performing an action. When a figure carrying an objective is
defeated, place the token in that figure’s space; it may now be
picked up by another figure.
```
## MONSTERS

```
Monsters are placed and activated in groups of a size
determined by the number of heroes in the game. All those of
a given type are part of the same monster group, which can
contain minion and master varieties. An effect that affects a
monster group affects each monster within it. Unless playing
a campaign or Epic Play, always use Act I Monster cards.
```
```
Large monsters occupy more than one space. When they
move, choose one of the spaces the monster occupies and
count movement from that space as if the figure occupied one
space. When it ends/interrupts its movement, place it so one
of the spaces its base occupies includes the space where it
ended its movement. You may change its base’s orientation,
but if the monster cannot fit its entire base on the map, it
cannot end/interrupt its movement in that space. It is only
considered to have entered the one space in which it ended
its movement. When interrupting a monster’s movement to
perform an action, the overlord must be able to declare the
action it will perform before placing the figure.
```
```
Large monsters entering a space containing terrain are
affected as normal. When they end their move with their bases
on terrain they did not move through, check for terrain effects.
```
```
Lieutenants are controlled by the overlord player. They are
represented by lieutenant tokens, but are treated as monster
figures for all purposes, unless specified otherwise. Each
lieutenant is treated as its own monster group.
```
## FAMILIARS

```
Familiars are represented by a token and cannot usually be
targeted or affected by any attack. Your hero may activate
each familiar he controls once during your turn (before or after
resolving all of your actions). This does not require an action,
but it may not interrupt any other action.
```
```
An activated familiar may perform a move action. A familiar
treats any special terrain (other than obstacles) as water during
its movement, and may perform additional actions during
its activation, if noted on its card. These may usually be
performed in addition to the move action and may interrupt it.
```
```
A familiar does not normally block LOS or movement, unless
otherwise noted. Any figure may end its movement in its
space, and it may end its movement in a space with a figure.
```
```
Some familiars block LOS and movement, and are treated
as friendly figures for hero movement. They may be targeted
and affected by monster attacks, hero abilities, and Overlord
cards that target a hero. If they need to make an attribute
test, they automatically fail. These familiars are susceptible
to the effects of terrain and may be affected by conditions.
```
## TERR AIN

```
Obstacles (red line) block movement and LOS.
Water (blue line) costs 2 MPs to enter. A large monster ending
its movement adjacent to a water space may place its base in
the water spaces without suffering any movement penalty.
```
```
Pit Each time a figure enters a pit space (green line) it suffers
2. A figure in a pit cannot spend MPs, though other effects
that move it without spending MPs can be used to exit a pit.
A figure in a pit only has LOS to adjacent figures, and vice
versa. As an action, the figure may be placed it in an adjacent
empty space if there is one. Large monsters suffer the effects
of pit spaces only if their movement ends or is interrupted so
that each space they occupy is a pit space.
```
```
Lava A figure entering a lava space (yellow line) suffers
1 damage. Any figure that ends its turn in a lava space is
immediately defeated. Defeated heroes place their hero token
in the nearest empty space that does not contain lava. A large
monster is defeated only if all spaces it occupies are lava.
```

## TWO-PLAYER GAMES

The hero player controls 2 heroes, each of which takes his
turn independently and is treated as if he is an individual
hero controlled by a different player.

**Once during each hero’s turn, that hero may perform 1
regular attack that does not require an action** (not a special
action that includes an attack). This attack can only be
performed during the _Perform Actions_ step of the hero turn,
before or after either of the hero’s actions.

**At the end of each hero’s turn, if that hero did not or could not
perform the free attack that turn, he may instead recover 2**.

## EPIC PLAY

All players agree upon a **power level** after choosing a quest.
When choosing Shop Item cards, heroes may share gold.

**Basic Level:** Follow normal setup.

**Advanced Level:** Each hero receives 3 XPs worth of Class
cards and 150 gold worth of Act I Shop Item cards of their
choice. The overlord receives 4 XPs worth of Overlord cards.

**Expert Level:** Each hero receives 6 XPs worth of Class cards
and 250 gold worth of Act I or Act II Shop Item cards of their
choice. The overlord receives 8 XPs worth of Overlord cards.
The overlord uses his Act II Monster and Lieutenant cards.

## QUESTS

Quests in the _Quest Guides_ may be played individually, each
in a single game session, except for the _Interlude_ and _Finale_
quests, which can only be played as part of the campaign.
A quest usually consists of 2 encounters, each with its own
map layout, rules, and objectives.

When one side completes its objective, the quest
immediately ends if it is Encounter 2, or transitions from
Encounter 1 to Encounter 2 by following these steps:

Heroes keep all damage and conditions they had at the
end of Encounter 1, and recover all fatigue they suffered.

Each hero player flips his Hero sheet faceup and keeps all
his search cards (any flipped cards remain flipped). Any
knocked out heroes may perform a free stand up action.

The overlord keeps his current hand of Overlord cards.

Set up the Encounter 2 map.

The last encounter of a quest ends when one side meets the
victory condition.

_Quest Guide_ rules take precedence over the main rules, and
cards and abilities take precedence over all rules.

## CAMPAIGN RULES

## STARTING A NEW CAMPAIGN

Determining which player is the overlord and the other
players’ heroes (and their hero classes) is only performed at
the start of the campaign and is permanent for the campaign.

**New campaigns begin at Basic Level**. The heroes have only
the basic skill and starting equipment for their class, and
the overlord has only his basic Overlord deck. Heroes do not
return their Class deck to the box after choosing their skills,
but keep their Class deck facedown in their play area.

```
Separate the Shop Item, Monster, and Lieutenant cards into
their Act I and Act II piles. Act II cards are not used until the
campaign moves into Act II.
```
## THE CAMPAIGN PHASE

```
Most quests have 2 encounters, and the Campaign phase
does not take place until the entire quest is finished. Perform
the following steps during each Campaign phase:
```
**1. Receive Gold from Search Cards:** Record the total gold
value of every Search card acquired during the quest on the
Campaign sheet (even if the card was used during the quest).
Then return all Search cards to the deck (even if the heroes
didn’t use their abilities).
**2. Cleanup:** All heroes recover all damage and all fatigue.
The overlord combines his draw and discard piles. All
Condition cards are discarded, all effects end, the map is
disassembled, and the quest is cleaned up.
**3. Receive Rewards:** The overlord player and hero players
each receive 1 **experience point** (XP), regardless of who won
the quest. Record this on the Campaign sheet. The winner of
the quest receives additional rewards as noted in the quest.
**4. Shopping:** Hero players may spend any gold they have
acquired to purchase new Shop Item cards.
**5. Spend Experience Points:** Players may spend any XPs they
have earned. XPs are spent on new skills for heroes and new
Overlord cards for the overlord.
**6. Choose Next Quest:** The winner of the quest chooses
which quest will be played next.
**7. Set Up Quest:** Set up the next quest. The overlord player
shuffles his Overlord deck, including any new cards just
purchased. He then draws his starting hand.
**8. Travel:** Heroes travel to the next quest location.

## SPEND EXPERIENCE POINTS

```
A hero may spend XPs to purchase new hero skills from his
own Class deck.
```
```
Your first skill from the deck, your basic class skill, is always
free. Other skills have their XP cost listed on the experience
icon in the upper right. Place the purchased card next to
your Hero sheet and record the XPs spent on the Campaign
sheet. You can then use that skill in all future quests during
the campaign.
```
```
XPs may be saved to purchase more expensive skills during
a future Campaign phase. You may purchase any number of
skills if you have enough XPs.
```
```
The overlord may spend XPs to purchase new cards for his
Overlord deck. Add the purchased card to your deck and
record the XPs spent on the Campaign sheet.
```
```
Upgraded Overlord cards come in Warlord , Saboteur , and
Magus classes, each with 3 levels: level 1 cards cost 1 XP,
level 2 cards cost 2 XPs, and level 3 cards cost 3 XPs.
```
```
Level 1 cards (including Universal cards) are always available
to purchase. To purchase a level 2 card, you must already
have 2 level 1 cards of that class in your deck. To purchase a
level 3 card, you must already have 3 level 1 or level 2 cards
of that class in your deck. You may purchase cards from
multiple classes.
XPs may be saved to purchase Overlord cards during a future
Campaign phase. You may purchase any number of Overlord
cards if you have enough XPs.
Before each quest (but not each encounter), the overlord
player may choose to secretly set aside a number of cards
from his deck to optimize his strategy. You must keep a deck
of at least 15 Overlord cards for each quest. After the quest
ends, return any removed cards to your deck.
```
## SHOPPING

```
Heroes share their gold in a collective pool, and may
distribute purchased equipment however they wish. Gold may
be saved to purchase items during a future Campaign phase.
After each quest, shuffle the Shop Item cards (Act I or Act II
cards, depending on the current Act) and reveal 5 cards.
```
```
Hero players may purchase as many of these items as desired
and can afford (or none at all), subtracting the gold spent
from the Campaign sheet. Shuffle unpurchased Shop Item
cards back into the Shop Item deck.
```
```
Heroes may sell Shop Item cards back to the shop when
shopping, receiving half the value in gold, rounding down to
the closest multiple of 25 gold. Starting equipment may be
sold back for the price of 25 gold each.
```
```
Shuffle a sold back Shop Item card into its corresponding
Shop Item card deck. Sold Starting equipment is returned to
the box. Relics cannot be sold back to the shop.
```
```
During the Campaign phase, any time until the next quest
begins (except during travel), heroes may freely exchange
their Shop Item cards among themselves. Heroes cannot
trade starting equipment.
```
## CHOOSE NEXT QUEST

```
Quests are divided into Act I and Act II quests; players must
choose a quest from the current Act. A single campaign
consists of 9 quests:
```
```
Introduction
3 Act I quests
Interlude
3 Act II quests
Finale
```
```
When the 2 encounters of a quest are completed, perform
a Campaign phase, then choose the next quest. As players
complete quests, mark who won each quest on the quest log
side of the Campaign sheet.
```
```
If the heroes won a particular Act I quest, the corresponding
Act II quest on the left side is available. If the overlord won
a particular Act I quest, the corresponding Act II quest on
the right side is available. If the heroes did not attempt a
particular Act 1 quest, it is considered to have been won by
the overlord.
```
```
The Interlude and Finale quests are determined by how many
quests the heroes and overlord win during Act I and Act II.
```
```
Between sessions, use bags to keep components organized.
```
## TR AVEL

```
Heroes must travel to new locations to undertake quests. Use
the campaign map in the Quest Guide. After choosing and
setting up the next quest, players perform the travel step.
```
```
Heroes always begin the travel step at Arhynn and must
follow a continuous path to the chosen quest location shown
on the map. After completing a quest, the heroes travel back
to Arhynn, but no travel step is necessary.
The overlord player may customize his deck, and draws his
starting hand of Overlord cards (one card per hero), before
the Travel step.
```
```
These cards are not played during the travel step, but may be
affected by certain events. Note these cards are his starting
hand for the upcoming quest, so he does not draw any
additional cards at the beginning of the quest.
```
```
Heroes must stop at each travel icon along the paths
connecting quest locations. Each time they stop at an icon
```
```
on their way to a location, the overlord player draws 1 Travel
Event card and checks the matching event icon.
```
```
If the matching event icon has no event the card is
discarded, and the heroes continue. If an event is listed, the
heroes must resolve the event before continuing. All hero
players must agree when making any choices listed on the
card. Any damage, fatigue, or condition the heroes suffer
from events is carried over to the quest.
```
## RELICS

```
Relics follow the normal rules for items, but they are not
Shop Items and may never be purchased or sold.
```
```
If the heroes have a relic, it is placed with its hero side
faceup and functions just like a Shop Item card.
```
```
If the overlord has the relic, it is placed with its overlord side
faceup, and may be wielded by any lieutenant (this is the
only way the relic’s abilities can be used by the overlord).
Each lieutenant can wield only 1 relic.
```
```
During the setup step of each quest, the overlord chooses
which relic (if any) each of his lieutenants wields during the
quest. Place the chosen Relic next to the Lieutenant card.
```
```
If the relic is not wielded by a lieutenant, the overlord keeps
the card near his Overlord deck and its abilities are ignored
during this quest. If a lieutenant wielding a relic is defeated
during a quest, the relic’s abilities are ignored for the
remainder of the quest but the overlord keeps it.
```
## INTERLUDE

```
The Interlude is a quest that marks the transition from Act I
to Act II of the campaign, and is considered an Act I quest.
```
```
After completing 3 Act I quests, the Interlude must be
chosen as the next quest. Some Interludes have only one
encounter, rather than the typical 2 encounters.
```
## ACT II

```
After completing the Interlude , players choose quests from
among the Act II options. Follow these steps:
```
**1.** Perform steps 1-3 of the Campaign phase.
**2.** Instead of performing a normal shopping step, deal out all
    remaining **Act I Shop Item cards** faceup. The hero players
    may purchase any number of Act I Shop Item cards.
**3.** Return all unpurchased **Act I Shop Item, Monster,**
    **Lieutenant cards** to the box. Retrieve the **Act II Shop**
    **Item, Monster, and Lieutenant cards** from the box.
    From now on, all monsters and lieutenants use their Act
    II characteristics. Act I Shop Item cards currently in
    possession of the heroes are unaffected. Return any Act I
    Shop Item card sold by the heroes during Act II to the box.
**4.** Perform steps 5-8 of the Campaign phase.

```
After completing 3 Act II quests, players resolve 1 Campaign
phase as normal and then the heroes travel to the Finale
quest to determine the winner of the campaign.
```
## F INALE

```
The Finale is played after completing 3 Act II quests.
```
```
Pay special attention to the setup instructions as they may
refer to previous quests and various game states that are an
extension of the overall campaign.
```
```
Any Act II quest that the heroes did not attempt is assumed
to have ended in an overlord victory for the purposes of
determining the setup of the Finale quest.
```
```
Heroes and overlord alike should spend as much gold and as
many XPs as they can during the Campaign phase before the
Finale. Whoever wins the Finale wins the whole campaign.
```

## LAIR OF THE WYRM

## SETUP

These rules assume players start a new campaign. When
playing a single rumor quest outside of a campaign, The
_Rewards_ section of each quest is ignored. When using this
expansion while playing a Basic or Epic Play game, all of
these rules are used except for Rumor cards.

Add all **Shop Item** and **Travel Event** cards to their respective
decks. Replace the _Nothing_ card in the **Search** deck with
the _Secret Passage_ Search card; then shuffle the deck.
Ensure there is only one copy of _Secret Passage_ in the deck
(if playing with other expansions). Shuffle the **Secret Room**
cards and place them facedown near the Search deck.

Add the new **Class** , **Condition** , **Relic** , **Overlord** , **Monster** , and
**Lieutenant** cards to the pool of available cards.

The one _Rumor Reward_ Overlord card cannot be purchased
normally. The overlord can only receive this card as a quest
reward, when he shuffles it into his Overlord deck as normal.

Set the **Advanced Quest** cards aside. Place the shuffled
**Rumor** cards facedown near the Overlord deck. The overlord
draws 3 cards from this deck when a new campaign starts.

Add the **Hero sheets** , hero and monster figures, all tokens,
and map tiles to their respective supplies.

## QUESTS

Each of the 5 Quests have 1 or 2 Encounters, and they are
incorporated into campaigns through the use of **Rumor** and
**Advanced Quest** cards.

## INACTIVE MONSTERS

When a monster group is specified
as **inactive** , the overlord places
an **inactive monster token** on
its Monster card; all figures
corresponding to that monster group
are inactive. The overlord cannot activate inactive monsters
or affect them using Overlord cards unless specifically stated
in the quest.

Inactive monster figures on the map block LOS and
movement, and may still be targeted and affected by attacks
from other figures—roll defense dice as normal.

Unless otherwise noted, if an inactive monster suffers any
amount of (for any reason), discard the corresponding
inactive monster token; that monster group is no longer
inactive and the overlord player may activate them as normal
on his turn.

## HERO CLASSES

The **Champion** and the **Geomancer** classes belong to the
Warrior and Mage archetypes, respectively. Hero players may
choose these classes during setup.

## OVERLORD CARDS

The Overlord cards include 7 new cards of the **Punisher**
Overlord class. The one _Rumor Reward_ card does not have
an experience cost and cannot be purchased normally; it can
only be received as a quest reward, when it is shuffled it into
the Overlord deck as normal.

## CONDITION (BURNING)

```
Condition cards and tokens for the Burning
condition are added to the existing supply of
Condition cards and tokens.
```
## VALOR TOKENS

```
If you choose the Champion class during Hero
Setup, take the supply of valor tokens. Place one
on your Hero sheet each time you are instructed
to gain 1 valor token. Each time you spend a valor
token (usually to trigger an effect from one of your skills),
return the token from your Hero sheet to the supply.
Valor tokens remain on Hero sheets between encounters but
are discarded at the end of a quest. Valor tokens are limited
to the available supply.
```
## SUMMONED STONE FAMILIARS

```
The Geomancer may summon and control
Summoned Stone familiars. These follow all rules
for familiars with exceptions described on the
Summoned Stone Familiar card. You may have
multiple Summoned Stones on the map; each is activated
independently and shares the characteristics and abilities
described on the card.
You may remove one or more Summoned Stone familiar
tokens from the map anytime during your turn. If you use an
ability to summon one while you are at your limit (initially
one), first discard one from play. A defeated Summoned
Stone is removed from the map.
```
## SECRET ROOMS

```
Heroes are not required to explore a secret room to complete
the quest. They cannot explore a secret room if there is
already a secret room card in play.
```
```
When you draw the Secret Passage Search card,
place a secret room entrance token in your space.
```
```
If the card is drawn when the heroes are not on the map,
draw a replacement Search card and shuffle the card back
into the Search deck.
```
```
A hero in the same space as a secret room entrance token
may spend 1 MP to explore. Draw and resolve 1 Secret Room
card. If the card instructs you to place a secret room tile:
```
**1. Place Secret Room:** Place the appropriate secret room tile
    near (not connected) to the map. The tile code on the tile
    must match the tile code on the Secret Room card.
**2. Move Hero:** Place your hero figure on the secret room tile’s
    **entrance space** (with the secret room entrance icon).
**3. Place Challenge Tokens:** The overlord randomly draws
    challenge tokens equal to the number of heroes and,
    without looking at them, places each facedown in a corner
    on the tile as follows, only one challenge token per space.

## 2

## 2

## 3

## 4

```
During your turn, if your hero figure is
in a secret room entrance space, you may
spend 1 MP to move to any other secret
room entrance space as if they were
adjacent. Monsters cannot use secret
room entrances.
```
```
If you move your figure to an occupied secret room entrance
space, place it in the closest available empty space of choice.
```
```
Challenge tokens
When your hero is adjacent to or in a space containing a
facedown challenge token, you may perform a search action
to flip the token faceup (do not draw a Search card). The face
of each token displays either a monster or an attribute icon.
```
```
If the revealed token displays a monster , place it in the
closest available empty space from where it was revealed and
treat it as a minion monster figure of the indicated type. It
does not count against the overlord’s monster group limits,
and uses its corresponding Monster card of the current Act.
If the monster belongs to a monster group that is currently
inactive, the challenge token is immediately discarded.
If the revealed token displays an attribute icon , the hero must
immediately test that attribute. If he passes, immediately
draw a Search card and discard the challenge token. If he
fails, still discard the token but do not draw a Search card.
```
```
At the start of each overlord turn in which there is a hero on
a secret room tile, the overlord may discard one challenge
token or monster figure from the secret room tile. Choose
before the overlord draws his Overlord card. The discarded
token is not revealed.
```
```
Secret room rewards
As soon as there are zero challenge tokens and zero monster
figures on the secret room tile, the player taking his turn
resolves any Reward effects on the Secret Room card. If
multiple hero figures are on the tile, the heroes choose one of
them to resolve the reward effect.
Then, players remove all heroes from the secret room tile
and place them in empty spaces nearest to the secret room
entrance token and the secret room tile and entrance token
are discarded. The player whose turn was paused resumes
his turn.
```
```
Knocked out in a secret room
If a hero is knocked out while in a secret room, all normal
rules for being knocked out are followed, except the player
places his hero token in the secret entrance token’s space,
even if that space is not empty.
```
```
Refreshing the Secret Room deck
At the end of each encounter, discard all Secret Room cards
in play that have not been claimed as rewards. At the end
of each quest, shuffle all discarded Secret Room cards back
into the Secret Room deck.
```
## RUMORS

```
The overlord can play a maximum of 1 Rumor card from his
hand, at a time stated on the card, during each Campaign
phase. The hero players immediately resolve the card’s text
before continuing the Campaign phase.
```
```
At the start of Act II, the overlord must discard any Rumor
cards that can only be played in Act I. He does not draw
replacements. Discards are not shuffled back into the Rumor
deck, and if the deck runs out of cards, it is not reshuffled.
If the overlord must draw a Rumor card and there are no
cards in the deck, he does not draw one.
```
## QUEST CARDS

```
Quest cards are both Advanced Quests cards and Rumor
cards that feature quests ( Rumor Quest cards). They are
quests that players can choose during the Choose Next Quest
step of a Campaign phase.
```
```
When they enter play, they are placed faceup on the table
and become available quests.
```
```
Rumor Quest cards are played by the overlord as instructed.
Advanced Quest cards only enter play when instructed by a
game effect, eg. the Reward section of the Quest Guide.
```
```
Each time a player (overlord or hero) would choose a quest
during the Choose Next Quest step of the Campaign phase,
he can choose any available quest : either a quest on the
campaign sheet or a Quest card on the table.
```
```
When you choose the latter, immediately begin quest setup
as normal, referring to the corresponding quest in the Quest
Guide.
```
```
Before attempting these quests, perform the Travel step of
the Campaign phase as normal, but instead of referencing
the quest map, refer to the travel icons at the top of the
appropriate Quest card. These icons are resolved from left to
right as if they were on the path leading to the quest.
```
```
Quest cards remain in play until completed or discarded by
a game effect. They are not automatically discarded at the
start of the Campaign phase, and can persist from session to
session until completed.
Between sessions, store any available Quest cards as a
reminder that the quest has not been attempted yet. After
either the heroes or the overlord wins a quest, the victor may
store the card with the rest of his materials as a reminder
that he won that quest.
```
```
Act Specific Quest Cards
Some Quest cards have the Act I or Act II icon in the upper
left hand corner, and can only be attempted during the
corresponding act.
```
```
If one or more Act I Quest cards are still in play immediately
before playing the Interlude, the heroes must choose one of
them to attempt before proceeding to the Interlude. After
completing this quest, all other available Act I Quest cards
are discarded from the game without effect.
Completing a Quest card
The Quest Guide lists all rewards for winning each quest.
Perform the Campaign phase as normal after completing a
Quest card.
```
```
Any quest attempted as a result of a Quest card does not
count against the number of quests required to complete for
the current Act. Quest cards are always played in addition to
the required number of campaign quests in a particular Act.
Also, players do not have to attempt any Quest cards in order
to complete the campaign, and may ignore all quests from
Quest cards when determining how many quests are won by
the overlord or the heroes during any given Act.
```
```
Advanced Quest Cards
Advanced Quest cards are special quests that only come
into play when specified by an effect. The back of the card
lists special rewards that heroes or the overlord can acquire
by winning the quest. The reward is only received when
instructed by the Rewards section of the Quest Guide.
Advanced Quest cards are double-sided, and any player may
look at either side of one at any time.
```

## LABYRINTH OF RUIN

## SETUP

Mix all the _Labyrinth of Ruin_ components with their
corresponding components in the base game.

When using multiple expansions, mix together the respective
components.

Add all **Shop Item** and **Travel Event** cards to their respective
decks.

Add the **Class** , **Condition** , **Overlord** , and **Monster** cards to the
pool of available cards.

The **Lieutenant** , **Relic** , **Ally** , and **Ally Skill** cards are used only
when playing the _Labyrinth of Ruin_ campaign.

Add the **green power dice** , **Hero** sheets, hero and monster
**figures** , all **tokens** , and **map tiles** to their respective supplies.

## GREEN POWER DIE

Some weapons and abilities specifically call for the use of
the green power die.

## QUESTS

During setup, add the 19 new quests to the available
selection of quests.

They have either 1 or 2 encounters and may be linked
together to form a campaign.

If playing an Act II quest from this expansion outside of the
_Labyrinth of Ruin_ campaign, use the **Epic Play rules**. These
quests should be played at the Expert Level.

## HERO CLASSES

This expansion adds 4 new classes one for each archetype).

These are the **Apothecary** (Healer), **Beastmaster** (Warrior),
**Hexer** (Mage), and **Treasure Hunter** (Scout). Hero players may
choose these classes during setup.

## OVERLORD DECK

Some of the _Labyrinth of Ruin_ Overlord cards make up an
alternate deck of 15 basic cards, identified by the expansion
icon and labeled **Basic II**.

This alternate Overlord deck may replace the basic Overlord
deck.

At the start of a campaign, the overlord player chooses which
basic deck he wishes to use. He cannot mix basic cards
between decks. All other basic Overlord cards are returned
to the box.

Shuffle all cards belonging to the chosen basic Overlord deck
together to create the deck.

Many of these new Overlord cards have an additional effect if
played on the listed hero archetype. When the card is played
on an appropriate hero, the listed effect for the matching
archetype is applied in addition to the card’s normal effect.

Some Overlord cards do not have an experience cost and are
labeled **Quest Reward.** These are only available as a reward
for specific quests. When the overlord receives one of these
cards, he shuffles it into his Overlord deck as though it was a
purchased Overlord card.

## NEW TR AVEL EVENT CARDS

```
Some of the Labyrinth of Ruin Travel Event cards allow the
heroes to choose a hero belonging to a specific archetype to
keep the card in his play area.
If there are no heroes belonging to the listed archetype, the
card is discarded; continue to the next travel icon. If there is
a hero belonging to the listed archetype, the card is placed in
his play area and may be discarded to trigger its event.
```
```
If a Travel Event card is still in a player’s play area at the end
of a quest, the card is shuffled back into the Travel Event deck.
```
## TOKENS

## ELIXIR TOKENS

```
If you choose the Apothecary class during Hero
Setup, take the supply of elixir tokens. Place one
on your Hero sheet each time you are instructed to
gain 1 elixir token.
```
```
Each time you spend an elixir token, return the token from
your Hero sheet to the supply.
```
```
Elixir tokens remain on Hero sheets between encounters but
are discarded at the end of a quest. Elixir tokens are limited
to the available supply.
```
```
Any hero with an elixir token has the option of discarding it
at any point during his turn to recover damage (as printed on
the Brew Elixir Apothecary Class card).
Roll 1 red power die and recover damage equal to the
rolled. A knocked out hero cannot discard an elixir token
during his turn.
```
```
Heroes may trade elixir tokens following the normal trading
items rules.
```
## HEX TOKENS

```
If you choose the Hexer class during Hero Setup,
take the supply of hex tokens.
When a monster is hexed through the use of a
Hexer Class card, place 1 hex token near the
monster. A monster with at least 1 hex token is
known as a hexed monster.
```
```
Hex tokens are limited to the available supply.
```
```
A hero attacking a hexed monster may, after rolling dice,
discard 1 or more hex tokens from the target monster.
```
```
For each hex token discarded, the attack deals 1 additional
damage to the target monster (as printed on the Enfeebling
Hex Hexer Class card).
```
## THE SUN STONE TOKEN

```
This relic is represented by the sun stone token
and its Relic card. While a hero is equipped with
the Sun Stone relic, he places the token on his
Hero sheet. If he is ever defeated, place the sun
stone token in his space and set the Sun Stone
Relic card aside.
```
```
As an action, a hero or monster may pick up the sun stone
token. Place the token on the monster’s base if it picks it up;
if the monster is defeated, place the token in its space.
```
```
If a monster is carrying the sun stone token at the end of any
encounter, the token is returned to the box and the overlord
receives the Sun’s Fury Relic card.
```
```
Any lieutenant may wield this relic in addition to any other
relic he wields but does not drop the sun stone token when
defeated. This is an exception to the normal relic rules that
limit lieutenants to wielding only one relic at a time.
```
## TERR AIN

## ELEVATION

```
Elevation is represented by a dotted red line along the edge
of certain spaces. Elevation lines block movement but not LOS.
```
```
Adjacent spaces separated by an elevation line are still
adjacent; however, when a figure declares a melee attack
targeting a figure on the opposite side of an elevation line,
the target figure adds 1 additional black defense die to its
defense pool. The additional die is not added if the attacking
figure’s attack has the Reach keyword.
```
```
When determining movement for large monsters, elevation
lines block movement. However, when ending or interrupting
movement for large monsters, the monster figure may be
placed on spaces containing elevation lines, as long as those
spaces are empty. A figure with the Fly ability may move
through elevation lines.
```
## OVERGROWTH

```
Overgrowth are set up similar to doors in a quest and are
shown as green doors in the Quest Guide. Overgrowth does
not block movement but does block LOS.
```
```
Adjacent spaces separated by overgrowth are still considered
adjacent, but figures cannot attack through overgrowth.
However, figures can move through overgrowth.
When counting spaces for an ability, you may count spaces
through overgrowth. Large monsters cannot occupy 2 spaces
separated by overgrowth.
```
```
A figure may perform an open or close a door action to
remove 1 adjacent overgrowth from the map and return it to
the box (this is considered to be opening a door).
```
## CAMPAIGN RULES

## TR AVEL

```
When playing the Labyrinth of Ruin campaign, heroes use
the new campaign map, always begin the travel step at Pylia
Camp and must follow a continuous path to the chosen quest
location.
```
## CHOOSING QUESTS

```
The campaign consists of 9 quests, beginning with the
Introduction quest (Ruinous Whispers). Remaining quests are
chosen using the campaign log.
Act I
After completing the Introduction quest, the winner of the
quest chooses either Gathering Foretold or Honor Among
Thieves as the next quest. After completing an Act I quest,
the winner of that quest chooses between the 2 available
quests listed beneath it. Available quests are connected to
the completed quest by an arrow.
Note the Act I quests Fury of the Tempest and Back from
the Dead are always available during Act I of the campaign,
regardless of which quest was chosen after completing the
Introduction quest.
```
```
Interlude
After completing 3 Act I quests, the winner of the third Act
I quest must choose between either Interlude shown on the
campaign log. The Interlude is considered an Act I quest.
Act II
After completing the Interlude, immediately perform the Act
II steps listed in the core rules.
```
```
The winner of the Interlude chooses which Act II quest will
be played first. After each Act II quest, the winner of that
quest chooses which Act II quest will be played next.
```
```
When choosing Act II quests, players are free to choose any
Act II quest that has yet to be played during the campaign.
```
```
After completing 3 Act II quests, resolve one Campaign
phase as normal and then travel to the Finale quest.
```
```
Finale
The campaign ends in the Finale; there are two different
Finale quests. If the heroes won Tipping the Scales during
Act II, A Glimmer of Hope must be chosen as the Finale
quest. Otherwise Endless Night is the Finale quest. The
Finale is considered an Act II quest.
```
## ALLIES

```
Allies are specific to the Labyrinth of Ruin campaign and only
come into play through specific quests. They are represented
on the map by ally tokens, but are treated as hero figures for
the purposes of hero abilities, monster abilities and attacks,
and Overlord cards.
Allies have attributes and perform attribute tests just like
heroes. They are treated as friendly figures for heroes and
enemy figures for monsters.
```
```
Gaining Allies
Hero players may receive an ally as a reward from certain
quests. Take the appropriate Ally card and ally token and
place them in your play area (store ally components between
sessions during a campaign).
```
```
Ally Skills
When you receive an ally skill as a reward from a quest,
take the listed Ally Skill card associated with your current
ally. This functions similarly to a Class card and lists special
abilities and actions now available to the ally.
```
```
Controlling Allies
Certain quests in this expansion allow the heroes to control
an ally, as listed in the setup section of a quest. If the quest
states the heroes control their ally, the heroes control the
ally they received during the campaign. If playing the quest
outside of a campaign, the heroes may choose which ally
they control.
```
```
The ally’s token must be placed adjacent to a hero at the
start of a quest.
```
```
During such a quest, the hero players may activate the ally
once each round before the overlord’s turn, either before
or after a hero has completed his turn. Flip the Ally card
facedown to indicate the ally has been activated that round.
The ally may perform up to 2 of the following actions, and
only one of these actions may be an attack action:
```
```
Move: Move a number of space up to its Speed.
```
```
Attack: Attack a monster. An ally can attack only once during
its activation.
```
```
Revive a Hero: Revive a knocked out hero whose hero token
is in an adjacent space.
```
```
Ally Action: An ally’s unique actions are listed on their Ally
cards or Ally Skill cards with a. If any special action
allows the ally to perform an attack, it counts as the ally’s
one attack action for that activation.
```
```
Open or Close a Door: Open or close one adjacent door.
Special: Some quests provide allies with unique actions to
perform; these are stated as an action.
Allies can suffer damage and be affected by conditions.
When an ally is defeated, remove its token from the map.
The ally is essentially out of the game for the remainder of
the encounter. Allies recover all damage at the end of an
encounter.
```

## THE TROLLF ENS

## SETUP

Mix all _The Trollfens_ components with their corresponding
components in the base game. When using multiple
expansions, mix together the respective components.

The **Lieutenant** and **Relic** cards are used only when playing a
quest from this expansion.

When playing with this expansion, players must use all of the
new components.

When playing with multiple expansions that include rumors
and secret rooms, combine all **Rumor** cards, **Secret Room**
cards, and **challenge tokens** into their corresponding supplies.

Add all **Shop Item** and **Travel Event** cards to their respective
decks.

Replace the _Nothing_ card from the **Search** deck with the
_Secret Passage_ card before shuffling the deck. There should
be only one copy of this card in the deck (if playing with
other expansions).

Add the **Class** , **Condition** , **Relic** , **Overlord** , **Monster** and
**Lieutenant** cards to the pool of available cards.

Set the **Advanced Quest** cards aside. Place the shuffled
**Rumor** cards facedown near the Overlord deck. The overlord
draws 3 cards from this deck when a new campaign starts.

Add the **green power die** , **Hero** sheets, hero and monster
**figures** , all **tokens** , and **map tiles** to their respective supplies.

## GREEN POWER DIE

Some weapons and abilities specifically call for the use of
the green power die.

## QUESTS

Each of the 5 quests has 1 Encounter, and they are
incorporated into campaigns through the use of **Rumor** and
**Advanced Quest** cards. They may also be played as a mini
campaign.

## HERO CLASSES

The **Prophet** and the **Stalker** classes belong to the Healer
and Scout archetypes, respectively. Hero players may choose
these classes during setup.

## OVERLORD CARDS

The Overlord cards include 7 new cards of the **Infector**
Overlord class. The _Quest Reward_ cards do not have an
experience cost and cannot be purchased normally; it can
only be received as a quest reward, when it is shuffled it into
the Overlord deck as normal.

## TOKENS

## INSIGHT TOKEN

```
If you choose the Prophet class during Hero
Setup, take the insight token.
```
```
During a game, it is either in your play area or on a
player’s Hero sheet. Each time you are instructed
to gain the token, place it on your Hero sheet.
```
```
Only one player can have the insight token on his sheet at a
time. Each time the token is discarded (normally to trigger
an effect), it is placed in the Prophet player’s play area. The
insight token remains on a Hero sheet between encounters,
but not between quests.
```
## TR AP TOKENS

```
If you choose the Stalker class during Hero Setup,
take the supply of trap tokens.
```
```
Each time you use an ability that places 1 trap
token, take one from the supply and place it on
the map as instructed.
They do not block movement or LOS, and only one may
occupy a space. Trap tokens are limited by the amount in
the supply.
```
## INF ECTION TOKENS

```
Infection tokens are used with the Infector
Overlord class. During the Spend Experience
Points step of the Campaign phase, if the overlord
includes an Infector Overlord card in his deck, he
takes the supply of infection tokens.
```
```
Each time a hero is infected by an Infector Overlord card, he
takes an infection token and places it on his Hero sheet. A
hero with at least 1 infection token is infected.
Infection tokens remain on a Hero sheet between encounters,
but not between quests. Infection tokens are limited by the
amount in the supply.
```
## CONDITION (WEAKENED)

```
Condition cards and tokens for the Weakened
condition are added to the existing supply of
Condition cards and tokens.
```
## SECRET ROOMS

```
Heroes are not required to explore a secret room to complete
the quest. They cannot explore a secret room if there is
already a secret room card in play.
```
```
When you draw the Secret Passage Search card,
place a secret room entrance token in your space.
```
```
If the card is drawn when the heroes are not on the map,
draw a replacement Search card and shuffle the card back
into the Search deck.
```
```
A hero in the same space as a secret room entrance token
may spend 1 MP to explore. Draw and resolve 1 Secret Room
card. If the card instructs you to place a secret room tile:
```
**1. Place Secret Room:** Place the appropriate secret room tile
    near (not connected) to the map. The tile code on the tile
    must match the tile code on the Secret Room card.
**2. Move Hero:** Place your hero figure on the secret room tile’s
    **entrance space** (with the secret room entrance icon).
**3. Place Challenge Tokens:** The overlord randomly draws
    challenge tokens equal to the number of heroes and,
    without looking at them, places each facedown in a corner
    on the tile as follows, only one challenge token per space.

## 2

## 2

## 3

## 4

```
During your turn, if your hero figure is
in a secret room entrance space, you may
spend 1 MP to move to any other secret
room entrance space as if they were
adjacent. Monsters cannot use secret
room entrances.
```
```
If you move your figure to an occupied secret room entrance
space, place it in the closest available empty space of choice.
```
```
Challenge tokens
When your hero is adjacent to or in a space containing a
facedown challenge token, you may perform a search action
to flip the token faceup (do not draw a Search card). The face
of each token displays either a monster or an attribute icon.
```
```
If the revealed token displays a monster , place it in the
closest available empty space from where it was revealed and
treat it as a minion monster figure of the indicated type. It
does not count against the overlord’s monster group limits,
and uses its corresponding Monster card of the current Act.
If the monster belongs to a monster group that is currently
inactive, the challenge token is immediately discarded.
```
```
If the revealed token displays an attribute icon , the hero must
immediately test that attribute. If he passes, immediately
draw a Search card and discard the challenge token. If he
fails, still discard the token but do not draw a Search card.
```
```
At the start of each overlord turn in which there is a hero on
a secret room tile, the overlord may discard one challenge
token or monster figure from the secret room tile. Choose
before the overlord draws his Overlord card. The discarded
token is not revealed.
```
```
Secret room rewards
As soon as there are zero challenge tokens and zero monster
figures on the secret room tile, the player taking his turn
resolves any Reward effects on the Secret Room card. If
multiple hero figures are on the tile, the heroes choose one of
them to resolve the reward effect.
Then, players remove all heroes from the secret room tile
and place them in empty spaces nearest to the secret room
entrance token and the secret room tile and entrance token are
discarded. The player whose turn was paused resumes his turn.
```
```
Knocked out in a secret room
If a hero is knocked out while in a secret room, all normal
rules for being knocked out are followed, except the player
places his hero token in the secret entrance token’s space,
even if that space is not empty.
```
```
Refreshing the Secret Room deck
At the end of each encounter, discard all Secret Room cards
in play that have not been claimed as rewards. At the end
of each quest, shuffle all discarded Secret Room cards back
into the Secret Room deck.
```
## RUMORS

```
The overlord can play a maximum of 1 Rumor card from his
hand, at a time stated on the card, during each Campaign
phase. The hero players immediately resolve the card’s text
before continuing the Campaign phase.
```
```
At the start of Act II, the overlord must discard any Rumor
cards that can only be played in Act I. He does not draw
replacements. Discards are not shuffled back into the Rumor
deck, and if the deck runs out of cards, it is not reshuffled. If
the overlord must draw a Rumor card and there are no cards
in the deck, he does not draw one.
```
## QUEST CARDS

```
Quest cards are both Advanced Quests cards and Rumor
cards that feature quests ( Rumor Quest cards). They are
quests that players can choose during the Choose Next Quest
step of a Campaign phase.
```
```
When they enter play, they are placed faceup on the table
and become available quests.
```
```
Rumor Quest cards are played by the overlord as instructed.
Advanced Quest cards only enter play when instructed by a
game effect.
```
```
Each time a player (overlord or hero) would choose a quest
during the Choose Next Quest step of the Campaign phase,
he can choose any available quest : either a quest on the
campaign sheet or a Quest card on the table. When you
choose the latter, immediately begin quest setup as normal,
referring to the corresponding quest in the Quest Guide.
```
```
Before attempting these quests, perform the Travel step of
the Campaign phase as normal, but instead of referencing
the quest map, refer to the travel icons at the top of the
appropriate Quest card. These icons are resolved from left to
right as if they were on the path leading to the quest.
```
```
Quest cards remain in play until completed or discarded by
a game effect. They are not automatically discarded at the
start of the Campaign phase, and can persist from session to
session until completed.
```
```
Between sessions, store any available Quest cards as a
reminder that the quest has not been attempted yet. After
either the heroes or the overlord wins a quest, the victor may
store the card with the rest of his materials as a reminder
that he won that quest.
```
```
Act Specific Quest Cards
Some Quest cards have the Act I or Act II icon in the upper
left hand corner, and can only be attempted during the
corresponding act.
If one or more Act I Quest cards are still in play immediately
before playing the Interlude, the heroes must choose one of
them to attempt before proceeding to the Interlude. After
completing this quest, all other available Act I Quest cards
are discarded from the game without effect.
```
```
Completing a Quest card
The Quest Guide lists all rewards for winning each quest.
Perform the Campaign phase as normal after completing a
Quest card.
```
```
Any quest attempted as a result of a Quest card does not
count against the number of quests required to complete for
the current act. Quest cards are always played in addition to
the required number of campaign quests in a particular act.
Also, players do not have to attempt any Quest cards in order
to complete the campaign, and may ignore all quests from
Quest cards when determining how many quests are won by
the overlord or the heroes during any given act.
```
```
Advanced Quest Cards
Advanced Quest cards are special quests that only come
into play when specified by an effect. The back of the card
lists special rewards that heroes or the overlord can acquire
by winning the quest. The reward is only received when
instructed by the Rewards section of the Quest Guide.
```
```
Advanced Quest cards are double-sided, and any player may
look at either side of one at any time.
```

## SHAD OW OF NEREKHALL

## SETUP

Mix all the _Shadow of Nerekhall_ components with their
corresponding components in the base game. When
using multiple expansions, mix together the respective
components.

The **Lieutenant** , **Relic** and **Corrupt Citizen** cards are used only
when playing a quest from this expansion.

When playing with this expansion, players must use all of the
new components.

Add all **Shop Item** cards to their respective decks.

Add the **Class** , **Condition** , **Overlord** , and **Monster** cards to the
pool of available cards. Shuffle the **City Event** cards with any
other City Event cards from other expansions.

Add the **green power dice** , **Hero** sheets, hero and monster
**figures** , all **tokens** , and **map tiles** to their respective supplies.

## GREEN POWER DIE

Some weapons and abilities specifically call for the use of
the green power die.

## QUESTS

During setup, add the 19 new quests to the available
selection of quests. They have either 1 or 2 encounters and
may be linked together to form a campaign.

## HERO CLASSES

The **Bard** (Healer), **Skirmisher** (Warrior), **Conjurer** (Mage), and
**Shadow Walker** (Scout) classes may be chosen during setup.

## OVERLORD CARDS

The Overlord cards include 7 new cards of the
**Shadowmancer** Overlord class. There are also 5 new
Universal Overlord cards.

## TOKENS

## SONG TOKENS

```
The Bard has several skills that interact with
song tokens. If you choose the Bard class during
setup, place the song tokens near your play area.
```
```
There are 2 tokens: melody and harmony. These
are either near the Bard’s play area or on 1 of his
Class cards. Each time an effect allows you to
place a song token, take one of the tokens from
its current location and place it as indicated.
Each token can be on only 1 Class card at a time.
```
Some Class cards have effects that may trigger when a song
token is on that card, and contain symbols that match the
symbol on the token, either **melody** or **harmony**.

When a song token is on a Class card with a matching song
effect, that effect triggers. Class cards with song effects
trigger only if the corresponding token is on that card. Song
tokens remain on Class cards when the Bard is knocked out,
but the tokens and any matching song effects are not active.
At the end of an encounter, the Bard returns all song tokens
to the supply.

## IMAGE TOKENS

```
The Conjurer has several skills that interact with
image tokens. If you choose the Conjurer class
during setup, place the image tokens near your
play area.
```
```
When an effect allows you to place an image token, place it on
the map in a space indicated. Each token is treated as a hero
figure with the Conjurer’s attributes and 1 gray defense die.
If an image token suffers any amount of or , it is
discarded, and the Conjurer suffers 1 and 1.
```
```
At any time during his turn, the Conjurer may return any
number of image tokens on the map to his supply. The
number that can be on the map at any one time is limited
only by the supply.
```
## SHAD OW SOUL FAMILIAR

```
The Shadow Walker may summon and control
a Shadow Soul familiar. These follows all rules
for familiars, with exceptions described on the
Shadow Soul Class card.
```
## TERR AIN

## ELEVATION

```
Elevation is represented by an elevation line : a dotted red
line along the edge of a space. These block movement but
not LOS.
```
```
Adjacent spaces separated by an elevation line are still
considered adjacent. However, when a figure declares a
melee attack targeting a figure on the opposite side of an
elevation line, the target figure adds 1 additional black
defense die to its defense pool.
This does not apply if the attacking figure’s attack has the
Reach keyword.
Elevation lines block large monster movement. However,
when ending or interrupting movement for large monsters,
the monster figure may be placed on spaces containing
elevation lines, as long as those spaces are empty.
A figure with the Fly ability may move through elevation lines.
A figure cannot move diagonally across elevation through a
shared corner of an elevation line and a wall (the black edge
of a map tile).
```
## PORTCULLIS

```
A portcullis is set up in the same way as a door and is shown
as a gray door in the Quest Guide.
Figures cannot move through a portcullis, but they may
perform attacks, trace LOS, and count spaces through them.
Spaces separated by a portcullis are considered adjacent.
A figure may perform an open or close a door action to open
or close 1 adjacent portcullis (it is considered to be opening
a door).
```
## HAZARD

```
Any space with a yellow line around it is a hazard space.
A figure entering a hazard space suffers 1 damage. Any
figure that ends its turn in a hazard space is immediately
defeated.
```
```
Defeated heroes place their hero token in the nearest empty
space that does not contain a hazard. A large monster is
defeated only if all spaces it occupies are hazard spaces.
Any effect or ability that applies to lava spaces applies to
hazard spaces, and any effect or ability that applies to hazard
spaces applies to lava spaces.
```
## CAMPAIGN RULES

## TR AVEL

```
The Shadow of Nerekhall campaign uses a new campaign
map. Heroes begin the travel step at Ironbrick Inn and follow
a continuous path to the chosen quest location. Additionally,
players use City Event cards when playing this campaign
instead of Travel Event cards. These follow the same rules as
Travel Event cards. For each travel icon players stop at, they
draw a City Event card and resolve the event based on the
matching icon.
```
## CHOOSING QUESTS

```
There are a total of 9 quests in the campaign, beginning with
the Introduction quest A Demonstration , which is treated
as an Act I quest. Remaining quests are chosen using the
Shadow of Nerekhall campaign log.
```
```
Act I
When choosing Act I quests, players can choose any Act
I quest they have not played during the campaign. After
completing an Act I quest, the winner of that quest chooses
the next quest. After completing 3 Act I quests (excluding
the Introduction), it is time for the Interlude. Players resolve
1 Campaign phase as normal, and then the heroes travel to
the Interlude quest.
Interlude
The interlude is a special quest that marks the transition
from Act I to Act II of the campaign. There are 2 different
Interlude quests. If the heroes won at least 2 of the Act I
quests (excluding the Introduction), the players must choose
The True Enemy as the Interlude quest.
```
```
If the overlord won at least 2 of the Act I quests (excluding
the Introduction), the players must choose Traitors Among Us
as the Interlude quest.
```
```
Each Interlude is treated as an Act I quest.
Act II
After completing the Interlude, the campaign transitions to
Act II. Immediately perform the standard Act II steps. After
completing these steps, the winner of the Interlude chooses
Overdue Demise or Arise My Friends as the next quest. This
is indicated by the arrows connecting those quests to the Act
II symbol.
After completing an Act II quest, the winner of that quest
chooses between the 2 available quests listed beneath it
on the campaign log. Available quests are connected to the
completed quest by an arrow.
```
```
After completing 3 Act II quests, players resolve one
Campaign phase as normal, and then they travel to the Finale
quest to determine the winner of the campaign.
Finale
The campaign ends 1 of the 2 Finale quests. If the heroes
won at least 2 of the Act II quests, they must choose The
Black Realm as the Finale quest. If the overlord won at least
2 of the Act II quests, the players must choose The City Falls
as the Finale quest. The Finale is treated as an Act II quest.
```
## INF LUENCE EFF ECTS

```
Influence effects and the influence tokens are specific to the
Shadow of Nerekhall campaign during certain quests. At the
start of the campaign, during Overlord setup, the overlord
takes the 3 influence tokens.
```
```
A quest may feature up to 3 different influence effects. The
3 tokens correspond to the influence effects listed in each
quest’s influence sidebar. The active influence effect for a
quest depends on the influence token that is selected for
that quest.
```
## INF LUENCE TOKENS

```
During Setup, when quest rules instruct the
overlord to choose his influence effect, he secretly
chooses 1 of the influence effects listed in the
influence sidebar of that quest.
```
```
The overlord places the corresponding influence
token facedown in his play area and sets aside
any unused influence tokens facedown. No
hero player should know the color of any of
the influence tokens. If a quest features only 2
influence effects, the token that does not have a
corresponding effect is set aside.
```
```
Quests may instruct the overlord to shuffle the influence
tokens listed, place 1 facedown in his play area, and set
aside the remaining tokens. In these quests, no player ,
including the overlord, should know the color of any tokens.
```
```
When the quest rules instruct the overlord to reveal his
influence effect, he reveals the chosen facedown token and
resolves the effects.
```
## CORRUPT CITIZENS

```
The overlord has the opportunity to corrupt various characters
that the heroes meet. These corrupt citizens enter play using
one the changeling monster.
The overlord player receives a corrupt citizen as a reward
for winning certain quests. Take the corresponding Corrupt
Citizen card. Between sessions of a campaign, the overlord
player stores Corrupt Citizen cards as a reminder of which
corrupt citizens he possesses.
```
```
During quests in the campaign, the overlord may play any
Corrupt Citizen cards in his possession. Changeling monsters
must be present in the quest in order to do so.
When a master changeling is placed on the map, the overlord
may play a Corrupt Citizen card, placing it faceup near the
changeling Monster card. In addition to everything listed on
the changeling Monster card, the master changeling gains all
effects listed on the Corrupt Citizen card.
```
```
Only 1 Corrupt Citizen card may be in play at any time.
```
```
If a master changeling with a Corrupt Citizen card is not
defeated during an encounter, the overlord returns that
Corrupt Citizen card to his play area and may play it again
during another encounter in the campaign.
If a master changeling with a Corrupt Citizen card is
defeated, the overlord returns that Corrupt Citizen card to the
game box and cannot use it again during the campaign.

**Harmony**


## MANOR OF R AVENS

## SETUP

Mix all the _Manor of Ravens_ components with their
corresponding components in the base game. When using
multiple expansions, mix together the respective components.

Add the **Class** , **Condition** , **Shop Item** , **Relic** , **Overlord** ,
**Monster** , and **Lieutenant** cards to the pool of available cards.

Combine the **Rumor** cards with those from other expansions
(if you do not have any other Rumor cards, create a new deck
with the cards in this expansion).

Add the **Hero** sheets, hero and monster **figures** , all **tokens** ,
and **map tiles** to their respective supplies.

## QUESTS

The new quests can be incorporated into any campaign either
through the use of Rumor cards; strung together as a mini
campaign; or each played as an independent quest playing
the basic game or Epic Play rules. If played independently,
ignore each quest’s Rewards section.

**Overlord Servants**

The **Unkindness** Overlord class includes **Summon cards.** The
overlord purchases Summon cards normally during the Spend
Experience Points step of the Campaign phase.

Place a Summon card faceup in your play area when you
purchase it, instead of adding it to your deck. It does not
count toward your deck size or toward your ability to purchase
higher level cards. Also take the corresponding **Servant card**
and **token**.

Each time you use the Summon card, place the corresponding
servant token as indicated by the Summon card. The token is
treated as a minion monster in its own group and follows the
same rules as other monsters.

## OVERLORD CARDS

When the overlord plays an Overlord card that **remains in play**
on a monster group, it is kept faceup in his play area until it
must be discarded.

There are 3 Overlord cards available as rewards for specific
quests. When instructed, such a card is added to the
Overlord deck as though it was purchased.

## RELIC CARDS

The 2 new Relic card types follow the normal rules for relics.
They cannot be wielded by lieutenants.

**Monster relics** are wielded by monster groups in the same
way regular relics are wielded by lieutenants. During setup
of each encounter, the overlord chooses which monster relic
(if any) each of his monster groups will wield. Each monster
group can wield only 1 relic. Place the chosen Relic card
next to the monster group’s card; it remains there until the
end of the encounter, even if all monsters in that group are
defeated. A monster relic has no effect if it is not wielded by
a monster group.

**Universal relics** are not wielded; they are placed in the
overlord’s play area and remain there for the rest of the
campaign. The overlord can use universal relics by following
the instructions on the card.

## TOKENS

## TR ACKING TOKEN

```
If you choose the Bounty Hunter class, take
the tracking token.
```
```
Each time the Bounty Hunter tracks a monster,
he places the token on the base of the tracked figure. The
Bounty Hunter can track only 1 monster at a time.
Each time a tracked monster is defeated, the Bounty Hunter
takes back the tracking token.
```
## RUMORS

```
When starting a new campaign, the overlord shuffles the
Rumor deck and draws 3 cards.
```
```
The overlord can play a maximum of 1 Rumor card during
each Campaign phase and can only play them, at the time
indicated, during the act that corresponds with the act icon
on the upper left of the card. The heroes must immediately
resolve the text on the Rumor card before continuing.
```
```
At the start of Act II, the overlord must discard any Rumor
cards that have the Act I restriction, and any Rumor cards
that are in play that have that restriction are also discarded.
He does not draw replacements. Discards are not shuffled
back into the Rumor deck, and if the deck runs out of cards,
it is not reshuffled. If the overlord must draw a Rumor card
and there are no cards in the deck, he does not draw one.
```
## QUEST CARDS

```
Quest cards are both Advanced Quests cards and Rumor
cards that feature quests ( Rumor Quest cards). They are
quests that players can choose during the Choose Next Quest
step of a Campaign phase.
```
```
When they enter play, they are placed faceup on the table
and become available quests.
```
```
Rumor Quest cards are played by the overlord as instructed.
```
```
Advanced Quest cards only enter play when instructed by a
game effect.
```
```
Quest cards that have an act icon can only be chosen during
the act designated on the card.
```
```
Each time a player (overlord or hero) would choose a quest
during the Choose Next Quest step of the Campaign phase,
he can choose any available quest : either a quest on the
campaign sheet or a Quest card on the table. When you
choose the latter, immediately begin quest setup as normal,
referring to the corresponding quest in the Quest Guide.
```
```
Before attempting these quests, perform the Travel step of
the Campaign phase as normal, but instead of referencing
the quest map, refer to the travel icons at the top of the
appropriate Quest card. These icons are resolved from left to
right as if they were on the path leading to the quest.
```
```
Quest cards remain in play until completed or discarded by
a game effect. They are not automatically discarded at the
start of the Campaign phase, and can persist from session to
session until completed.
```
```
Between sessions, store any available Quest cards as a
reminder that the quest has not been attempted yet. After
either the heroes or the overlord wins a quest, the victor may
store the card with the rest of his materials as a reminder
that he won that quest.
```
```
Completing a Quest card
The Quest Guide lists all rewards for winning each quest.
Perform the Campaign phase as normal after completing a
Quest card.
```
```
Any quest attempted as a result of a Quest card does not
count against the number of quests required to complete for
the current act. Quest cards are always played in addition to
the required number of campaign quests in a particular act.
Also, players do not have to attempt any Quest cards in order
to complete the campaign, and may ignore all quests from
Quest cards when determining how many quests are won by
the overlord or the heroes during any given act.
```
```
Advanced Quest Cards
Advanced Quest cards are special quests that only come
into play when specified by an effect. The back of the card
lists special rewards that heroes or the overlord can acquire
by winning the quest. The reward is only received when
instructed by the Rewards section of the Quest Guide.
```
```
Advanced Quest cards are double-sided, and any player may
look at either side of one at any time.
```
## MINI CAMPAIGN RULES

```
Play the Manor of Ravens mini campaign following the
normal campaign rules in addition to the following changes.
Players cannot use Rumor cards when playing a mini
campaign.
```
**1. Setup** Perform all normal rules for game setup. Each hero
    receives 4 XPs and 100 gold, and the overlord receives
    4 XPs. Then, players perform a Spend Experience Points
    step and a Shopping step. Players may save any unspent
    gold and experience points to spend in future Campaign
    phases. Players can record their gold and experience
    points on the Campaign log on page 9.
**2. Travel** Perform a travel step beginning at the _Mountain_
    _Pass_.
**3. Quest ##1** Play the _Spread Your Wings_ quest.
**4. Campaign Phase** Perform a Campaign phase, skipping
    the Choose Next Quest step. Heroes begin travel from the
    _Spread your Wings_ quest.
**5. Quest ##2** Play the _Finders and Keepers_ quest.
**6. Campaign Phase** Perform a Campaign phase, skipping
    the Choose Next Quest step. Heroes begin travel from the
    _Finders and Keepers_ quest.
**7. Quest ##3** Play the _My House, My Rules_ quest.
**8. Transition to Act II** Perform the steps listed under Act
    II on page 22 of _Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second_
    _Edition_ rulebook.
**9. Campaign Phase** Perform a standard Campaign phase
    (see step 10 below for which quests may be chosen).
    Heroes begin travel from the _My House, My Rules_ quest.
**10. Finale** If the heroes won more quests than the overlord
    during Act I, they choose the next quest from those that
    correspond with any quest that they won.

```
If the overlord won more quests than the heroes during Act
I, he chooses the next quest from those that correspond
with any quest that he won (see the Campaign log for which
Finales correspond with which quests).
```
```
Additional Quest Rewards
At the end of each quest during a mini campaign, each
player receives 1 XP. This experience is awarded to both the
winning and losing players and is in addition to the rewards
listed for each quest in the Quest Guide.
```
```
Also, if the heroes win a quest, they can choose 1 hero to
receive 1 random Shop Item card from the Shop deck.
```
```
If the overlord wins a quest, he receives 1 additional XP.
```

## MISTS OF BILEHALL

## THE CHAINS THAT RUST

## SETUP

Mix all components with their corresponding components in
the base game. When using multiple expansions, mix together
the respective components.

Add **Condition** , **Class, Shop Item** , **Relic** , **Monster, Overlord,
Travel Event** , and **Lieutenant** cards to the pool of available
cards. Combine **Tainted** cards together.

## TERR AIN

## HAZARD TERR AIN

A space surrounded by a yellow line is a **hazard** space.
Like lava spaces, a figure entering a hazard space suffers 1
damage. Any figure that ends its turn in a hazard space is
immediately _defeated_. Defeated heroes place their hero token
in the nearest empty space that is not a hazard space. A large
monster is defeated only if all spaces it occupies are a hazard.

Any effect or ability that applies to lava spaces applies to
hazard spaces, and vice versa.

## SLUD GE TERR AIN

A space surrounded by an orange line is a **sludge** space. A
figure moving into a sludge space must spend 1 additional
MP or it cannot enter. When a figure starts its turn/activation
and each space it occupies is a sludge space, its Speed is 1
and cannot be increased until the end of that turn/activation.

## ELEVATION

An **elevation line** is a dotted red line along the edge of a
space. They block movement but not LOS. Adjacent spaces
separated by an elevation line are still considered adjacent.
However, when a figure targets a figure on the opposite side
of an elevation line in a melee attack, the target figure adds
**1 additional black defense die** to its defense pool. If the
attacking figure’s attack has _Reach_ or _Extend_ , the target does
not add the additional die.

Elevation lines block large monster movement; but when
ending or interrupting movement for large monsters, the
figure may be placed on spaces containing elevation lines, as
long as they are empty.

A figure cannot move diagonally through a shared corner of
an elevation line and a wall (the black edge of a map tile).

## OLD WALL

An old wall is set up like a door and is shown as a blue
rectangle on quest maps. Old walls cannot be opened and
closed, and figures cannot trace LOS or count spaces through
them. Spaces separated by an old wall are not adjacent.

## CRUMBLING TERR AIN

When placed near an old wall, crumbling terrain tokens may
need to be rotated to fit. A space that contains crumbling
terrain loses all other terrain types except for obstacles.

Each time a hero enters a space that contains crumbling
terrain, he may test or (his choice). If you fail, or
choose not to test, remove that crumbling terrain token from
the map and suffer the effects of the other terrain in that

```
space as normal; if the revealed terrain requires 1 additional
movement point to enter, suffer 1 instead. If a figure is in
a space that contains crumbling terrain, other figures cannot
enter that space.
```
## HYBRID CLASSES

```
If you choose a hybrid class during Hero Setup, the basic skill
card associated with the hybrid class instructs you to choose
1 additional standard Class deck belonging to a different
archetype (you cannot choose another hybrid class). Your
archetype is not changed when you choose a hybrid class.
```
```
After choosing the additional deck, you receives its basic
skills and starting equipment. Each time you spend
experience, you may purchase skills from either Class deck,
excluding experience 3 cards from the additional deck.
```
## OVERLORD SERVANTS

```
The Soulbinder Overlord class includes a new type of
Overlord card: the Summon card.
The overlord purchases Summon cards normally during the
Spend Experience Points step of the Campaign phase. Place a
Summon card faceup in your play area when you purchase it
instead of adding it to your deck; it does not count toward your
deck size or toward your ability to purchase higher-level cards.
Place the corresponding Servant card and token in your
play area. Each time you use the Summon card, take the
corresponding servant token from its current location and
place it as indicated by the Summon card. The servant token
is treated as a minion monster in its own group, and follows
the same rules as other monsters.
```
## RELICS

```
Monster and universal relics follow the normal rules for relics.
They cannot be wielded by lieutenants and monster relics
have no effect if they are not wielded by a monster group.
Monster relics are wielded by monster groups in the same
way regular relics are wielded by lieutenants. During setup
of each encounter, the overlord chooses which monster relic
(if any) each of his monster groups will wield. Each monster
group can wield only 1 monster relic. Place the chosen Relic
card next to the monster group’s card. It remains there until
the end of the encounter, even if all monsters in that group
are defeated.
```
```
Universal relics are not wielded. When the overlord receives a
universal relic, he places it in his play area for the rest of the
campaign and may use it by following its instructions.
```
## TAINTED CARDS

```
At the start of each quest, the overlord shuffles the Tainted
cards and deals 1 card facedown near each hero’s Hero
sheet. No player should know which card has been dealt to
any hero. Place the remaining cards aside.
While a hero has a Tainted card, apply +2 to his Health.
When a hero with a facedown Tainted card is defeated, he
flips that card faceup. He is then affected by that card until
the end of the quest or a game effect flips it facedown again.
```
## MISTS OF BILEHALL CAMPAIGN RULES

```
Players play a total of 5 quests in the Mists of
Bilehall campaign, beginning with the Introduction
quest Strange Awakening. This quest is treated as
an Act I quest.
```
```
All travel references the new Mists of Bilehall
campaign map. Heroes begin the travel step at
Mistbound Conclave and follow a continuous path to the
chosen quest location shown on the campaign map.
```
```
During setup of the Introduction, each player receives 1 XP
that they may immediately spend. Remaining quests are
chosen using the Mists of Bilehall campaign log.
```
```
The winner of the Introduction chooses either Sanguine Lord
or Song of Bone as the next quest. After completing a quest,
the winner of that quest chooses between the 2 available
quests listed beneath it on the campaign log (connected to
the completed quest by an arrow).
```
```
After completing 3 Act I quests, proceed to the Finale.
Players resolve 1 Campaign phase as normal, and then the
heroes travel to the Hallowing Fire quest to determine the
winner of the campaign.
The Finale is a two-encounter quest in which the players
always play the same first encounter, but progress to a
different second encounter depending on who won the
previous quest.
```
```
If the heroes won the Juliden’s Keep quest or the Shattered
Schemes quest, play Encounter 2a as the second encounter.
If the overlord won the Juliden’s Keep quest or the Shattered
Schemes quest, play Encounter 2b as the second encounter.
```
## CHAINS THAT RUST CAMPAIGN RULES

```
When playing the standalone campaign, before
setup of the Introduction each player receives
5XP that they may immediately spend.
```
```
The heroes then receive 225 gold per hero and may shop the
entire Act I deck. Then, return all Act I Shop Item, Monster,
and Lieutenant cards to the box; The Chains that Rust uses
Act II cards.
```
```
Players play a total of 5 quests in The Chains That Rust
campaign, beginning with the Introduction quest Castle
Dalibor.
```
```
The outcome of each quest determines which quest will be
available next, as indicated by the arrows connecting quests:
if the heroes win a quest, follow the left-hand arrow; if the
overlord wins, follow the right-hand arrow. If there is only one
arrow, follow that arrow. After completing a quest, the winner
of that quest chooses which of the available quests will be
played next.
After completing 4 quests (including the Interlude), proceed
to the Finale. Players resolve 1 Campaign phase as normal,
and then the heroes travel to the Profane Nexus quest to
determine the winner of the campaign.
```
```
The Finale is a two-encounter quest in which the players
always play the same first encounter, but progress to a
different second encounter depending on who won the
previous quest.
```
## COMBINED CAMPAIGN

```
Each of the campaigns are a one-act campaign, but can be
combined to form a two-act campaign.
```
```
Follow the Mists of Bilehall campaign rules, but instead of
playing Hallowing Fire as the Finale, treat it as the Interlude.
Immediately after completing Hallowing Fire , each player
gains 1 XP.
Page 8 of The Chains the Rust rules has alternative victory
text. Victorious heroes gain 25 gold per hero. After reading
the appropriate victory text, transition to Act II and return the
Mists of Bilehall tiles to the box.
```
```
Then, the winner of Hallowing Fire chooses either Legion’s
Hunter or Freedom from Flesh as the first Act II quest,
following the restrictions of the The Chains the Rust
‘Choosing Quests’ section above. Castle Dalibor is not played
during the combined campaign. After completing a quest, the
winner of that quest chooses an available quest.
```

## LIEUTENANT PACKS

## PLOT CARDS

After hero players choose their classes at the start of a
campaign, the overlord may choose 1 **Plot deck** for the
duration of the campaign.

The overlord then places the **basic card** (the one with no
purchase cost) faceup in his play area. The remaining Plot
cards with the same deck name are placed facedown; he may
look at them at any time.

Plot cards are upgrades the overlord may purchase
throughout a campaign that provide him with special abilities
when the card is faceup in his play area. Plot cards are _not_
Overlord cards.

## PURCHASING & TRIGGERING PLOT CARDS

Each Plot card has a **purchase cost** in **threat tokens**. During
the Spend Experience Points step of each Campaign phase,
the overlord may purchase _any_ of his facedown Plot cards
by spending threat tokens equal to the card’s purchase cost.
Purchased Plot cards are placed faceup and can be used in
_all future quests_ during the campaign.

The overlord can trigger abilities on a faceup Plot card as
specified on it. Each time he triggers a Plot card ability that
requires him to _exhaust this card_ or _use this card_ , he must
spend threat tokens equal to the Plot card’s **trigger cost**.

```
Threat and Fortune
The red side of the token represents
threat , and the white side represents
fortune. During setup, place these tokens
within easy reach of all players.
```
The overlord may spend threat tokens he has gained to
purchase or trigger abilities described on Plot cards.

A hero may spend fortune tokens to receive certain benefits.

## GAINING THREAT TOKENS

**Each time a hero is defeated during an encounter, instead of
drawing 1 Overlord card, the overlord may gain 1 threat token**.

The overlord can only gain threat tokens in this way once per
hero per quest.

If he does so, the overlord takes 1 hero token belonging to
the hero and places it near his Plot deck as a reminder that
he gained a threat token for defeating that hero. There are
other ways in which the overlord may gain threat tokens:

- At the end of each quest, he receives 1 threat token.
    If he wins the quest, he receives 1 additional threat token.
- During the Spend Experience Points step of any Campaign
    phase, he may spend any number of his experience points
    to gain 3 threat tokens for each point he spends.
- Each time he plays a Rumor card featuring a quest,
    he gains 1 threat token.

Each time the overlord gains a threat token, he takes 1 from
the supply and places it in his play area, threat side faceup.

Tokens gained during a campaign remain in his play area
until spent. Between quests, the overlord records the amount
of unspent threat tokens in the Campaign log.

```
Spending Threat Tokens
The overlord spends threat tokens as follows:
```
- **Purchasing Plot cards:** During the Spend Experience
    Points step of the Campaign phase, each threat token
    spent to purchase Plot cards is returned to the supply.
- **Triggering Plot cards:** Each time the overlord spends a
    threat token to trigger a Plot card, he must flip the token
    to its fortune side and place it on the Hero sheet which
    currently possesses the lowest number of fortune tokens.

```
If there is a tie, the heroes choose which hero among the tied
heroes gains the token. If the overlord spends more than 1
threat token, follow this process once for each one spent.
```
```
Spending Fortune Tokens
Heroes may spend fortune tokens to trigger the following:
```
- **1 fortune token:** During his turn, a hero may recover 1.
- **1 fortune token:** After dice are rolled, a hero may reroll
    1 of his dice.
- **2 fortune tokens:** After performing his 2 normal actions,
    a hero may immediately perform 1 additional action.
    Limit once per round per hero.
- **2 fortune tokens:** During the Shopping step of the
    Campaign phase, heroes may collectively spend their
    fortune tokens to draw 1 additional Shop Item card.

```
When a hero spends a fortune token, he returns it to the
supply. Heroes cannot trade their fortune tokens to other
heroes. After the Shopping step of each Campaign phase,
return all fortune tokens on Hero sheets to the supply.
```
```
Monster Sizes and Traits
Monster size is defined by the number of spaces a monster’s
base occupies:
```
- **Small** monsters occupy 1 space.
- **Medium** monsters occupy 2 spaces.
- **Huge** monsters occupy 4 spaces.
- **Massive** monsters occupy 6 spaces.

```
Medium, huge, and massive monsters are still large monsters
for the purposes of movement and quest rules.
```
## AGENTS

```
Some Plot cards allow the overlord to use a lieutenant
figure as an agent in an open monster group. The Agent
card corresponding to the current act lists the agent’s
characteristics, abilities, and attack dice. An agent is treated
as a master monster within its open monster group, however:
```
- Regardless of quest rules, an agent cannot be placed as a
    reinforcement.
- When an agent is defeated, the overlord must return the
    Plot card that summoned it back to his Plot deck. The
    card may be purchased again.
- As described on the Plot card, the overlord cannot use an
    agent in any quest that features the lieutenant version of
    that agent (and in some specific campaigns).
Plot cards that allow the overlord to summon an agent often
require him to replace master and minion monsters of an
open group after setup of an encounter. If he cannot meet the
replacement requirements, he replaces the entire open group.

```
When an agent is placed in a monster group, it and the
monsters are treated as if they are part of the same monster
group. While the agent is on the map, the overlord cannot use
the monster figures it replaced as reinforcements, regardless
of quest rules. The overlord cannot summon an agent during
an Interlude or a Finale. Unlike lieutenants, an agent cannot
wield a relic.
```

## SETUP

Place the **Track sheet** on the table. On the **overlord track** ,
place an orange hero token (the **doom token** ) on the space
corresponding to the number of heroes playing. Place a
purple hero token (the **fate token** ) on the upper space of the
track. Place a fatigue token on the lowest space of the **loot
track.**

The monster groups required are listed on each **Activation
card**. Take all Act I Monster cards and figures for the required
monster groups.

Assemble the **Exploration deck**. Set aside the **starting
encounter** (star in upper left corner). Then set aside the 3
**main encounters** (number in upper left corner).

Shuffle the remaining Exploration cards and deal them into
3 facedown stacks: 2 stacks of 3 cards and 1 stack of 2
cards. Shuffle the ##3 main encounter into the stack that
only has 2 cards and place that stack facedown. Shuffle the
##2 main encounter into one of the other stacks and place
that stack facedown on top of the first stack. Shuffle the
##1 main encounter into the remaining stack and place that
stack facedown on top of the other 2 stacks. The 3 combined
stacks make up the **Exploration deck**.

Shuffle the Activation cards together to make the **Activation
deck** and place it facedown near the Exploration deck.
Shuffle the Peril cards to make the **Peril deck** and place it
facedown near the overlord track.

Shuffle the Search cards from the base game to make the
**Search deck** and place it facedown near the Track sheet.

Separate the Act I and Act II **Shop Item cards** and shuffle
them separately. Place the Act I Shop Item deck facedown
near the loot track. Place the Act II Shop Item deck aside.

Place the starting encounter Exploration card (star in upper
left corner) faceup on the table next to the Exploration deck.
It is now the **active Exploration card**. Use the encounter
guide at the back of the rulebook to set up the encounter.

Sort damage, fatigue, hero, condition tokens and Condition
cards into piles.

**Hero Setup**
Follow the normal hero setup from the base game, however
if there is only 1 player, he or she controls 2 heroes. If there
are 2 or more players, each player controls 1 hero. You make
independent decisions and take separate turns for each hero
you control.

If you use a card or ability from the base game that does not
apply to cooperative play, ignore any part of it that has no
effect on the game.

**Each hero starts the game with 1 XP**. You may spend this
immediately on a Class card or save it for later use.

## ORDER OF PLAY

A **round** consists of the Hero phase and the Overlord phase.

Once the Overlord phase is complete, the round ends and a
new round begins.

## HERO PHASE

```
Each hero takes 1 turn, following the normal steps of a hero
turn. Complete your entire turn before another hero begins
his turn. After all heroes have completed their turns, the
Overlord phase begins.
Each round, the players decide as a group the order in which
each hero activates (it may be different each round). If you
cannot agree, go clockwise starting with a random player.
```
## OVERLORD PHASE

```
All rules regarding Overlord cards and the overlord player
from the base game do not apply in cooperative adventures.
```
## 1. OVERLORD EFF ECTS

```
Follow all Overlord effects printed in the red box of the active
Exploration card , in order from top to bottom.
```
```
When an Overlord effect with an hourglass symbol occurs,
do not immediately resolve the corresponding text. Instead,
place 1 fatigue token next to the symbol.
```
```
After placing a fatigue token, if the number of fatigue
tokens matches the number associated with the symbol, the
corresponding text occurs, and all tokens are removed.
```
```
Continue placing 1 fatigue token during each Overlord phase
for as long as the Exploration card remains active.
```
## 2. FATE

```
If there is an active Exploration card, skip this step.
```
```
Otherwise advance fate by 1 and draw and resolve 1 Peril
card. If the card is divided into 2 sections, do the following:
if there are no monsters on the map, resolve the effect listed
on the top half. If there are 1 or more monsters on the map,
resolve the effect listed on the bottom half. If the card is
not divided into 2 sections, resolve the entire card’s effect.
Finally, discard the Peril card.
```
```
If the Peril deck runs out of cards, immediately shuffle the
discard pile to create a new Peril deck.
```
```
Peril effects do not apply to familiars, figures treated as
heroes, and heroes who are not on the map.
```
## 3. MONSTER ACTIVATION

```
If there are any monsters on the map, draw 1 Activation card :
```
**1. Determine Monster Group**
The order in which monster groups activate is determined by
their location on the Activation card – upper left, upper right,
lower left, then lower right.
Locate the first group in the order that is on the map and has
not yet activated.
**2. Note Active Effects**
Note any active effects for that group (printed in _italics_ under
the name of the group).
**3. Choose a Monster**
If there are yellow and red boxes, **minion** (yellow box) and
**master** monsters (red box) activate separately.

```
Monsters are activated in order from top to bottom; all those
in the top box activating before any in the bottom box.
```
```
Choose 1 monster that has not activated from the top box. If
all monsters of the top box have activated, choose 1 monster
that has not activated from the bottom box.
```
```
If there are no yellow and red boxes, choose any monster of
that group that has not activated.
```
**4. Perform Actions**
Resolve all actions listed for that monster in order, from top
to bottom, repeating the list of actions until that monster has
performed 2 actions or follows the entire list and is unable to
perform a listed action.
**5. Continue/Complete Activation**
If there are monsters of the activating group on the map that
have not yet activated, repeat from step 3.

```
If there are more monsters of a different group that have not
yet activated, repeat from step 1.
```
```
If all monster groups have been activated, discard the
Activation card.
```
## THE OVERLORD TR ACK

```
If a card or effect instructs you to advance fate , move the
fate token down the overlord track.
```
```
If a card or effect instructs you to advance doom , move the
doom token up the overlord track.
```
```
If a card or effect instructs you to move fate backward , move
the fate token up the overlord track. You cannot move the
doom token down the overlord track.
If a card or effect instructs you to refresh fate , move the fate
token to the top space of the overlord track.
```
## ADDITIONAL HERO RULES

## EXPLOR ATION

```
When a hero performs an open a door action, follow these
steps:
```
**1. Draw the top card of the Exploration deck** and place it
faceup on the table. That Exploration card is now **active**. An
active Exploration card defines an encounter’s rules for as
long as the card is active.
**2. Locate the encounter in the encounter guide** (at the
back of the rulebook) and set up the map as shown. Attach
the map so that the entrance of the new encounter is
connected to the exit of the previous encounter. Read aloud
the _italicized_ flavor text under the encounter name. Then
follow any text listed in the corresponding green box of the
encounter guide, placing monsters and tokens as indicated.
**3. Refer to the Exploration card** for all rules regarding the
encounter. Effects in the blue area occur from top to bottom.
Any text that says _After Setup_ occurs immediately after the
encounter has been set up.

```
A hero cannot open a door if there is an active Exploration
card. Doors cannot be closed.
```
## COOPER ATIVE ADVENTURE RULES


## LOOT

**When a hero defeats a monster** , place a number of damage
tokens on the loot track equal to the number of spaces
the monster figure’s base occupied. Each time you place
a damage token, place it on the lowest empty space of the
track.

**If a hero defeats a master monster** , move the fatigue token on
the loot track up 1 space before placing any damage tokens
on the loot track. The fatigue token on the loot track cannot
go past the highest space of the track.

The **loot limit** is set by the number of heroes playing
(represented on the loot track by gray silhouettes). When the
number of damage tokens on the loot track equals the loot
limit, the hero that last placed a damage token on the track
draws a number of Shop Item cards from the current act’s
Shop Item deck equal to the number indicated by the fatigue
token. He gives one of the Shop Item cards to any hero of
his choice and places any remaining cards at the bottom of
the Shop Item deck. Then, he removes all damage tokens
from the loot track and moves the fatigue token back to its
starting position.

Any damage tokens that would be placed above the loot limit
as the result of defeating a monster are ignored.

**At any time during your hero turn, you may flip one of your
hero’s faceup Search cards facedown** (ignoring the effects of
the card); **then add 2 damage tokens to the loot track**.

## HEROIC F EATS

**Heroic feats do not refresh in cooperative play**. Each hero
may only use his heroic feat once per quest.

## TR ANSITION TO ACT II

When an Exploration card instructs players to transition to
Act II, perform the following:

1. Place the Act I Shop Item deck back in the box, and move
    the Act II Shop Item deck next to the loot track. When
    drawing cards for loot, players now draw from the Act II
    Shop Item deck.
2. Replace all Act I Monster cards with Act II Monster cards.
    The new cards apply to monsters currently on the map as
    well as all future monsters.

## ADDITIONAL OVERLORD RULES

## MONSTER ACTIVATION IN HERO TURNS

An Exploration card may cause specific monster groups to
activate after the corresponding encounter is set up, even
though it is not the Overlord phase. To activate monsters
during a hero’s turn, draw an Activation card and activate
only the specified groups, then discard the Activation card.

## SPAWN AND PLACE

If the encounter guide instructs players to **spawn monsters** ,
place monsters on the map based on the number of heroes,
as indicated. If there are 2 heroes, spawn on the spaces
marked 2. If there are 3 heroes, spawn on the spaces marked
2 and 3. If there are 4 heroes, spawn on the spaces marked
2, 3, and 4.

If players cannot spawn a monster because the required
figure is already on the map, remove that figure from the
map, recover all damage and remove any conditions on that
monster, and place it as directed. When players remove
figures from the map in order to spawn monsters for an
encounter, they cannot remove monsters that were just
placed for that encounter. They must remove monsters
that were on the map before the players started spawning
monsters for that encounter.

```
If a peril effect or overlord effect instructs players to place
new monsters on the map and there are not enough figures
to place, place as many figures as possible. When instructed
to place monsters on the map, place master monsters first,
respecting group limits.
```
## MOVEMENT

```
Monsters cannot enter terrain that causes them to suffer
damage during movement.
Activation cards use the following special vocabulary:
```
```
Toward: The figure moves into the target’s space if possible.
Otherwise, it must end its movement in the closest possible
space to the target following normal movement rules. The
figure always takes the route that requires the fewest MPs.
Away: The figure must increase the number of spaces
between it and the target with each space moved. If a figure
cannot do so, it does not move.
Furthest: The target that is the greatest number of spaces
away from the monster.
```
```
Closest: The target that is the fewest number of spaces away
from the monster.
Engage: The monster performs a move action and moves
toward the specified target. If it would not move when
performing this action, this action is not performed.
Spot: The monster performs a move action and moves toward
the closest space from which it would have LOS to the
specified target. If a monster already has LOS to the target, it
does not perform this action. If there is no space on the map
from which the monster could have LOS to the target, the
monster targets a different hero, following the instructions of
that same action while ignoring the hero it cannot target.
```
```
Large Monsters
When determining movement for a large monster, choose 1
space the monster occupies and count movement from that
space as if the figure occupied 1 space. When moving a large
monster toward a target, choose the space occupied by the
large monster that is closest to the target. When moving a
large monster away from a target, choose the space occupied
by the large monster that is furthest from the target. After
moving a large monster toward or away from a target, place
the monster as close to or as far away from the target as
possible, respectively. Otherwise, large monsters follow the
normal movement rules for large monsters.
```
## ENCOUNTERS

```
An encounter consists of all map tiles shown under the
corresponding section of the encounter guide and follows
all rules here and on the respective Exploration card. The
rules of an encounter affect the whole map unless otherwise
stated.
```
```
Main encounters are special encounters that are labeled with
a number on their Exploration card and corresponding section
of the encounter guide. The outcome of one main encounter
will affect the next main encounter, ultimately leading up to
the final main encounter: the Finale.
Heroes gain XPs in the first 2 main encounters. When a hero
gains XPs, he may immediately spend them, along with any
saved XPs, by acquiring new skill cards of his class. You may
save any unspent XPs, but can only spend them immediately
after gaining new XPs.
```
```
The current encounter is the encounter on the active
Exploration card or the most recent active Exploration card.
```
```
Entrances and exits are spaces in each encounter defined in
the encounter guide.
```
```
Overlapping Map Tiles
If map tiles overlap when placing a new encounter, use end
caps to create a hidden passage instead. Connect 1 end
cap to the exit of the previous encounter, place the new
encounter in an open space on the table, and connect a
second end cap to the entrance of the new encounter. The
two end caps are considered linked.
If a figure is on a linked end cap, the figure may spend 1
MP to move to the other linked end cap as if both end cap
spaces were adjacent. If both spaces on the end cap a figure
is moving to are occupied, places it in the closest empty
space to that end cap.
```
```
Monsters and heroes cannot attack through or draw LOS
through linked end caps.
```
## COMBAT

```
When a monster performs an attack, the hero rolling defense
dice also rolls the attack dice for that monster.
```
## SURGES

```
When performing an attack and a monster has to spend,
spend them in the following priority. If the monster spends a
and still has additional to spend, follow the list again
from the beginning. Continue doing this until the monster
cannot spend any more or has none left to spend.
```
**1. Hero Skills:** A monster spends when hero skills, hero
    abilities, and heroic feats require the monster to spend
    to attack.
**2. Range:** A monster spends on additional range if the
    monster cannot hit all of its targets with its current range.
**3. Special:** A monster spends on special abilities only
    when it will have an effect on at least one of the monster’s
    targets. Special surge abilities are all abilities that are not
    _Range_ , _Pierce_ , or _Damage_.
**4. Pierce:** A monster spends on _Pierce_ only when 1 or
    more have been rolled by at least one of the monster’s
    targets.
**5. Damage:** Apply the with the highest bonus first.

## DEF EATED HEROES

```
Each time a hero is defeated, advance fate by 1.
```
## SPECIAL MONSTER RULES

```
Merriods: Flail targets the hero closest to the merriod in
addition to the original target of the attack.
```
```
Merriods and Ettins: If possible, when a monster with Reach
engages a hero, it ends its movement so that its figure is 2
spaces away from the hero and it has LOS to the hero. If not
possible, it engages as normal.
```
```
Hybrid Sentinels and Shadow Dragons: Fire Breath targets as
many heroes as possible. The path cannot be traced through
any monster figures.
```
## WINNING & LOSING

```
If the doom or fate tokens ever occupy the same space on
the overlord track, the heroes immediately fail the quest and
lose the game.
```
```
To win, the heroes must successfully complete the third main
encounter of the quest. Heroes win or lose the game together.
```
