## Factions/Playable Characters or Roles
- Each player starts with a unique ship that has different capabilities in terms of speed, cargo capacity, and combat prowess. However, these differences are not as pronounced as faction differences in some other games, as players can upgrade their ships over time.

## Additional Notes
- The game features a high degree of randomness due to dice rolling and tile drawing, which can lead to different experiences in each playthrough.
- Expansions are available that add new content and mechanics to the base game.
- The game encourages player interaction through trading and combat, but players can also choose to focus on solo activities if they prefer.

# Xia Legends of a Drift System - Rules

[[Xia Legends of a Drift System.pdf]]

XIA: LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM Consolidated Rulebook (v2.0)

This rulebook combines and streamlines the multiplayer and solo rules for the base game of XIA and its expansions: Embers of a Forsaken Star (Embers), Missions & Powers (M&P), and Sellsword. It assumes that you will be using all of the expansions. If you choose not to play with all of the expansion content, you will need to modify the rules accordingly. Note, if you are playing the base game without any expansion content, you are better off using the official XIA rulebook instead of this one. Wherever possible, this rulebook favors updates and clarifications to the base game rules made by the expansions or posted online by the designers.


SETUP	1 OVERVIEW: Become a Legend	2 SHIPS: She may not look like much...	3 OUTFITS: But she’s got it where it counts!	4 NITTY GRITTY: Combat/Damage/Movement	6
PLAYER TURN DETAIL/2-PLAYER VARIANT	8

GAME BOARD: Sectors/Borders	10 CARDS: Titles/Missions/Events	13 CAPITALISM: Cargo Cubes and Credits	15 INHABITANTS OF XIA: Non-Player Ships	16 FLYING SOLO: Campaign Mode	17
INDEX	18




Setup
1. Find the Sector tile ‘Nyr’ and place it face up in the center of the play area. Shuffle the Sector tiles and place them face down in a stack within reach of all players. Deal one Sector tile per player, placing them face up in the center of the play area adjacent to Nyr, matching up the edge symbols to Nyr’s.
•  If a Sector without a Spawn Point (  ) is drawn, re-shuffle it into the deck and draw another tile.

SOLO: Start with the ’Nyr’ sector, then reveal additional sectors until you have at least 2 spawn points and at least 4 sectors total. If you draw the Xia sector, shuffle it back in and redraw. Then, ar-range all the revealed sectors however you like (any configuration).
•  If Kemplar II and/or Loath aren’t already revealed, find them. Add 5 random sectors (hidden), shuffle them together with Kemplar II/Loath face down, and put those 6–7 sectors on top of the unexplored sectors stack (without looking at them).

2. Shuffle the Exploration Tokens (  ) and Relic Tokens and place them face down within reach of all players. Place an Exploration token face down on any Exploration spaces on the starting tiles. (Use only the new Exploration tokens, and none of the base game Exploration tokens.)
3. Shuffle the Title Cards, Mission Cards, and Event Cards. Place the decks face down within reach of all players.

SOLO: Before shuffling, remove the following Titles from the Title deck: Avenger, Generous, Heroic, Benefactor; after shuffling, re-veal one Title that will be available from the beginning of the game. (New Titles are also revealed normally later in the game.)
•  Before shuffling, remove the following Events from the Event deck: Fesko Grand Prix, Change of Heart.

4. Place the Cargo Cubes, Damage/Ice Damage Markers (  ), Outfits (organized by shape), Credits, and Dice within reach of all players. The dice are referred to throughout as   [d6],    [d8],   [d12], and
[d20], where the number represents the number of sides.
5. Give each player one How to Win Card and 4,000 Credits (  ) (4 sil-ver coins).
6. Place The Kiln’s NPC card in the play area and its miniature on the rules space of the Nyr sector tile. Shuffle the three NPC cards and deal one face up to each player. (In a 4- or 5-player game, not eve-ryone will get one.) Players take the corresponding NPC miniature and place it on the NPC card. (Optionally, place the Sellsword card and miniature in the play area. Unlike other NPCs, it is not dealt to a specific player.)

SOLO: In solo play, you must use the Merchant, Enforcer, and Scoundrel (and Sellsword optionally), but don’t deal their cards dur-ing setup.

7. Place the Embers Fame Point Track and the Economy Board in the play area. Players now decide the number of Fame Points (  ) needed for Victory. Place the Victory Marker on the Fame Point Track to indicate the winning total. Determine the number of start-ing cubes for each cube type on the Economy board by rolling the
[d6] for each cube type and placing that number of cubes on that space. (Average playtimes: 5 points ≈ 15 min per player. 10 points ≈ 30 min per player. 20 points ≈ 45 min per player.)

SOLO: Choose the number of Fame Points needed for victory. (In campaign mode, the	needed for victory are determined by the goal you choose.) Start your marker at 0   , along with a single ex-tra color marker to represent the NPCs collectively (they are work-ing together against you). This is called the NPC Fame Point
track marker.

8. Separate the blue Tier 1 (   ) Ship Mats and matching Ability Cards. (Set the green Tier 2 (   ) and purple Tier 3 (   ) mats and cards aside for now.) Each player rolls the   [d20]. The player with the highest roll chooses a Tier	Ship Mat, takes the matching Minia-ture, and chooses one matching Ability Card. This continues coun-ter-clockwise around the table until each player has chosen. All players then place their miniatures on the Spawn Point of the Sec-tor tile closest to them.
9. Each player now takes an Impulse token and a set of markers.
•  The Impulse token is placed on the Impulse space of the Ship Mat face up (yellow side).
•  One Marker is placed on the Fame Point Track at 0 (Unknown).
•  One Marker is placed on the highest number of the Ship Mat’s Energy Meter.
•  The remaining four markers are placed on the Ship Mat, filling out the Armed section.
10. In the same order as ship selection, each player may now spend their Credits to purchase Outfits and Mods, which are placed in their Ship Mat’s Hold. Players may only purchase what will fit in the Hold. Players are not required to spend all or any of their Credits.

SOLO: Spawn your Tier	ship on any spawn point of your choice. Then, spawn NPCs and draw Behavior cards (see NPC Behaviors, pg. 17). Start with 4,000   and purchase Outfits and Mods. Use 2,000   for Hard mode or 6,000   for Easy mode. Easy mode is rec-ommended for new players (see NPC Difficulty Level, pg. 17).
XIA: LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM


OVERVIEW: Become a Legend

Game Overview
Xia is a 1–5 player, sandbox-style competitive space adventure. Each player starts as a lowly (but hopeful!) captain of a small starship.
Players fly their ships around the system, completing a variety of Mis-sions, exploring new Sectors, and battling other ships. Captains vie with each other for Titles, riches, and, most importantly, Fame.
The most adaptive, risk-taking, and creative players will excel. One captain will rise above, surpassing mortality to become a Legend!


Victory
Players achieve Victory through a Fame Point system. Players can earn Fame Points in 9 ways: Exploration, Missions, Trade, Combat, Wealth, Ships, Kindness, Titles, and Luck.
When a player’s Marker on the Fame Point Track reaches the Victory token, the game is over and that player is declared the victor. The winning player receives eternal glory (!) and proceeds to read aloud the Victory Story on the back of his Ship Mat.


First Game
Because of the complexity of Xia, we recommend the following for your first game:
Read all the rules first: You will be much happier!
Play to 5 Fame Points: This will keep the game short and sweet.
Starting Sectors: Use Burning Horse, Kemplar II, Neo Damascus. Add: Outpost 338 (for a 4-player game), and Expedior Gate (for a 5-player game).
Ignore NPCs: Remove the NPCs from the game and ignore all NPC-related cards.

SOLO: Easy Mode: Use Side A of the NPC Stats card (see Non-Player Ships, pg. 16).

Strategies/Outfits: For your first play through, each player should pick one of the following strategy/Outfit combinations. This will ensure that the various mechanisms in the game will come into play, allowing you to learn each facet of the game.
•  Explorer: Buy Raptor-K Engine. Your goal is to explore new Sectors and collect as many Exploration tokens as possible.
•  Trader: Buy M-22 Engine and Targe Shield, then fly to Kemplar II and purchase 2 Spice Cargo Cubes with 1,000 Credits. Fly to Neo Damascus and sell your Cargo Cubes. Use your Shield in case of at-tack.
•  Worker: Buy Halon Engine and Targe Shield. Fly to the nearest Mis-sion Point and Draw Missions. Look for Research and Shuttle Mis-sions to complete.
•  Pirate: Buy M-22 Engine and Saker V Blaster. Attack everything that moves. Focus on ships with Cargo Cubes and/or Bounty.
Some of these strategies may seem stronger than others. However, during regular play, the board layout is random in nature, so you will need to adapt to succeed.

Turn Overview
A player’s turn consists of the following Phases:
1. Action Phase – The Action Phase includes fighting, flying, using Abilities, collecting, trading, and working on/completing Missions. The player will use the inherent abilities of his ship, Outfits he has equipped on his ship, and his bonus abilities from Ability cards to take actions. A player may continue taking actions until he cannot or does not wish to) take further actions. When a player is done taking actions, he may move to the Business Phase.


1. Business Phase – The Business Phase only happens if a player ends his Action Phase on a planet space. The Business Phase includes re-charging/repairing the ship, buying/exchanging Outfits, and pur-chasing a new ship or Fame Points. If the player is not on a planet, the Business Phase is skipped.
2. Status Phase – During this phase, the player rearms his markers, refreshes Abilities and Impulse, draws Titles, counts Fame Points, and possibly claims victory!

SOLO:
3. System Expanse – Immediately after the end of each of your turns, before any NPC turns, reveal a new sector.
4. NPC Phase – During this phase, resolve NPC(s) actions based on their selected behavior cards.
5. End of Round – Immediately after all of the NPC turns, but before resolving events, you must advance the NPC Fame Point track marker.

Once a phase has started, a player cannot go back to a previous phase (Ex. You cannot start your Business Phase and then go back to the Action Phase). After the Status Phase is completed, the player’s turn is over.


Fame Fame Point Track
At the beginning of the game, players place one of their markers on the Fame Point Track at “0 – Unknown.” As you claim Fame Points, you advance your Marker up the Fame Point Track. Victory is achieved when your Marker reaches the Victory token. In the Embers expansion track, pink Event spaces show you when to draw Event cards.
•  Variable Game Length: At the beginning of the game, players de-cide the number of Fame Points needed for Victory by placing the Victory token on the Fame Point Track at that number. Players can decide to play a shorter game with fewer Fame Points, or a longer game with more Fame Points.
How to Earn Fame Points
There are a variety of ways that players can gain Fame Points:
•  Explore: Players may discard 2 Exploration tokens for 1  . (Adven-turous pilots can earn a name for themselves exploring new Sectors.)
•  Missions: Each Mission completed is worth 1  . (Earn a reputation by doing jobs.)
•  Combat: Destroying another ship is worth a number of Fame Points equal to the destroyed ship’s tier number. (Become known for your fierce prowess.)
•  Trade: Selling all the Cargo Cubes in a ship’s Hold is worth 1  . However, you must sell a minimum of 2 Cargo Cubes to receive the Fame Point. (A clever capitalist can be as famous as a vicious pirate.)
•  Ships: Purchasing a new ship during the Business Phase earns the player 1  . (A ship directly correlates to one’s status.)
•  Wealth: Players may purchase* 1 Fame Point during their Business Phase for 5,000  . (Money can buy a great deal.)
* You may not purchase the final Fame Point needed for Victory.
•  Kindness: Give Energy to a stranded player for 1  . (A ship in need is fame indeed.)
•  Titles: Claiming Titles is worth 1–3  . The amount is stated on the Title card. (A Title is a mark of fame.)
•  Luck: Whenever* a player rolls a natural** 20, for any of their [d20] rolls, they receive 1  . (Tales of your extraordinary exploits
will spread.)
* Maximum once per turn.
** The die shows a 20, before any modifiers are applied.
•  Events: Players may draw Event cards that will grant Fame Points. (Deep space is like a box of chocolates.)
•  Relics: Players may sift a Relic token for 1  . (Recovering ancient artifacts is sure to earn acclaim.)

Consolidated Rulebook


SHIPS: She may not look like much...

Ship Overview
Ships are the player’s in-game representation. Each ship has a Ship Mat, Miniature, and Ability card.
Miniatures occupy one space on the game board at a time. Ship Mats are set face up in front of their owners and contain valuable infor-mation. Ability cards allow players to perform unique and powerful actions.


Miniatures
Each ship Miniature is placed on a flight stand that takes up one space on the game board.
Ships are moved around the board by Engines, Impulse, and Abilities.
No more than one ship may occupy a single space on the board at a time. However, ships may move through occupied spaces.


Ability Cards
Each ship has two unique Ability cards. Abilities are powers that help the player in a unique way.
Use: The top of each Ability card specifies how the Ability is used (Ex. As an Action, or as Defense). To use the Ability, the player spends the Energy specified on the Ability card and then follows the directions on that card. Most Abilities require the player to roll a   [d20].
Exhaust: Directly after an Ability has been used, the card is flipped face down. It is Exhausted and cannot be used again until it is re-freshed. Some Abilities are Exhausted before their effects take place. (Ex. A player uses the Auto-Pilot Ability as an Action, and rolls the   [d20]. The card is now Exhausted, but the effect, moving spaces after other play-er’s turns, is not applied until after his turn is over.)
Refresh: During the Status Phase of a player’s turn, all his Ability cards are Refreshed. Some Abilities (like Auto-Pilot in the example above) are Refreshed before their effects take place. Flip them face up to indicate they are ready for use again (see Status Phase, pg. 9).
New Ship: When a player purchases a new ship, he will retain the Abil-ity cards from all previously owned ships. (Ex. When a player reaches a Tier	ship, his ship will have 3 Ability cards.)
Read each Ability card for more details.


Ship Mats
The Ship Mat is placed face up in front of the player who owns the ship. The Ship Mat contains information about the player’s ship.
Displayed on the front of the Ship Mat are: 1.  Name
This is the name of the ship.
2.  Tier
Ships are either Tier   ,   , or   .
3.  Hologram
This is an image of the ship.
4.  Price/Hold Size
•  The Price of a ship is the amount of Credits a player has to pay to purchase the ship.
•  Hold Size is a quick reference for the number of spaces in the Hold.
5. Impulse Space/Value
The Impulse space is where the Impulse token is placed. The Im-pulse Value represents the number of spaces a ship may move without spending Energy (see Movement, pg. 7).
6.  Hold
The Hold represents the physical capacity of the ship.


7.  Energy Meter
This meter keeps track of the ship’s Energy.
8. Armed/Disarmed Spaces
Armed spaces are used to hold markers that are currently ready to be spent on Outfits. Disarmed spaces hold markers that are wait-ing to be Armed.
9. Bounty
Bounty Credits are placed here.

—
Displayed on the back of the Ship Card are:
10. Ship Technical Information
The ship’s statistics are listed here. These have no bearing on the game mechanics, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t important!
11. Backstory
The ship’s backstory is located here. Read this when you first pur-chase a ship to learn about its history.
12. Victory Story
This tale is meant to be read after the ship obtains Victory. It is in-tended to be read aloud to others so they may bask in your glory!


Hold
The Hold is the ship’s cargo grid which represents the physical capacity of the ship. Outfits and Cargo Cubes are kept in the Hold. Each ship has a unique layout of Hold spaces. Players will need to arrange Out-fits in the Hold to maximize the use of space. A player may not have more Cargo Cubes or Outfits than she has space for in their Hold.
Damage: When a ship takes damage, Damage markers (  ) are placed into the Hold, 1    per space. A damaged space cannot be used, and cannot have an Outfit placed on it. If a ship takes damage equal to or exceeding the number of Hold spaces, the ship is destroyed. After a ship is destroyed, all Damage markers are removed before the ship Respawns (see Damage, pg. 7).
Repairs: During the Business Phase of a player’s turn, she may pay to Repair her ship, completely removing all Damage markers. Repairs for Tier	and Tier	ships cost 1,000  , and Tier	ships cost 2,000  .


Energy Meter
A ship’s Energy is a rechargeable resource. Energy is spent to arm markers, use Abilities, and scan new Sector tiles.
Spending: To spend Energy, a player simply moves his Marker down the Energy Meter the number of spaces required.
Recharging: During the Business phase, if a player is on a planet, he may replenish his Energy for free. The player moves his Marker up to the maximum number on his Energy Meter.
Stranded: If a player has no Energy and no Armed markers, he is Stranded. A stranded player cannot do anything except move their ship’s Impulse Value and take (Minor) Actions (see Stranded, pg. 8).


Impulse Token
This double-sided token is used to keep track of when a player has used his Impulse.
Using: At the start of a player’s turn, the Impulse token should be face up (yellow-side up) on the Ship Mat. When Impulse is used to take a Move action, the token should be flipped face down. The facedown token indicates that Impulse is now Exhausted and cannot be used again until it is Refreshed.
Refresh: During a player’s Status Phase, he will Refresh his Impulse token by flipping it face up.

XIA: LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM



Visual Aids
Xia comes with two types of visual aids that are not required, but can help players clearly visualize key points of information.
Color Tokens: Color tokens are used to help differentiate ships on the board. These can be placed on your miniature’s flight stand, sliding over the thin part of the flight post to lock onto the thicker part of the base. Players should take the color that matches their set of markers.
Outlaw Token: Outlaw tokens are used to mark Outlaw ships on the game board. They can be slid over the thin part of the flight stand post, then set down to lock onto the thicker part of the base. These tokens are to be used to denote when a ship has a Bounty on it, and is therefore an Outlaw.


Bounty
There are certain illegal acts that will earn a player a Bounty (  ) of Credits on her Ship Mat. Having a Bounty is a sign that the ship is wanted for illegal acts. A Bounty should remain separate from a play-er’s earned Credits – place the Bounty Credits on the “Bounty” section of the Ship Mat. Ships can be classified as one of the following:
Innocent: Ships without any Bounty are considered Innocent.
Outlaw: Ships with Bounty are considered Outlaw ships. Outlaw ships may not enter Lawful Planets via their Entrance.
Players will accrue Bounty for:
•  Evading: Whenever a player crosses through a Planetary Shield instead of using the legal Planetary Entrance, there is a chance that her Bounty will increase by 1,000  .
•  Crime: Illegal Missions specify a Bounty for either completing or failing the Mission (details included on the Mission card).
•  Raiding: Destroying an Innocent ship will increase a player’s Boun-ty by 1,000  .

SOLO:
•  Attacking: Each time the Merchant or Enforcer is attacked by the player or Sellsword, that ship gets +1,000   Bounty (in addition to any Bounty earned by destroying the NPC).
•  Visiting Outlaw Planets: Each time your ship enters an outlaw planet using the planetary entrance, your bounty increases by 1,000  , even if you were already an outlaw.

Other rules for Bounty:
•  Claiming: When a ship with a Bounty is destroyed by another ship, all Credits in the destroyed ship’s Bounty area are immediately claimed by the attacking ship. However, if the attacking ship is also destroyed, the Bounty is unclaimed and is simply discarded.
•  Removing: If a ship has a Bounty, the Bounty is removed if the ship is destroyed or the player purchases a new ship.

SOLO:
•  Player Bounty Carry Over: When you upgrade your ship, any boun-ty carries over to the new ship. Your bounty only goes away if your ship is destroyed.


Buy New Ship
During a player’s Business Phase, he may purchase a ship that is exact-ly one tier higher than his current ship.
To purchase a new ship, a player spends a number of Credits equal to the price displayed on the new ship’s Ship Mat. Once purchased, the old Ship Mat and Miniature are replaced by the new Ship Mat and Min-iature. The old Ship Mat and Miniature are set aside for the rest of the game. However, all previous Ability cards are kept, and all Outfits, Cargo Cubes, and Credits from the previous ship are transferred to the new ship’s Hold. Damage and Bounty* are not transferred.
*See Bounty, pg. 4, for the alternate Solo Player Bounty Carry-Over rule.

OUTFITS: But she’s gotitwhereitcounts!

Outfits Overview
Outfits are the primary focus of the Action Phase. Players use Outfits to move, defend, and attack with their ship. Outfits come in four types: Engines, Shields, Blasters, and Missiles. Engines are used for movement, Shields for protection, and Blasters and Missiles for attack-ing other ships. Each type of Outfit comes in 3 tiers. The tiers go from cheap, small, and weak to expensive, big, and powerful.
Each Outfit contains:
1.  Name/Type: The name of the Outfit. (Ex. Saker V, type Blaster)
2.  Price: How many Credits the player must spend to purchase the Outfit. (Ex. 2,000   for the Blaster.)
3.  Die: The die that is rolled when resolving an action using that Out-fit. (Ex. d8 is an 8-sided die.)
4.  Use Spaces: Where Armed markers are placed when using the Out-fit to take an action. Use spaces limit how many times the Outfit may be used in a turn. (Ex. The Blaster, with 2 Use spaces, may be used twice in one turn)
5.  Sections: Outfits are divided into sections by white dashed lines. Each Section takes up one Hold space, and may hold one Damage Marker. (Ex. The Blaster has 4 sections, and therefore takes up 4 Hold spaces, and can hold up to 4 Damage markers.)

Outfits Detail
Outfits in the Hold: Each Section of an Outfit takes up one space in the Hold. Weaker Outfits are smaller, while the more powerful Outfits are larger. Outfits do not have to be “right-side up” in the Hold, and therefore can take a variety of positions. Ships may only hold Outfits if there is enough space in the Hold. Players will need to be creative to fit certain configurations of Outfits in their Hold.
Order: Players can activate Outfits in any order (Ex. A player may use an Engine, then a Blaster, then another Engine). A player may use any, all, or none of his Outfits during the Action Phase of his turn.
Using: During a player’s Action Phase, he may spend any of his Armed markers to use any of his Outfits. To use an Outfit, a player moves the Marker from the Armed space on the Ship Mat to a Use space on the Outfit being used. The player then rolls the corresponding die for that Outfit. The action is then completed by resolving the die roll.
Arming: During a player’s Status Phase, he may move Disarmed or Used markers to Armed spaces of his Ship Mat. Arming costs 1 Energy per Marker. If the player has no Energy, he may not arm any markers.
Use Spaces: Players may spend their Armed markers on any available Use spaces of an Outfit to use it. An available Use space is one without markers or Damage on it. If an Outfit does not have any available Use spaces, then it cannot be used (Ex. This Tier	Blaster has been used twice this turn and cannot be used again).
Purchasing: Outfits can be purchased during a player’s Business Phase for the price listed on the Outfit. You must be able to fit an Outfit in your ship’s Hold in order to purchase it, no other restrictions apply.
Rearranging: A player may rearrange his Outfits in the Hold during the Business Phase of his turn. Outfits with Damage markers cannot be rearranged; they must first be repaired.
Selling: Outfits can be sold during the Business Phase of a player’s turn. Outfits are sold for half of their cost, rounded up (Tier	Outfits sell for 1,000   ; Tier	Outfits for 1,000   ; Tier	Outfits for 2,000  ). Damaged Outfits cannot be sold; they must first be repaired.
Damage: Damage markers can be placed on any Section of an Outfit. Damage markers placed on an Outfit cause that Outfit to become less effective. Use spaces that have Damage cannot be used. In addition, each Damage Marker on an Outfit reduces its roll by 1. (Ex. A Player activates a Tier	Engine with 1 Damage Marker (  ) on it. He rolls a d6 and receives a 4. Because of the   , this counts as rolling a 3.)

Markers are used to keep track of Fame and Energy. They are also spent to use Outfits. At the start of the game, each player places one Marker on the Fame Point Track, another on the Energy Meter, and the last four on the Ship Mat on the spaces marked “Armed.”
Outfits: Each ship holds 4 markers that can be Armed and subse-quently spent to use Outfits. These 4 markers are kept separate from the Marker keeping track of Energy.
Spending: To spend a Marker, the player moves one Marker from an Armed space on the Ship Mat to a Use space on an Outfit. The player then rolls the corresponding die for that Outfit and resolves the roll.
Arming: During the Status Phase, a player may spend Energy to rearm markers at a cost of one Energy per Marker. A player can arm as many markers as she desires, up to the maximum of 4. To Arm, the player simply moves her Energy Marker down one space and moves the cho-sen Marker to an Armed space on her Ship Mat.
•  Special Rules: Re-arm may be used by a defending ship during an Attack action (see Combat, pg. 6). Markers can also be Armed im-mediately after being Rescued (see Stranded, pg. 8).
Disarmed: During the Status Phase, any markers that have not been Armed are placed on Disarmed spaces. After the Status Phase, no markers should be left on Outfits.


Engines
During a player’s Action Phase, that player may use an Engine Outfit to take a Move action, following the steps outlined in the Action Phase section of the rulebook (see pg. 8). The number rolled on the die cor-responds to the number of spaces the player may move her Miniature on the board. Players do not have to use all rolled movement, but any unused movement is discarded (see Movement, pg. 7).
Ramming: Engines may be used in a desperate situation to take an Attack action against an adjacent ship. (This action is separate from a Movement action, which cannot be used to ram another ship.) Ram-ming has a Range of 1 space and requires Line of Sight. The player follows the steps outlined in the Combat section (see pg. 6). The at-tack is carried out similar to any other attack, with the exception that Damage dealt is also applied to the attacking ship. The damage to the attacking ship is Unblockable, while the target ship is free to use Shields or Defensive Abilities. Also, the attack always does full damage to the attacker, no matter how much damage the target takes (even if the target is destroyed). If the attacker combines ramming with other attacks, only the ramming damage is applied to the attacker. (Impulse cannot be used for ramming.)


Blasters/Missiles
Blasters: May be used during the Action Phase to take an Attack ac-tion against a nearby ship. Blasters have a Range of 1 space and re-quire Line of Sight. After determining Range and Line of Sight, the player follows the steps outlined in the Combat section of the rule-book (see pg. 6). The number rolled on the die corresponds to the amount of damage done to the target ship in Damage markers.
Missiles: May be used during the Action Phase to take an Attack action against a ship at a distance. Missiles have a Range of 2–6 spaces and require Line of Sight. After determining Range and Line of Sight, the player follows the steps outlined in the Combat section of the rule-book (see pg. 6). The number rolled on the die corresponds to the amount of damage done to the target ship in Damage markers. Play-ers cannot use Missiles to attack adjacent ships; the targeted ship must be at least 2 spaces away.

Shields
Shields are the only Outfits that can be used outside of a player’s own Action Phase. Shields can be used to prevent incoming damage when another player’s ship (or an NPC ship) attacks. The defending player declares how many Armed markers he is spending on the Shield Outfit during the third step of Combat (see Combat, pg. 6). The number rolled on the dice corresponds to the amount of damage absorbed by the Shields. If the Shields roll is equal to or greater than the incoming damage, no damage is taken.
Special Rules: Shields can protect a player from more than just combat damage. Players may use Shield Outfits to prevent damage from As-teroid Fields and Energy loss from Nebulae.
•  Asteroid Field Damage: Immediately after rolling Damage from an Asteroid Field, a player may use his Shield Outfits as outlined above to try to prevent any of that damage. This works for Aster-oid Borders and Mining.
•  Nebula Energy Loss: Immediately after rolling Energy loss from a Nebula, a player may use his Shield Outfits as outlined above to try to prevent that Energy loss; treat the Energy loss as Damage for these calculations. This works for Nebula Borders and Harvesting.
•  Unblockable: Shields do not help defend against Planetary Shields, Debris Fields, Stars, or other Unblockable Damage.
•  Combat Re-Arm: Immediately after defending from an attack, markers spent on Shields for that Attack action can be re-armed at a cost of 1 Energy per Marker (see Combat, pg. 6).


Mods
Mods are special 1x1 sized Outfits that have special abilities. As with normal Outfits, if the Mod takes damage, it stops functioning until the damage is repaired. Mods can be stored in the Hold at any time, (though some are only usable when attached to, or on top of an Out-fit) and can be rearranged, sold and transferred to a new ship as per the base game rules.
Enviro-Shld (Environmental Shield)
Placed over a Use space on a Shield Outfit. This space continues to be a Use space for that Shield Outfit, but also gains the following:
Activate: When you activate an Enviro-Shield, the Shield Outfit auto-matically rolls its maximum value vs. noncombat Damage or Energy loss (e.g. from Borders or actions like Mine, Harvest, Quarry, etc.). Enviro-Shields do not affect combat damage (roll normally).
Example: You take a Mining action and roll an 8 – you are about to take 8 Non-Combat Damage. You spend an Armed Marker on an Enviro-Shield on top of your d6 Shield Outfit. You automatically roll 6 for that shield. 8 Non-Combat Damage − 6 Shields = 2 Total Damage taken.
GTS (Gravitational Thrust Stabilizers) Placed in the Cargo Hold.
Each GTS orthogonally adjacent to an Engine Outfit increases that Engine’s rolls by +2 to all rolls with this Outfit. However, the roll may never exceed the maximum die roll for that Outfit.
Example 1: You have a Tier	Engine with 1 GTS adjacent in the Hold. You activate the engine to take a move action and roll a 2, the GTS makes it a 4. You activate the Engine again and roll a 5 – the GTS makes it a 6 (cannot increase beyond the maximum roll for that dice).
Example 2: You have a Tier	Engine that has 1 Damage on it with 1 GTS adjacent in the Hold. You activate the Engine to take a move action and roll a 2, the damage reduces the roll to a 1, then the GTS increases it to a 3. You activate the Engine again and roll a 6, the damage makes it a 5, then the GTS makes it a 6 (cannot increase beyond the maximum roll).
M-Comp (Mission Computer) Placed in the Cargo Hold.
Every undamaged M-Comp in your Hold allows you to carry +2 Active Missions. If your M-Comp is damaged you must discard active Missions down to your current available number of active Missions.
Example: You take the Draw Missions action while having 1 undamaged M-Comp in your Hold, you’ll draw 3 Missions (same as normal). When choosing to keep Missions (which has been moved to after your turn, see the “Mission Drawing/Discarding” section), you’d be able to keep up to 3 Missions (1 normal + 2 for the M-Comp).

XIA: LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM



Piercer (Shield Piercer)
Placed over a Use space on a Blaster/Missile Outfit, this space contin-ues to be a Use space for that Outfit, but also gains the following:
Activate: When you make an attack using a Shield Piercer, shields rolled against it are reduced by −4. This ability can stack with multiple Piercers, but cannot reduce defensive value below 0.
Example 1: You make an attack by placing two markers: one on the regular Use space of a d6 Blaster, and one on a Piercer attached to the same d6 Blaster. Your opponent defends with 1d8 Shields. You roll 1 and 3, your opponent rolls 3. Your Piercer reduces your opponent’s Shield Defense: 3 − 4 = 0 (cannot go below 0) total Defense value. You can now assign Damage as normal: 4 Attack − 0 Defense = 4 Damage.
Example 2: You make an attack by placing two markers on 2 Piercers at-tached to a d6 Blaster, and your opponent defends with 2d8 Shields. You roll 4 and 1, for 5 total Attack, your opponent rolls 7 and 4, for 11 total Shields. Your 2 Piercers reduce your opponent’s Shield Defense: 11 − 8 = 3 total Defense value. You can now assign Damage as normal: 5 Attack − 3 Defense = 2 Damage.


Cargo Pod/Armor Plating
These Outfits are unique because only one space of the Outfit actually sits inside the Cargo Hold (the green space with the white arrow on it); the rest of the Outfit sits outside the Hold, adding additional spaces to your ship. Multiple of these Outfits cannot overlap outside the Hold.
•  Cargo Pod
All 4 spaces of the Cargo Pod can only hold Cargo Cubes and Relic tokens. Only the space that connects to the ship’s Hold may be damaged. The three spaces outside of the ship’s Hold cannot hold Damage markers. If the connecting space is damaged, all spaces within the Cargo Pod are also treated as damaged (and any Cargo there is Jettisoned). The Cargo Pod won’t be able to hold any Car-go until the damage is repaired. Relic tokens must be stored en-tirely inside the Cargo Pod (not half in the Hold, half in the Pod).
•  Armor Plating
Each space on the Armor Plating Outfit can hold 1 Damage (and only damage). This Outfit increases your ship’s durability and al-lows you to take more damage than normal before your ship is de-stroyed. Ice Damage will only spread via the green connection space to/from the Armor Plating.


NITTY GRITTY: Combat/Damage/Movement

Combat
Strike fear into your foes through Combat! Destroy ships for Fame, collect Bounties, recover and sell any Cargo Cubes that are dropped, and take on Assassin or Bounty Hunter Missions!
Combat is carried out in six steps:
1. Acquire Target: The attacker must first determine if he can actual-ly attack the target ship:
•  Range: Range is counted from the Attacking ship to the De-fending ship in spaces on the game board. Blasters have a Range of 1 space and can therefore only target adjacent ships. Missiles have a Range of 2–6 spaces. Some Abilities can be used as attacks; the Ability card will specify the Range of these at-tacks. If the target is within Range, the attacker must then de-termine if he has Line of Sight.
•  Line of Sight: A ship is within Line of Sight if a straight line can be drawn from the center of the attacking ship’s space to the center of the target ship’s space without crossing through an impenetrable Border. The Impenetrable Borders are: Asteroids, Debris Fields, Stars, and Planetary Shields/Entrances. A player also cannot acquire Line of Sight through any space that has not been explored. If the attacker is within Range and has a clear Line of Sight, he may proceed to Declare Attack.

2.  Declare Attack: The attacker declares his target(s) and how many Outfits and/or Abilities he is using for the Attack action. The at-tacker then spends any required Armed markers/Energy at this time. Players can combine offensive attacks into one attack or spread them out into separate attacks. (Ex. A player using 2 Armed markers on a Blaster Outfit could make a single attack on a ship, attack two different ships with each one, or attack the same ship twice.)
3.  Declare Defense: Any ships being attacked are now given the chance to use Shield Outfits and/or Abilities as Defense. The De-fender(s) spends any required Armed markers/Energy at this time. If Shields or Abilities are not declared now, they can’t be used after the Damage Roll.
4.  Roll: All participants now roll the dice associated with the Outfits/ Cargo Cubes Abilities they declared during Steps 2 and 3 of this Combat. The Attacker rolls first, followed by the Defender(s).
5.  Resolve: Add up the dice rolls of the Attacker and add in any Abili-ties – this is the Attack Value. Add up the dice rolls of the Defender and add in any Abilities – this is the Defense Value. Subtract the Defense Value from the Attack Value to calculate the Damage taken by the Defender (see Damage, pg. 7). In the case of multiple defenders, each defender Resolves the Attack separately.
6.  Re-Arm: Defenders who have spent Armed markers on Shield Out-fits during Step 3 may immediately re-arm any of those spent markers at a cost of 1 Energy per Marker. Re-Armed markers are placed on Armed spaces. Any markers that are not Re-Armed are placed on Disarmed spaces. This does not apply to markers spent in previous actions.
After the Defender(s) assign the Damage and Re-Arm, the Attack ac-tion is over.


Combat Example
1. Acquire Target: Puddle Jumper checks if he can attack Gaiden. Gaiden is at Range 1, which allows him to use his Blaster. There is a Nebula Border between them, but that does not affect Line of Sight, so he can proceed with the Attack.
2. Declare Attack: Puddle Jumper declares he is attacking Gaiden with his Blaster twice, spending two markers in one Attack.
3. Declare Defense: Gaiden declares he is defending with his ship’s Evasive Thrusters Ability and his Shield, spending one Marker to use the latter (he could have spent up to three to increase his de-fense even more).
4.  Roll: Both players roll their dice.
•  Puddle Jumper rolls one   [d6] for each Marker placed on the Blaster Outfit’s Use spaces (two dice). Puddle Jumper gets a 6 and a 5, for a total Attack Value of 11.
•  Gaiden rolls one   [d8] for each Marker placed on his Shield Outfit’s Use spaces, and a   [d20] for his ship’s Ability (Evasive Thrusters). He gets a 3 on the Shield, and a success for the Abil-ity roll (which, according to the Evasive Thrusters Ability card, prevents 5 Damage) for a total Defense Value of 8.
5.  Resolve: The Defense Value (8) is subtracted from the Attack Val-ue (11), for a remainder of 3. Gaiden must place 3 Damage markers (  ) in his Hold on spaces of his choosing. Gaiden has decided to place all three   on empty spaces.
6.  Re-Arm: Gaiden now chooses to spend one Energy to arm the Marker used on the Shield Outfit.
The Attack action is now over.


Damage
Damage markers (  ) keep track of how much damage a ship has sus-tained. When a ship has taken too much damage, the ship is destroyed.
Taking Damage: Each   represents 1 point of Damage. The player receiving the damage chooses where to place the   s in her ship’s Hold. Each   takes 1 Hold space. Any Hold space with a    is unusable until repaired (see Business Phase, pg. 8).



6
Consolidated Rulebook



If a card says to “take 1 Damage”, it’s assumed to be regular damage, unless otherwise specified, e.g. “take 1 Ice Damage” (the same goes for healing). If an effect allows you to prevent damage, it can prevent regular or Ice Damage but not Energy loss, unless otherwise specified.
Cubes: If the space where the   is being placed contains a Cargo Cube, the Cube is immediately Jettisoned (set on the board on the same space as the ship) where it can be picked up by any player’s ship.
Use Space: If the   is placed on a Use space of an Outfit, any markers are immediately moved to a Disarmed space, and the Use space is no longer usable until repaired.
Outfits: Damage markers can be placed on any Section of an Outfit. Each Section of the Outfit can hold one   . Damage markers on an Outfit cause that Outfit to become less effective. Each   placed on an Outfit reduces rolls by 1 (Ex. A Blaster Outfit with 2   rolls a 5; this counts as a 3 because of the 2   ). Damage markers on an Outfit affect rolls only for that Outfit. Outfits are not destroyed when they are fully covered by Damage markers; they are simply unusable until repaired.
Destroyed: When a ship has received   equal to or in excess of its number of Hold spaces, the ship is immediately destroyed.
NPCs: NPC ships have a slightly different Damage system (see Non-Player Ships, pg. 16).


Ice Damage Ice Damage (blue gems)
Ice Damage counts as normal damage with the following exceptions:
Melting: During your Business Phase you may remove all Ice Damage for free (must be on a planet or docked to a space station to take a Business Phase).
Freezing: During your Status Phase, place 1 Ice Damage in every space that is orthogonally adjacent to Ice Damage. If, due to freezing, your Hold is entirely full of   s (Ice Damage and/or regular damage) your ship is destroyed. When freezing, spaces with regular   s should be ignored; Ice Damage does not spread into spaces with regular damage.


Death
Death: If a ship is destroyed, it is immediately removed from the game board and placed on its owner’s Ship Mat. All active Missions are dis-carded, all Cargo Cubes are dropped in the space where the ship was destroyed (exception: all Cargo Cubes dropped in Star spaces are de-stroyed), and all Bounty is removed (either collected by destroyer or discarded). If it was that player’s turn, the turn ends immediately.
Reset: Once destroyed, the ship is reset to full Energy, all markers are Armed, all Damage markers are removed, and any Ability cards are refreshed.
Nuances: Players do not lose their Ship, Outfits, Credits, Fame, etc. Only Active Missions and Cargo Cubes are lost.
Dying While Ramming: If both the Attacker and Defender are de-stroyed during a Ramming Attack, the Attacker does not receive any-thing for the kill: no Bounty is collected, and no Fame Points are awarded.


Respawn
After death, at the start of their next turn, the player (or NPC) must first Respawn.
Respawn: To Respawn, roll the   [d20] and place the ship on the unoc-cupied Spawn Point (  ) with the number closest to the number rolled. In the case of a tie, place the ship on the higher-numbered Spawn Point. On a roll of 20, the player may choose which unoccupied Spawn Point to place the ship (in addition to the 1   for “Luck”).
If a Spawn Point is currently occupied, disregard it for the purpose of determining where to Respawn.

Take Damage: Immediately after Respawning, the player takes a set amount of Damage (Unblockable) depending on her tier of ship.
•  Tier	ships respawn with 1 Damage
•  Tier    ships respawn with 2 Damage •  Tier    ships respawn with 3 Damage
Take Turn: After sustaining damage, the player (or NPC) takes a turn.
Example:
•  Player 1 turn – Player 1 dies in Tier	ship; turn ends immediately. •  Player 2 turn
•  Player 3 turn – Player 2 dies in Tier	ship.
•  Player 1 turn – Respawn, sustain 1 point of damage, take turn. •  Player 2 turn – Respawn, sustain 3 points of damage, take turn. •  Player 3 turn, etc.


Movement
Move Actions: Both Engine Outfits and the ship’s Impulse value (listed on its Ship Mat) can be used to take Move actions.
Movement: Players gain Movement by taking a Move action. Move-ment may be spent to move the ship. Each point of Movement moves a ship one space on the game board. When taking a Move action, play-ers do not have to spend all the movement. However, any unspent movement is discarded when the Move action ends.
•  (Minor) Actions: A player may take Minor actions without ending a Move action. In this way a player may move, take a (Minor) Action, then continue moving. (Minor) Actions can be found in the Action Phase section (see pg. 8).
Impulse: Impulse allows a player to move without spending Energy or using their Armed markers. To use Impulse, the player declares a Move action, flips their Impulse token face down (yellow-side down), and moves a number of spaces up to the Impulse value. Impulse may only be used once per turn. The Impulse token is refreshed (placed face up) during the Status Phase.
Engine Outfits: Engine Outfits are the primary means of moving around the board. To use an Engine, the player declares a Move action with the Engine Outfit. The player spends 1 Armed Marker, placing it on a free Use space of that Engine. The player rolls the associated die (displayed on the Outfit). The player may then proceed to move spac-es up to the result of the roll, minus any Damage markers present on the Outfit in use.
Other Ships: A ship may move through spaces occupied by other ships (space is infinitely huge!). However, a ship may not end its movement in an occupied space (well, space isn’t that big...).
Borders: There are nine types of Borders on the game board, each with its own set of rules for movement (see Borders, pg. 10).
Abilities: Some Ability cards grant extra movement or allow for special movement. Read each Ability card for more details.
Using Occupied Spaces: A player may take action(s) on an adjacent space that is currently occupied by another ship, by first spending 2 movement (movement only needs to be spent for the first action). In this scenario, the player would not move their ship from its space, but they can perform an action as though their ship was on the occupied space. (Ex. A player wishing to use an occupied Sell space takes an Impulse Move action, granting 4 movement. She uses two of those to move adja-cent to the occupied space. She then spends the remaining two movement to “use” the adjacent, occupied space, immediately taking a Sell action to Sell her Cargo Cubes as if she was on the space.) Players must still roll for any Borders passed through when using an occupied space.

XIA: LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM



Stranded
A player who has no Energy and no Armed markers is Stranded. A Stranded player may only use Impulse engines for movement; he may take no other normal actions. However, Stranded players may still take (Minor) Actions.
Unstranded: A player becomes Unstranded when he gains 1 or more Energy or Arms markers, or by being Rescued, Recharging at a planet, or collecting an Exploration token with Movement or Energy.
Rescue a Stranded Player: A player may Rescue another player who is Stranded. The rescuer must be adjacent to the Stranded player and have at least 3 Energy. As a Rescue action, the rescuer transfers 2 En-ergy to the Stranded player. The Stranded player cannot refuse.
The rescuer reduces his Energy Meter by two, and the Stranded player increases his Energy Meter by two. The rescuer then receives 1 Fame Point (  ). The Unstranded player may immediately Arm markers with his newly received Energy.
Nebulae: Nebulae can cause Energy loss, leaving a ship stranded. If a ship is Stranded while taking a Move action, that Move action ends immediately.


PLAYER TURN DETAIL

1. Action Phase
During their Action Phase, players take actions. To take an action, the player:
•  Declares the action they are taking;
•  Spends any required Energy or Armed markers and Rolls any asso-ciated dice; and
•  Resolves the action.
Example: Player 1 first declares he will take a Move action using his Engine Outfit. He spends an Armed Marker on his Engine and rolls the correspond-ing die, getting a 5. He then resolves the action by moving his ship 5 spaces on the game board. The action is now over, and the player may take anoth-er action or move to the next Phase.)
The player may continue to take actions until he decides not to, or he is unable to take further actions.
The available actions (each of which is described in more detail else-where) are:
Move (see Movement, pg. 7)
•  Engines: Armed markers can be spent on Engine Outfits to move.
•  Impulse: A player’s Impulse token can be used to move spaces equal to the ship’s Impulse.
Attack (see Combat, pg. 6)
•  Blasters: Armed markers can be spent on Blaster Outfits to attack. •  Missiles: Armed markers can be spent on Missile Outfits to attack. •  Ram: Armed markers can be spent on Engine Outfits to attack.
Missions (see Missions Overview, pg. 13)
•  Draw Missions (Minor): A player on a Mission Point may draw Mis-sion cards. This action may not be taken if the player has a current Active Mission.
•  Mission Objectives: A player may complete the objectives stated on her Active Mission card.
•  Complete a Mission: A player may turn in her completed Mission for payment at the final Mission Point shown on the card.
Cargo Cubes (see Cargo Cubes, pg. 15)
•  Buy Cargo Cubes: Players may purchase Cargo Cubes from a plan-et’s Buy space. The cost is 1,000   for 2 Cargo Cubes.
•   Mine/Salvage/Harvest: Players may Mine, Salvage, or Harvest Cargo Cubes from the corresponding spaces on the board.
•  Sell Cargo Cubes: Cargo Cubes can be sold at a planet’s Sell spac-es. The player receives 1,000   per Cargo Cube sold.
•  Collect Cubes (Minor): Cargo Cubes on a board space can be col-lected by a ship located in the same space as the Cargo Cube.

Explore (see Exploration, pg. 10)
•  Scan Sector: A player adjacent to an unexplored edge (and not in-side a Planetary shield) may draw a new Sector tile from the stack at a cost of 1 Energy.
•  Blind Jump (Minor): A player adjacent to an unexplored edge may draw a new Sector tile from the stack, place it, and move into it.
•  Collect Exploration Token (Minor): Players can collect Exploration tokens from Exploration spaces. Exploration might provide bene-fits like Cargo Cubes, Energy, additional Movement, a special Mis-sions… or instead, you might take Ice Damage!
Other
•  Ability Cards: Some Abilities are designated as Actions.
•  Rescue a Stranded Player: A player may rescue an adjacent player who has no Energy/Armed markers by giving her 2 Energy.
•  Jettison Cargo (Minor): A player may discard her current Mission card or jettison any Cargo Cubes in her Hold. To do the latter, simply move those cubes onto the space on the sector tile occu-pied by the Miniature. A player may not pick up any Cargo Cubes that she jettisoned on that turn.
(Minor) Actions: Several of these actions, marked as (Minor), may be taken during a Move action without ending the movement.
Example: You use an Engine to take a Move action. On the roll, you receive a 5, allowing you to move a total of 5 spaces. You may move 3 spaces, take a Blind Jump (Minor) action, move 1 space, Collect an Exploration token (Minor) Action, and move one final space. However, if you took a Scan Sec-tor action instead of the Blind Jump (Minor) action, your Move action would end and you couldn’t move the final two spaces.)
After completing the Action Phase (either by being unable to take another action or by deciding to end the phase), a player must either move on to the Business Phase or the Status Phase.


2. Business Phase
To conduct Business, a player must end his Action Phase on a Planet (any space inside a Planetary Shield). If a player doesn’t end his turn on a Planet, his Business Phase is skipped. Once a player starts the Busi-ness Phase, he may not take any more actions (he has landed on the planet). Players may conduct as much business as they would like, provided they have the necessary number of Credits.
Players may do the following, in any order, during the Business Phase:
•  Recharge Energy: A player may recharge his Energy Meter up to its maximum for free.
•  Repair Damage: A player with a Tier	or Tier	ship may spend 1,000   to remove all Damage markers from his ship. Tier	ships cost 2,000   to repair.
•  Buy Outfits: A player may purchase new Outfits, provided they fit in the Hold.
•  Sell Outfits: A player may sell any undamaged Outfit for half of its original cost, rounded up. Tier	Outfits sell for 1,000  , Tier	for 1,000  , and Tier	for 2,000  .
•  Rearrange Hold: A player may rearrange any item in their ship’s Hold. Damage markers and Outfits with Damage markers cannot be rearranged in this manner.
•  Buy New Ship: A player may purchase a ship that is one tier higher than his current ship. The cost to do so is displayed on the higher-tiered ship’s Ship Mat.
•  Buy Fame: A player may purchase* 1   for 5,000  .
* Players cannot purchase the final Fame Point required for victory.
When the player completes his Business Phase, he moves on to his Status Phase.

Consolidated Rulebook



3. Status Phase
The Status Phase is a brief phase in which elements of the game are updated. During the Status Phase, the active player completes the following steps in order:
1.  Claim Fame: The player claims any unclaimed Titles and Fame Points acquired during their turn. If the player reaches the Victory Marker, the game ends and the player claims victory!
2.  Draw Titles: Title cards are drawn the first time any player’s Mark-er reaches a yellow Title space on the Fame Point Track. (Ex. The first player to reach 3 Fame Points will draw a Title card, but the next player to reach 3 Fame Points will not.)
3.  Refresh: The player’s exhausted Ability cards and Impulse token are now refreshed by flipping them face up.

SOLO:6. End of Round
Immediately after all of the NPC turns, but before resolving events, you must do the following:
1.  Remove any cubes on the map (either from the Jettison Cargo ac-tion, or from the player’s ship being destroyed/damaged).
2.  Roll a   [d20].
•  Add +2 for each cube removed in step 1, above.
Add +2 for each 1,000   NPCs collected this turn (either from bounty due to destroying ships, or events.)
•  Add +2 for each    the NPCs are behind.
•  Add +X for certain Merchant NPC behaviors.
Then, advance the NPC Fame Point track marker as follows:



4.  Arm Markers: The active player may arm any spent or Disarmed markers by moving them onto the Armed spaces of his Ship Mat.
•  It costs one Energy to move each Marker to an Armed space.
•  If a Marker is not armed, it is placed on a Disarmed space (no markers should be left on any Outfits).
•  When arming markers while on a planet, players do not have to spend Energy.


Result	Earned
1–3                  0 4–14                 1 15–20                 2 21–25                 3
26–30	4
31+	5



SOLO:3.1. Winning the Game
Check to see if you’ve won the game (met or exceeded the	needed for victory) on each of your Status Phases.


Note: There is only one Fame Point track marker for the NPCs collec-tively. They get only a single roll at the end of each round.
The NPCs can cause new Titles and Events to be revealed if they’re in the lead. Reveal the appropriate cards immediately. If the NPCs reach the selected number of Fame Points for victory, you lose.



SOLO:4. System Expanse
Immediately after the end of each of your turns, before any NPC turns, reveal a new sector:
1.  Identify empty spaces where sectors could be placed. Choose an empty space that is adjacent to the most sectors (or tied for most).
2.  Pick an edge symbol.
3.  Reveal a new sector and match it with the chosen edge symbol.
4.  Spawn NPCs if needed. A newly-spawned NPC will take its turn normally.


SOLO:5. NPC Phase When an NPC first enters play:
1.  Place the NPC cards on the table in whatever order you choose.
2.  Randomly draw a Behavior card for the NPC, which will have the following properties:
•  A Target for the NPC to focus its efforts.
•  A list of Behaviors for the NPC to follow, in order if possible. These include actions such as “Move to Target,” “Buy Cargo,” “Attack,” etc.
3.  If the Enforcer of Scoundrel destroys the player’s ship, immediate-ly award the NPCs 1  , 2  , or 3  , depending on the tier of your de-stroyed ship.
4.  If the NPC is destroyed by the player, optionally draw a new Behav-ior card for that NPC.
(For more rules about NPCs in Solo Mode, see NPC Behaviors, pg. 17.)

Example: It’s the end of the round (you and each of the NPCs have taken a turn), so now you must roll for the NPC’s Fame Points. You didn’t jettison any cubes and the NPCs didn’t earn any credits from bounty this round, so they don’t get any bonuses from that. You are winning 6   to 5   , so they will get +2 to their roll (+2 for each	you’re ahead). Also, the Merchant happens to have the Usual Suspect Behavior, and it reached 2 different Sell spaces on its turn, giving the NPCs another +4. You roll the d20 and get a 12, +2 from being ahead, +4 from the Merchant, which equals a result of 18. The NPCs score 2   and the score is now 7–6 in their favor. They were the first to reach 7   , so you draw a new Event card now, and then resolve any events that trigger at end of round (including the one you just drew, if appropriate). Then, you start your next turn.


Ties/Disputes
Ties or rule disputes should be resolved with the   [d20] as follows:
Divide 20 by the number of ties/disputes, giving each ship/playeran equalportionofthedie(e.g. for a tie between two ships/players, use 1– 10 and 11–20; between three ships/players, use 1–6, 7–12, and 13–18 (19–20 is a re-roll); etc.)
The number rolled determines the winner. In the case of a rule dis-pute, this result lasts for the rest of the game.


2-Player Variant
The 2-Player Rules are the same as a normal game except:
•  Targets: NPCs count as players for Mission target purposes (just like solo play) with the exception of The Kiln. If playing without NPCs, the opposing player is always your Mission target.
•  ‘Lone Drifter’ Auto-Pilot: Add +2 movement to successful rolls.

XIA: LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM


GAME BOARD: Sectors/Borders

Sectors
The game board is made up of Sector tiles with some or all of the fol-lowing elements:
1.  Name/Type: Each Sector tile has a unique name. An icon (   ,   ,   , ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,	, or	) and sub-text denote the Sector’s type.
2.  Mission Point: This space (  ) is used to Draw and Complete Mis-sions (see Missions Overview, pg. 13).
3.  Spawn Point: This space (  ) is used to Spawn and Respawn ships. 4.  Exploration Space: Place Exploration tokens (  ) on this space.
5.  Symbols: Each side of the Sector tile has a Symbol. When a player draws a new Sector tile, the Symbols are used to align the new tile with the tile on which the player’s ship is currently located. After the Sector tile is placed, the Symbols may be ignored. It’s fine if this results in Symbols not lining up with all surrounding tiles.
Borders: Each Sector tile is made up of 19 hexagonal spaces. These hex spaces are divided by different kinds of Borders, each with their own set of rules (see Borders).
Special Spaces: Some Sectors have special spaces for Cargo Cubes: Buy, Sell, Mine, Salvage, and Harvest spaces (see Cargo Cubes, pg. 15). In addition, some Sectors have spaces that detail special rules for that Sector or space. These special spaces are treated as Normal Space for Movement and Line of Sight.
Calculating Distance: Certain rules, or cards require players to calcu-late distance in Sectors rather than spaces. These are not interchange-able units of distance. (Ex. A ship could be one space away, but in a differ-ent Sector.)


Exploration
To explore new Sectors of the system, a ship needs to first be on a space with an unexplored edge, and there has to be at least one Sec-tor tile left in the deck.
Unexplored Edge: An unexplored edge is any edge space that does not touch another Sector tile. Once positioned on an unexplored edge, there are two options:
1.  Scan: A player may take a Scan action to draw a Sector tile from the Sector Deck; this costs 1 Energy. The Sector tile is flipped face up, and a Symbol from the drawn tile is matched with the Symbol on the same Sector tile edge as the player’s ship. Again, this might result in other Symbols not matching; this is fine.
2.  Blind Jump: A player may take a (Minor) Action to Blind Jump onto a new Sector tile. The player declares an adjacent, unexplored space into which he wants to move, and spends 1 movement. He then draws a Sector tile, matches the Symbol, and places the tile. The player must move into the space he declared at the beginning of the Blind Jump (Minor) Action. (Ex. A player that Blind Jumps into a Star is immediately destroyed – he can’t choose to abort the jump). Remember, Blind Jump is a (Minor) Action, so it can be done during a Move action. This allows the player to continue the Move action after the Jump. A Scan action would require ending the Move.
3.  Nuances: If a player’s ship is on a space that has more than one un-explored edge, he must declare which edge he is exploring before drawing the new tile. Edge symbols are only used when drawing a new tile and are only important to match with the exploring play-er’s tile of origin. Edge symbols are not intended to match up with all surrounding tiles. (If this annoys you, sorry!)


Exploration Tokens
Exploration spaces represent areas of interest in a Sector. A captain might make a discovery of cargo, or a much-needed boost of energy!
Placing: When a newly drawn Sector tile has an Exploration space, an Exploration token* is taken face down from the pile and placed on the Exploration space face down. Do not reveal the Exploration token.


Exploring: The first player to move their ship onto the Exploration space claims the Exploration token. Place it face up on your ship mat and immediately resolve the token.
•  Cargo Cube: Take a matching Cargo Cube from the supply and place it in your Hold – if you do not have space in your Hold, the cube is placed in your space on the board (as if jettisoned).
•  Energy: Immediately refill your Energy meter to maximum (player may not re-arm until Status Phase).
•  Ice Damage: Immediately take 1 Ice Damage (block with a Shield).
•  Movement: Immediately gain up to +5 Movement, even when Stranded.
•  Captain In Need: Draw the top Mission card (  ) and read the De-liver To Mission Point; ignore everything else on the card. To com-plete Captain in Need, transport the captain to the Deliver To Mis-sion Point. On completion, you earn 1   and 1,000  . Captain in Need takes up an Active Mission slot; you may discard an existing Mission to make a slot available. If you do not wish to accept the Captain in Need, you may discard the Mission card (keep the token on your ship mat either way).
After resolving an Exploration token, keep it face up on your ship mat.
Whenever you have 2 Exploration tokens face-up on your ship mat, after resolving the one you just collected, discard both tokens (re-move from the game) and gain either 1   OR 2,000  .
* Exploration spaces do not “respawn” tokens, so an Exploration space will only receive one token per game. Sectors without Exploration spaces do not receive Exploration tokens.


Relic Tokens
Relic tokens take up 2 Cargo spaces in your Hold. While in your Hold, they act similar to Cargo Cubes (can be stored inside of Cargo Pods) and can be removed by the Jettison Cargo (Minor) Action. If a space holding a Relic token is damaged, that token is automatically jetti-soned. If a Relic token is jettisoned (either by taking the action, or by damage), that token is destroyed (removed from the game).
Sift: While docked with The Kiln, as an action, you may Sift any Relic tokens in your Hold. When you Sift a token, it is removed from your Hold, flipped face up, and you must choose to receive 1   OR the re-wards shown. Any rewards that will not fit in your Hold (cubes or mods) are ignored.
Sifted Relic tokens are worth: •  1   OR 3,000
•  1   OR 2,000   + 2 Specified Cubes •  1   OR 2,000   + Specified Mod

Borders
There are fourteen types of Borders which affect the board (though some share rules). The rules associated with Borders affect Movement and Line of Sight determinations.
Some Borders have different rules when entering than when exiting (Ex. Nebulas take Energy from a ship when entering, but not when exiting). If the rule doesn’t specify between entering and exiting, the rule ap-plies to both.
When a ship passes a Border that requires a   [d20] roll, that roll is applied and resolved immediately. The Move action then continues directly after the   [d20] roll is resolved, similar to a (Minor) Action.
Normal: Normal Space is represented by dashed white lines. Normal Space is simply empty areas of the star system, and has no special rules for Movement or Line of Sight.
Star: Star Borders are denoted with solid, red lines. Star Borders rep-resent the edges of Stars. Stars block Line of Sight, and any ship that moves through a Star Border is immediately destroyed. (The ship melts in the intense heat.)
Asteroid: Asteroid Fields are represented by jagged-yet-solid orange lines. Asteroid Fields block Line of Sight. Ships may move through them, but the odds of safely navigating through one are slim.



10
Consolidated Rulebook



•  Entering: Roll a   [d20]:
▫  1–10: The ship takes Damage equal to the roll (an asteroid has collided with the ship). Shield Outfits and Abilities may be used immediately after the roll to mitigate this Damage.
▫  11–20: No Damage is taken. (Skillful flying has saved the ship!)
•  Exiting: A player may exit an Asteroid space without consequence. However, if the player moves into a new Asteroid space, he must roll for Damage, as above.
Planetary Shields: Planetary Shields are represented by solid, glowing lines in red, green, or blue (the rules are the same for every color). Planetary Shields block Line of Sight. Players may attempt to move through Planetary Shields, but it is a dangerous and illegal act with the following consequences:
•  Crossing: If a player crosses a Planetary Shield, whether to enter the planet’s area or to leave it, he must roll a   [d20]:
▫  1–10: The Planetary Shield prevents crossing. The ship cannot move into the desired space, and loses that 1 Movement point (though it may still continue its Move action, if it has more movement). Additionally, the ship takes (unblockable) Damage (  ) equal to the roll (the ship crashed into the pulsing Shield).
▫  11–17: The ship successfully crosses the Planetary Shield, but it is detected! 1,000   is added to its Bounty (  ) .
▫  18–20: The ship successfully crosses the Planetary Shield unde-tected, with no consequences.
Planet Entrances: Planetary Entrances are represented by dashed, glowing lines in red, green, or blue (but much lighter than the Plane-tary Shield lines). Planetary Entrances block Line of Sight. Moving through a Planetary Entrance has rules associated with it depending on the legal status of the planet and ship.
Nebulae: Nebulae are represented by solid, pink lines. Nebulae do not affect Line of Sight. Ships may fly through Nebulae, but there are cer-tain risks involved.
•  Entering: Roll a   [d20]:
▫  1–10: Subtract an amount of Energy from the ship’s Energy Meter equal to the roll (the ship hit a volatile electrostatic gas cloud). Shield Outfits and Abilities may be used after the roll to mitigate this Energy loss.
If the player does not have enough Energy to satisfy the roll, then he must disarm Armed markers, moving them to the Dis-armed section of the Ship Mat (one per Energy lost). If his total Energy and Armed markers are less than the roll, the player is immediately Stranded and may only use Impulse.
▫  11–20: The ship enters the Nebula with no consequences.
•  Exiting: Once inside a Nebula, players may stay in, move around, or exit the Nebula without consequences.
Inner Borders: Planets and Nebulae have Inner Borders (dashed lines in the color of the Outer Border). These spaces are considered Normal Space and are simply meant to denote the region of space these fea-tures occupy.
Debris: Debris Fields are represented by solid, yellow lines. Debris Fields block Line of Sight. Ships may move through Debris Fields, but it’s a risky move:
•  Entering: Roll a   [d20]:
▫  1–3: The ship is immediately destroyed (an old space mine or unstable nuclear reactor detonates, taking you with it!).
▫  4–20: The ship passes through the Debris Field without any consequences.
•  Exiting: A player may exit a Debris Field without any conse-quences. However, if he moves into a new Debris Field, he must roll for Damage, as above.
Gates: Gates are represented by solid, green lines. Gates do not affect Line of Sight. Ships may move through Gate spaces as if they were Normal Space. They may also use Gates:
•  Use Gate: A ship on a Gate may spend 1 Movement point to travel to any space on any other Gate. (The gates allow ships to travel through their sub-space Tether.)
•  Gate special movement is not considered when determining Adja-cency, Range, or Line of Sight. Other than the special movement, treat Gate spaces as Normal Space.

•  Tigris: The Tigris Gate is malfunctioning and it is not connected to other Gates (in either direction). Instead, players will roll a   [d20] and be placed on the numbered Spawn Point closest to the roll (on a tie, choose the higher-numbered Spawn Point). On a roll of 20, the player may choose any Spawn Point (in addition to receiving 1 Fame Point for “Luck.”)
Applying Border Effects: As soon as a ship moves through (or at-tempts to move through) a border that requires a roll, that roll must be made and applied. (Ex. A player uses an Engine, rolls a 5, and moves one space into a Nebula. The d20 roll is an 8 – this drains the ship of all Energy and Armed markers. The ship is immediately Stranded and may only use Impulse. The ship does not get to use the remaining 4 movement from the Engine.)
Double Traversal: When a ship crosses two borders with a single Movement point, the player applies the appropriate effects for both borders in the order that they are crossed. (Ex. A player moves one space, exiting through a Planetary Shield and entering a Nebula. The player first rolls for the Planetary Shield and applies the outcome; then he rolls for the Nebula and applies the outcome.) If both borders are not successfully passed, the ship remains in its origin space.


Planets
There are seven planets in the base game: Lunari, Kemplar II, Azure, Doravin V, Loath, Neo Damascus, and Smugglers’ Den (an asteroid that has the same rules as a planet). Planets are the only places on the board where players may initiate their Business Phase. Planets have Buy and Sell spaces for buying and selling Cargo Cubes (see Cargo Cubes, pg. 15). Planets have powerful shields surrounding them that make crossing them dangerous, but Planetary Entrances allow safer movement for certain ships (see details later in this section). Players don’t have to use the Entrance; they may try to illegally sneak through the Planetary Shield.
If a player is on a space inside a Planetary Shield, she is considered on that planet.
There are three types of planets:
Lawful (blue): Any Outlaw ship (a ship with a Bounty) cannot enter (but may exit) through the Planetary Entrance. Outlaw ships may still try to enter illegally through the Planetary Shield.
Outlaw (red): Any Innocent ship (a ship without a Bounty) that passes through the Planetary Entrance receives +1,000   Bounty (for being seen associating with Outlaws).
Neutral (green): These planets have no special rules.
These special rules for planets apply in addition to the rules for Plane-tary Shields and Entrances.


Adjacency
Ships are considered adjacent when they occupy spaces that are di-rectly next to each other. The only Borders that affect adjacency are Planetary Shields and Planetary Entrances.
Determining Adjacency: Unlike other Borders, if a Planetary Shield or Planetary Entrance is separating two ships or spaces, they are not considered to be adjacent to each other for the purpose of Attacks, Missions, and Special Abilities. As a rule of thumb, to interact with a ship on a Planet, players must also be on that Planet.
Line of Sight vs. Adjacent: Line of Sight is different from adjacency. Two ships can be adjacent without having Line of Sight. Some actions or Abilities require Line of Sight, while others simply require being adjacent. (Ex. For a Thief Mission’s “Steal” Objective action, only being adjacent is required. This means that if the target ship is inside an Asteroid space, the action can still take place; however, an action that requires Line of Sight, such as using a Blaster against the target, could not be taken.)

XIA: LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM



Nyr/The Kiln
The Kiln: The Kiln is a space station NPC that orbits the star Nyr. Ships can dock with The Kiln (similar to landing on a planet).
Setup: During setup, The Kiln is placed on the special rules space of the Nyr sector tile.
Docking: You may dock with The Kiln from any space adjacent to The Kiln miniature, at the cost of 1 movement. Place your ship on any space on the NPC card.
Orbit: When a player’s ship docks with The Kiln, it will orbit the star Nyr. Immediately roll the   [d6] and move the station along its path a number of spaces equal to the roll. The Kiln cannot end movement in an occupied space; it will instead reduce its move by 1 until it ends in an unoccupied space.
Sift Action: While docked with the station with a Relic token in your Hold, you may take the “Sift” action. When you Sift a token, it is re-moved from your Hold and revealed, at which point you pick which reward to receive, either 1   or some financial gain.
Embers: The white Cargo Cube, Ember, can be sold on the Sell space here at a rate of 2,000   per cube. Selling all your cargo of Ember (min-imum 2 cubes) will award 1  .
Inside: Similar to being “on” a planet, players outside of The Kiln can-not interact with players inside of The Kiln. When two or three ships are inside The Kiln, they are considered adjacent. NPCs can enter The Kiln, just as they can with a Neutral planet. When inside The Kiln you can move by spending movement, same as if you were on a planet. You may exit The Kiln from any space inside the station, this costs 1 movement, and you’ll place your ship on the game board in any space adjacent to The Kiln.
Business Phase: Ships that end their Action Phase docked with the station may take their normal Business Phase actions as if on a planet.
Station’s Turn: The Kiln does not take turns like normal NPCs (it moves when activated by a ship Docking with it). The Kiln cannot be affected, attacked, or damaged by other ships. In the unlikely event that The Kiln is destroyed (e.g. if struck by Rikishi), all ships currently docked are destroyed as well. The Kiln respawns on the special rules space of Nyr at the start of the next player’s turn.


Dead Worlds Excavate/Relic Tokens
Players can take an Excavate action on Excavate spaces of Dead Worlds. You must have 2 orthogonally adjacent empty spaces in your Cargo Hold to take an Excavate action.
When excavating roll the   [d20]:
•  On 1–10, take the number rolled as Ice Damage.
•  On 11–20 you gain 1 Relic token placed in your Hold, face down, without looking at the contents.
Relic Token Space: When a Dead World is discovered, place the num-ber of Relic tokens specified on this space (3 or 4). Each time a player succeeds at an Excavate action on this sector, they take the top Relic token from the stack.
When there are no more tokens in the stack, that site has collapsed and cannot be Excavated any more this game. These spaces otherwise act as normal space that is occupied while tokens are present (you can fly through it, but cannot end movement there.) The tokens here can-not be interacted with and merely act as a timer for the Relic site.
No Business Phase: You cannot take a Business Phase on a Dead World like you can on normal planets.


Anomalies
Gravity Paths (Purple/orange dashed glowing paths)
Anomaly sectors have very concentrated gravity, represented by dashed/glowing paths. Some Anomaly sectors have multiple paths (either orange, or purple).

Entering: Whenever a player (not NPC) enters a gravity path (on any space of that path) they must roll the die specified on the rules space-for that path. Their ship then moves along that path the number of spaces rolled. You must roll for entering any space of the gravity path, including the special rules space.
Moving: After making the roll for entering the path, if your ship is still on that gravity path, you may move along the path (with the arrows or against the arrows) or exit the path without rolling again for that path. You retain any surplus movement you had before you entered the path, and can use it after you finish your forced path movement. Once you move off the path, if you reenter it later, you’ll need to roll again.
Pushed off: Most paths will push you through a negative border if you are pushed all the way to the end of that path. If you roll any number that would push you off of the end of the path, your ship is pushed all the way off the path, and any excess “path movement” is discarded. You must apply the effects of the space that you move into, as if you had moved there normally.
Actions: Players may not take any actions (minor or otherwise) while the gravity forced movement is being resolved. After the forced movement is resolved, the players can take actions normally (and per-haps backtrack along the path to take desired actions).
Example: A ship moves onto the outer path (purple) of Ferren’s Call with 4 movement left over. The ship immediately rolls for the purple gravity path, rolling the d12 (specified on the rule space for that path). The roll is a 8, moving the ship 5 spaces along the path, the 6th movement causes the ship to move off of the end of the path, the extra 2 movement from the gravity path is discarded.
The ship has now entered the inner (orange) ring and must immediately roll the d6 and move along that path. After the d6 forced movement is re-solved, the player can still use the 4 movement they had left over when entering the path in the first place (that is, assuming they weren’t just destroyed by the black hole at the center!).


Comets/Ice Asteroids
Comets and Comet Paths (Light blue dashed glowing paths).
Comets move along a specific path. Each Ice Asteroid sector contains 1 Comet. When the sector is first revealed, place a comet on the special rules space.
Whenever any player (not NPC) moves onto any space on the path of a Comet, immediately roll the   [d6] and move that Comet the number of spaces rolled along the path. If a ship enters a space containing a Comet, or if a Comet ends movement on a space with a ship/Cargo Cube, that ship/cube is instantly destroyed (same rules as a Star bor-der). Assuming the ship wasn’t destroyed by the comet’s movement, the ship may continue moving normally.
After the comet’s initial movement, it won’t move again until the ship moves off the path and back onto it, or a 2nd ship enters the path.
Actions: Players may not take any actions (including minor) after trig-gering the comet movement, until the comet movement is resolved.
Example 1: A ship moves onto the comet path with 5 movement remaining. The player immediately rolls for the comet, rolling a 5, so the comet moves 5 along the path. The player continues movement, and can continue safely along the path without triggering the comet again. If the ship moves off the path and back on it, the comet will move again.
Example 2: A ship moves onto a comet path, directly in front of the comet and rolls a 2. The comet moves two spaces, passing through the ship’s space and ending on the space just past the ship. The ship is not harmed by the comet.
In the unlikely event that a comet is destroyed, the comet respawns on the special rules space at the start of the next player’s turn.
Ice Asteroids
Ice Asteroid spaces have solid white borders and blue ice asteroid artwork inside. Ice Asteroids block line of sight. Players must roll
[d20] when entering an Ice border:
•  On 1–10, take the number rolled as Ice Damage (blockable with shields) (see Ice Damage, pg. 7).
•  On 11–20, nothing happens.

Consolidated Rulebook


CARDS: Titles/Missions/Events

Titles
Titles are a mark of Fame for pilots who complete certain exploits. Once a Title is drawn, all players compete to complete its objective and claim the Title for their own. Titles are unique and range in diffi-culty and reward. Titles are worth 1   to 3   and grant small abilities called Skills. Once the Title has been claimed, it is no longer available for other players to claim. The following rules discuss drawing and claiming Titles.
Drawing: The yellow spaces on the Fame Point Track are Title spaces. The first player to move his Marker onto or past a Title space draws a Title card, reads it aloud, and places it face up in the play area within view of all players. It is now available for any player to claim.
Example: The first player to reach 3 on the Fame Point Track draws a Title card, reads it aloud, and places it on the table. The next player to reach 3 on the Fame Point Track does not draw a new Title card.
Claiming: The first player to complete the Title’s objective (as listed on the Title card) may claim it during their Status Phase. The player takes the Title card, places it face up in his play area, and receives the Fame Point(s) and Skill listed on the card. Players may claim multiple Titles on their turn as long as they meet all necessary objectives.
Skills: In addition to granting a player Fame Points, each Title gives a player a Skill. Skills are immediately available to the Title holder. These Skills help to enhance a player’s actions or provide new powers. Read each Title card for more details.


Missions Overview
Each Mission card has the following features: 1.  Mission Type
2.  Story Text
3.  Objectives – different for each Mission Type 4.  Payment – determined by different factors
5.  Delivery – the Sector tile containing the Mission Point on which the player must be located to complete the Mission.
Completing Missions is one way for players to earn Credits and Fame Points. Missions come in a variety of Types, pay different amounts, and can be either Outlaw or Lawful.
Draw: While on a Mission Point (   ), a player without an Active Mission can choose to draw Mission cards as a (Minor) Action. The player draws the top 3 Mission cards from the Mission Deck and places them face down in his player area without looking at them. After his turn ends (during other players’ turns), he may look at the Mission cards drawn and decide which to keep before the start of his next turn. A player may select a single Mission to accept as an Active Mission, or none. Missions that are not accepted are discarded.
The Draw (Minor) Action may be taken once per	per turn. As normal, players may only take the draw action if they have capacity for at least one Active Mission, and they can only keep as many Missions as they have capacity for (default: 1). A player may have at most one Active Mission at a time, and Active Missions can be discarded at any time.
Example: You don’t have any Missions. You fly over 2 Mission points, draw-ing 3 twice, for a total of 6 cards (looking at none of them). After your turn ends, you look at all 6 cards and keep 1. If you had a M-Comp mod, you could keep up to 3 instead.

SOLO: Each time you take the Draw Missions action in solo play, you may look at the Missions immediately and keep the appropriate num-ber based on your available Mission slots (instead of waiting until your turn is over in multiplayer). You may also choose to wait until the end of your turn, if you prefer.

Objectives: Each Mission Type has different Objectives, listed on the Mission cards. Most Objectives require taking an action to complete. These Objectives must be fulfilled before a player can Deliver the Mission and receive the Payment. Specific Objectives for Mission Types are explained in the Lawful and Outlaw Mission sections.


Reveal: Immediately after completing the Objective(s), the player must flip the Mission card face up and reveal the Mission. At this time, place the Payment on the Mission card. The Mission must still be De-livered before this Payment can be claimed.
Deliver: Once the Mission’s Objective(s) is complete and the Mission card Revealed, a player can go to the specified Delivery Mission Point (  ) to complete the Mission. The player declares a “Complete a Mis-sion” action. Note that this is not a (Minor) Action, so a player must end any Move actions in order to take this action.
Payment: Once the player has taken the Complete a Mission action, he receives the payment on the Mission card, earns one Fame Point, and, if applicable as stated on the Mission card, his Bounty (  ) increases. Flip the completed Mission face down; it is no longer considered Ac-tive. The completed Mission is kept in the player’s play area.


Missions Details
Experience: A previously completed Mission may be used to increase the odds of success when attempting a Mission of the same type. Directly after taking a Mission action that requires a   [d20] roll: The player may discard one of their previously completed Missions of the same type and roll the   [d20] again, keeping only this new result.
Example: You’ve already completed 2 Research Missions, and their cards are face down in your play area. You attempt a third Research Mission. When taking the Research action, you roll the d20 and receive a 2. You discard one of your previously completed Research cards to re-roll the d20 and receive a 3. You then spend your final remaining Research card and re-roll the d20 one more time, receiving a result of 16.
Missions without   [d20] rolls are not affected by Experience.
Death: When a player’s ship is destroyed, any Active Mission he has is immediately discarded. If his ship is destroyed with drawn Missions, he must discard them without looking at them.
Abort Mission: A player may discard his current Active Mission by tak-ing a Jettison Cargo (Minor) Action. Place the Mission card in the Mis-sion card Discard Pile. There are no negative repercussions for discard-ing a Mission.
Discard Pile: If the Mission card deck runs out, shuffle the Mission card discard pile and create a new Mission card deck.
Shortest Flyable Distance: Some Missions require players to calculate the shortest flyable distance, measured in Sectors. To calculate this distance, start from the Sector tile containing the “Pick up” Mission Point and count the fewest number of flyable tiles you need to move into to reach the tile containing the “Deliver” Mission Point. You must count the most direct route that it is possible to fly. Do not count un-explored space or Star Sectors as flyable tiles. Gate “special move-ment” is never used when calculating shortest flyable distance.
Example: If the “Pick up” Sector is adjacent to the “Deliver” Sector, the shortest flyable distance is 1 Sector.)
Note: Mission cargo/passengers are symbolic and do not have a physi-cal representation or take up Hold spaces: Goods, Contraband, Pas-sengers, etc. For example, nothing is actually stolen on a Thief Mission.


Lawful Missions
Lawful Missions are a great source of income and Fame for upstanding citizens (Outlaw players may still take Lawful Missions). There are five kinds of Lawful Missions:
Shuttle
1.  Fly to Mission Point (   ).
2.  As an Action: Pick up passengers at the   .
3.  Reveal Mission card. Place Credits equal to the specified Payment on the Mission card. Payment is determined by the shortest flyable distance between the pick-up and dropoff locations, measured in Sector tiles. If the Delivery	has not yet been revealed, wait until it is and then immediately calculate Payment, placing it on the Mis-sion card.
4.  As an Action: Deliver passengers to Delivery   . 5.  Receive Payment on Mission card.

2.  As an Action: When adjacent to specified target, reveal Mission card and declare how you will split 4,000   reward. After target chooses to Launder or Snitch, roll a   [d20].
3. Reward is determined by target’s choice and   [d20] result.


SOLO:Mission Targets
In solo play, Missions that target players (e.g. Thief, Assassin, etc.) target the Scoundrel/Enforcer/Merchant NPCs instead. When those NPCs enter play, the solo player chooses where the NPC “sits” in play-er order, which then allows the player to treat those NPCs as other players for purposes of Missions. Missions can never target the player themselves, the Sellsword, or the Space Station.
If only one of the Scoundrel/Enforcer/Merchant is in play, Missions that target the second player to the left or right cannot be completed; such Missions require at least two of the key NPCs to be in play.
When performing the Mission objective action (i.e. turning a Mission face up), check for the correct NPC target at that moment. If an NPC later enters the game, the new seating order only applies to Mission objectives not yet completed (i.e. only face-down Missions).
For the Missions & Powers expansion, target NPCs jettison all cargo (Transport), always heal (Assist), always use shields (BOOM!), and al-ways Snitch (Counterfeit).

Consolidated Rulebook



Event Cards
Event cards come out much like Titles, but change the game in dynam-ic and powerful ways. The first player to reach or pass an Event space on the Fame Point Track, will draw Event card. During the Status Phase of that player’s turn, they draw one Event card, read the card aloud to all players, and resolve any effects.
Rounds: Many Events last for a limited number of “rounds,” which must be tracked. In this case, the card is placed to the right of the First Player and any ‘round’ rules on the card activate before the First Play-er’s turn.
Event cards have two sections:
•  While this card is in play: This section shows the rules for when this card is in play – these rules often override normal rules.
•  This card leaves play when: This section shows the rules for when this card will leave play (often after a set number of rounds, or when a certain action is taken.)
Example: During Cody’s Status Phase, he draws an Event that will leave play after 3 Damage are placed on the card, and states that 1 Damage is placed on the card each round. The card is placed to the right of the First player, at the end of this round, we’ll place 1 Damage on the card. If Cody is the last player, we place a Damage on the Event now, since it’s the end of the round.
Event Tokens: There are 8 Event tokens with a pink “EV” on them that you can place on the game board as a reminder that an event is taking place (for example, on Tigris Gate during “Re-Tethered”).


CAPITALISM: Cargo Cubes and Credits

Cargo Cubes
Cargo Cubes represent goods that are traded throughout the system, and once obtained, can be sold for Credits and Fame. They are stored in empty spaces in the Hold of a ship, one Cargo Cube per space.
There are three ways to acquire Cargo Cubes:
•  Buy: Cargo Cubes can be bought from a Planet’s Buy space. Players can use a Buy Cargo Cubes action to buy two of the specified Car-go Cubes for 1,000  . Players may purchase as many Cargo Cubes as they want, as long as they have Credits and space in the Hold. The Smugglers Den sells Cargo Cubes of any color.
•  Mine/Salvage/Harvest: Cargo Cubes can be obtained by Mining Asteroid Fields, Salvaging technology from Debris Fields, and Har-vesting Nebula gasses (see Mine/Salvage/Harvest on the next page for more details).
•  Collect: Cargo Cubes that have been Jettisoned onto the game board can be collected by using a Collect Cargo Cubes (Minor) Ac-tion while on the same space as the Jettisoned Cargo Cubes. The player may collect any number of the Cubes in the space, as long as she has room in the Hold. A player may not collect any Cargo Cu-bes they have jettisoned in the same turn.
When a player acquires Cargo Cubes, the Cargo Cubes are placed into the player’s Hold. Once placed, Cargo Cubes may only be rearranged during that player’s Business Phase. Once acquired, Cargo Cubes can be sold or jettisoned:
•  Sell: Cargo Cubes that match the icon on a planet’s Sell space can be sold at that planet’s Sell space. Players can use a Sell Cargo Cu-bes action to sell as many of these Cargo Cubes as they want for 1,000   each. If a player Sells at least 2 Cargo Cubes and all the cu-bes in her Hold that location will buy, she also receives 1 Fame Point. A minimum of 2 Cargo Cubes is required to receive the Fame Point. Planet Loath buys Cargo Cubes of any color.
•  Jettison Cargo: Players can take a Jettison Cargo (Minor) Action to jettison any or all Cargo Cubes from their Hold. Remove the Jetti-soned Cargo Cubes from the Hold and place them on the game board on the same space as the jettisoning ship. A player that jet-tisons cargo can’t pick those cubes up in the same turn.
•  Damage: If a Damage Marker is placed in a Hold space currently holding a Cargo cube, the Cargo cube is immediately Jettisoned.

Cube Types
There are 6 types of Cargo Cubes:
Spice: These solid-orange cubes are represented on the board by an orange cube with an “S” on each face. They can be purchased at Kem-plar II, mined from Outpost 338, and sold at Neo Damascus.
Holo: These translucent, pink cubes are represented on the board by a pink cube with an “H” on each face. They can be purchased at Azure, Harvested from Burning Horse, and sold at Kemplar II.
Terra: These solid-green cubes are represented on the board by a green cube with a “T” on each face. They can be purchased at Doravin V, Mined from Red Gulch, and sold at Azure.
Plasma: These translucent, teal cubes are represented on the board by a teal cube with a “P” on each face. They can be purchased at Neo Damascus, Harvested from Lower Stratus, and sold at Lunari.
Cyber: These solid-purple cubes are represented on the board by a purple cube with a “C on each face. They can be purchased at Lunari, Salvaged from Pelmont and Kreller IV, and sold at Doravin V.
Ember: These pearlescent white cubes can be quarried from special Quarry spaces on select Ice Asteroid sectors.
To take the Quarry action, you must be on the Quarry space of the sector tile and have at least one free space in your Hold.
To take the Quarry action, roll the   [d20]:
•  1–10: Ice Damage equal to the result rolled (blockable by shields). •  11–20: Receive 1 Ember Cargo cube placed in your Hold.
Ember can be sold at The Kiln’s “Sell” space, when docked with the station, for 2,000   per cube. If you sell all of your Ember, and sell at least 2, you will gain 1   (same as other cubes).


Economy Board
Setup: Determine the starting number of each cube type by rolling the [d6] for each type and placing that number of cubes on that space.
Supply: Whenever a player wants to purchase cubes from a “Buy” space, the cubes must come from the Economy Board. Those cubes are removed and placed into your ship’s Hold.
Consume/Produce: When you sell cubes, each cube sold is consumed by the planet you are selling it to and placed back into supply; that planet (except for Loath) then produces a new cube of the type the planet generates, taking it from supply and placing it on the Economy Board. Each resource section on the Economy Board may only hold a maximum of 6 cubes of that type. When a resource section is full, any additional production of that resource type generated remains in sup-ply (though you can still keep selling).
Example: You take the Sell action on the Sell space on Neo Damascus, which currently has 4 Plasma cubes on the Economy Board. You sell 3 Spice, which are consumed (place the 3 Spice into supply). Neo Damascus then produces 3 cubes of its type (Plasma); the first 2 are placed onto the Economy Board, but since we’re at the maximum for that cube type (6) the last cube is left in supply.
Demand: If any resource section of the Economy Board is empty (con-tains no cubes) during the Status Phase of a player’s turn, place
1,000   in the empty resource section. That resource type is now “in demand.” The next player to generate that resource (as a result of selling the associated consumed resource) receives the 1,000   bonus. If a resource section on the Economy Board is already “in demand,” do not place another 1,000   in this space (max. 1,000  ).
Squander: When selling cubes to Loath the cubes are consumed (re-turned to supply), but no new cubes are produced.
Trade: The planet Kei has a special space that allows you to trade cu-bes. To trade, place any number of cubes in your hold onto the Econ-omy Board, then take an equal number of cubes of any other type from the Economy Board (e.g. if you placed Cyber onto the board, you can-not take Cyber during the same turn.) If you place cubes that are in Demand, you also gain the 1,000   reward.


15
XIA: LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM



Mine/Salvage/Harvest
There are 3 additional ways to obtain Cargo Cubes. Players can Mine Asteroid Fields, Salvage from Debris Fields, and Harvest from Nebulae.
In order to do so, the player must be on a space labeled “Mining”, “Sal-vage”, or “Harvest” and have at least one free space in his Hold. The player then declares he is taking a Mining, Salvaging, or Harvesting action. For each attempt, roll a   [d20] to determine the result:
Mine Action: This action represents the ship’s dangerous attempt to match velocity and trajectory with an asteroid in order to mine the valuable minerals and alloys:
•  1–10 (Failure): The ship receives the number rolled as Damage (  ). (The ship collided with an asteroid.) Shield Outfits and Special Abil-ities may be used after the roll to mitigate this Damage.
•  11–20 (Success): The ship receives one Cargo cube of the type dis-played on the Mining space. Players may attempt to Mine a single Mining space multiple times within their turn.
Salvage Action: This action represents the player’s attempt to pick through the hazardous remains of past battles and derelict ships to try to find something of value in the old wreckage:
•  1–3 (Failure): The ship is immediately destroyed. (A leftover space mine or unstable reactor has detonated!) This cannot be prevented with Shield Outfits or Special Abilities.
•  4–20 (Success): The ship receives one Cargo cube of the type dis-played on the Salvage space. Players may attempt to Salvage a single Salvage space multiple times within their turn.
Harvest Action: This action represents the ship’s attempt to harvest the elusive gasses that collect near the nebula’s more volatile regions:
•  1–10 (Failure): The ship loses Energy equal to the number rolled. (An electrostatic anomaly has absorbed the ship’s Energy.) Shield Outfits and Special Abilities may be used after the roll to mitigate this Energy loss.
If the player does not have enough Energy to satisfy the loss, then he must disarm Armed markers, moving them to the Disarmed sec-tion of the Ship Mat (one per Energy lost). If his total Energy and Armed markers are less than the roll, the player is immediately Stranded (see Stranded, pg. 8).
•  11–20 (Success): The ship receives one Cargo cube of the type dis-played on the Harvest space. Players may attempt to Harvest a single Harvest space multiple times within their turn.
These, like all actions except Impulse, cannot be taken while Stranded.


Credits
Credits (  ) are the currency of Xia. Credits are represented by metal Credit coins. Credits come in increments of 1,000   (silver) and 5,000 (blue). (2,000   (gold) coins are available as an expansion.)
Players can spend Credits to purchase repairs, new Outfits, new ships, and even Fame Points! Credits can be acquired in many different ways:
•  Spice: Players can seek out unclaimed Exploration tokens, some of which offer 1,000   as a reward.
•  Missions: Each Mission specifies how many    the player will earn by completing it.
•  Selling Cargo Cubes: Cargo Cubes sell for 1,000  .
•  Bounties: Ships that have a Bounty (  ) on them can be destroyed to earn that Bounty.
•  Free Trade: Players can give their Credits to other players freely. This allows players to bribe each other and forge alliances. (Bribes and alliances can be broken and are not considered binding.)
•  Ship Special Abilities: There are some ship Abilities that will help players get Credits.

INHABITANTS OF XIA: Non-Player Characters

Non-Player Ships
Non-Player ships (referred to as Non-Player Characters, or NPCs) are autonomous ships that are controlled by sets of rules.
There are three unique NPCs included in the base game: Enforcer, Scoundrel, and Merchant, and one NPC is available as an expansion: Sellsword. Each NPC has an NPC card that outlines its actions. NPC cards are dealt out at the beginning of the game (see Setup, pg. 1). The player dealt the NPC card for a particular NPC will be responsible for carrying out that NPC’s actions throughout the game. However, the player is not affiliated with the NPC in any way.
Spawning
NPCs are introduced (“spawned”) onto the board only when that NPC’s specific Sector tile has been placed on the board. Each NPC card states which tile that NPC will spawn on. When the NPC spawns, place it on the Spawn Point of the corresponding tile. If the Spawn Point is occupied, place the NPC on an adjacent unoccupied space. If the NPC is destroyed, it respawns at a random Spawn Point, like player ships.
NPC Turns
At the beginning of the game, the NPC cards are shuffled and dealt to the first three players. A player takes a turn for the NPC he controls directly after his turn. NPC turns do not have phases like player turns. To take an NPC turn, the player simply reads the NPC card from top to bottom, following the directions. A round of player and NPC turns in a 4-player game will look something like this:
1.  Player 1’s turn.
2.  Player 1 takes a turn for the Scoundrel. 3.  Player 2’s turn.
4.  Player 2 takes a turn for the Enforcer. 5.  Player 3’s turn.
6.  Player 3 would take a turn for the Merchant, but the turn is skipped because the Merchant hasn’t spawned yet.
7.  Player 4’s turn. (Player 4 did not receive an NPC card, as there are only 3 NPCs in the base game, so there is no NPC turn after Player 4’s turn, unless the Sellsword expansion is in play.)
8.  A new round starts with Player 1’s turn.


NPC Details
Defense: When attacked, an NPC will automatically defend. For each Attack action, use the defense specified in the blue “Defense” section of the NPC card.
Damage: When taking damage, the player controlling the NPC takes Damage markers and places them on the NPC card. When the number of markers on the card equals or exceeds the number specified in the yellow “To Kill” section of the NPC card, the NPC is destroyed.
Death and Respawn: When NPCs are destroyed, the NPC Miniature is immediately removed from the game board and placed on the NPC card. The player who destroyed the NPC takes any Credits and Fame Points specified in the green “On Kill” section of the NPC card. If one NPC destroys another NPC, the Credits on the destroyed NPC’s card are taken and placed on the attacking NPC’s card. (Ex. The Enforcer destroys the Scoundrel. Any Credits on the Scoundrel’s NPC card are taken and placed on the Enforcer’s NPC card.) NPCs also “forget” their most recent attacker when they are destroyed. Otherwise, the Death and Respawn of an NPC follow the same rules as those for players (see Death, pg. 7).
Movement: NPCs will avoid: Asteroid Fields, Debris Fields, Planetary Shields, and Stars. Nebulae do not affect NPCs. NPCs can use Gates. NPCs cannot take Scan or Blind Jump actions, and therefore cannot move into unexplored Sector tiles. NPCs always take the most direct route to their targets. If there is more than one most-direct route, the player controlling that NPC determines the path.





16
Consolidated Rulebook



•  Unreachable Sectors: Because of the random layout of the board, it is possible for there to be Sectors that are unreachable by NPCs without crossing through a regularly avoided border. In this case, the NPC will move through the safest/most direct path to reach that Sector. The safest path is determined in this order: Asteroids, Debris, then, as a last resort, Planetary Shields. NPCs must apply effects of these borders in the same way a player would.


NPC Types
Enforcer (  Lawful): The Enforcer is the law. The Enforcer targets nearby Outlaw ships, moves towards them, and, if possible, attacks. If there aren’t any nearby Outlaws, the Enforcer patrols between Lawful planets. If attacked, the Enforcer will attempt to retaliate. The Enforcer can never have a Bounty on it.
Scoundrel (  Outlaw): The Scoundrel is a dirty pirate. The Scoundrel will hunt down any nearby Innocent ships. After attacking, the Scoun-drel will run away towards its home planet of Loath. If attacked, the Scoundrel will attempt to retaliate. The Scoundrel cannot enter Lawful planets since it always has a Bounty on it. The Scoundrel will never target the Enforcer (he’s a coward!).
Merchant (   Neutral): The Merchant is a peaceful trader. During each of its turns, the Merchant will move along a trade route. Each time the merchant arrives at a planet’s Sell space, it will gain 1,000  . As the game progresses, the Merchant will become more and more wealthy, a tempting target for pirates! (Note: The Merchant does not actually buy and sell Cargo Cubes – the trading is merely symbolic.)
Optional NPC
Sellsword (  Outlaw): The Sellsword is a mercenary for hire and begins the game unclaimed. A player can hire the Sellsword and will then be able to take turns with the Sellsword until another player takes owner-ship, or the Sellsword is destroyed. The Sellsword is able to move and make an attack on its turn. The controlling player does not receive any Fame or Bounty for kills made by the Sellsword. If destroyed, the Sellsword card is taken from the controlling player and reverts to its original, unclaimed status.
•  Play: When the Smugglers’ Den Sector tile is first revealed, the Sellsword comes into the game. The miniature spawns inside of the Smugglers’ Den planet shields. Players are now able to take ad-vantage of hiring the Sellsword.

•  SOLO: Any NPC ships destroyed by the Sellsword will earn the player	and    (and campaign goal progress) as if the player de-stroyed the ship themselves, but any bounty goes on the Sellsword. If destroyed, the Sellsword respawns at a random spawn point as usual, but remains owned by the player. The Sellsword al-ways acts immediately after the player’s turn.

For more details read each NPC’s card.


SOLO:NPC Difficulty Level
To allow players to maximize their fun and balance the game to their desired level of difficulty, NPCs have 3 different difficulty levels on the double-sided NPC Stats card.
•  Easy mode: Use only Side A.
•  Normal mode: Use Side A until either you or the NPCs have sur-passed half the required Fame Points for this game, then flip to Side B (e.g. in a 15   game, flip once anyone has at least 8  ).
•  Hard mode: Use only Side B.
The NPC Stats replace the normal values listed on an NPC’s card. Note: The “On Kill” value remains unchanged.

SOLO:NPC Behaviors Behavior Cards
When an NPC first enters play (using normal spawn rules), randomly draw a behavior card for it. Then, randomly determine which behavior to use on that card. The NPC will follow those rules when taking a turn, instead of its normal rules. Note: The NPC still follows normal rules when spawning (i.e. the Scoundrel still starts with a 2,000 bounty on it).
Order of Resolution
Behaviors are resolved in the order listed on the card. If a step cannot be followed (e.g. “If in range, attack” but the NPC isn’t in range to attack), check to see if an alternate step applies (e.g. “If not, move to target again.”) The NPC’s turn ends if it cannot follow any more steps.
“Move to Target”
Behavior cards include the instruction “Move to target,” which means “move to the appropriate range based on the next action this NPC will take, then stop.” The Scoundrel moves adjacent, since it attacks with blasters; the Enforcer moves within missile range; the Merchant moves to the action space. If it’s not possible to reach the intended space, the NPC gets as close as possible. The Merchant will employ the Using Occupied spaces rule if needed (see Movement, pg. 7).
Doubled Actions
Some Behaviors instruct the NPC to make two attacks. Those are two separate attacks, so the player may re-arm shields between the at-tacks by spending Energy, per normal Combat rules.
Some NPC Behaviors instruct the NPC to move twice. If the NPC reaches the target in the first move, the 2nd movement is ignored
Changing Behaviors
Generally, each NPC’s behavior will remain the same throughout the game. But, if the player destroys an NPC, the player may optionally draw a new behavior card for that NPC, randomly picking which of the two Behaviors will now be in effect. The player may also opt to let the NPC keep their current behavior.


FLYING SOLO: Campaign Mode

SOLO:Campaign Details
For a truly epic solo experience, you may play Xia in Campaign Mode, which involves playing multiple solo games in a series and getting upgrades over time. Modify the solo rules as follows:
Setup
Hard mode is recommended for campaigns.
You can only pick a Tier	ship that you haven’t used this campaign, unless you’ve already used all the Tier	ships. In that case, you can only pick from ships you’ve used once, etc.
After setup and before starting your first turn, choose a goal card (see below) that you haven’t completed in this campaign. You may com-plete the goals in whatever order you choose.
Ship Upgrades
When upgrading your ship, you can only upgrade to a ship that you haven’t used in this campaign, unless you’ve already used every ship of that tier. In that case, you can only upgrade to a ship you’ve used once, etc.
Game End
After each game (win or lose), choose 1 campaign upgrade (see below). These apply for the rest of the campaign.
If you win the game AND meet the conditions of the goal, then you also earn the reward for that goal, which can be used for the rest of the campaign. You complete each goal exactly once per campaign. If you fail a goal (either by losing the game or reaching the	threshold without fulfilling the special rules of that goal), you must attempt that goal again later in the campaign, though not necessarily next game.





17
XIA: LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM



Campaign End
You successfully complete the campaign after you complete the last goal! There are 10 goals in the first solo campaign. Your final campaign score is the total of the point differential for each of your victories, minus 3 for each game that you didn’t complete a goal.
Example: A game that you win 12–7 contributes +5 to your campaign score. Total the point differential for each game you won, which should always be exactly 10 wins in the first campaign. A game that you lose (regardless of the final score) subtracts 3 from your campaign score. Track your scores in the Campaign Log in the official Solo rulebook.
Completing the campaign at all should be cause for celebration, but if you want to compare your results, visit: https://www.faroffgames.com/xia-solo-forum.


SOLO:Goal Cards Each campaign goal card includes:

Example: You have all 3 tiers of the upgrade above. You have a Tier
ship and 13,000   . During your Business Phase, you upgrade your ship 4 times (to Tier	, then    , then    , then    ). You spend 1,000   +
5,000   + 6,000   + 1,000   and earn 4   . You now have a Tier ship, three Tier	ship abilities, two Tier	ship abilities, two Tier ship abilities, and all the abilities cost 0 Energy to use. Each time you upgraded, you picked a ship you hadn’t used yet this campaign, and now those ships are considered used.
•  +1 Cargo cube from supply when taking the Buy action: Twice per turn, when you take a Buy action, gain an additional Cargo cube from the supply of a type bought. At Tier   , you also get +1,000 once per turn when you Sell. At Tier   , you start the game with +2,000  .


INDEX



Name and Fame Point limit: Depending on the goal you choose, the limit will vary.
Special Rules: These modify the normal rules of the game and general-ly restrict how you must complete the goal.
Reward: Once you complete a goal, you may use the reward in all fu-ture games of the campaign.
Note: You pick which goal card you want to attempt after setup is com-plete, before starting your first turn.


SOLO:Campaign Upgrades
After each game (win or loss) in campaign mode, you earn an upgrade, which applies for the rest of the campaign. You may take any of the Tier	upgrades at any time. To take a Tier	upgrade, you must have the appropriate Tier	upgrade from a previous game. To take a Tier
upgrade, you must have the appropriate Tier	upgrade.
•  +1 to each Engine use: Add +1 to each engine activation, possibly exceeding the maximum value for that engine. This upgrade im-proves to +3 or +5 in later tiers.
•  +1 to each Shield, Missile, and Blaster use: Add +1 to each activa-tion of a shield, missile, or blaster, possibly exceeding the maxi-mum for that Outfit. This upgrade improves to +3 or +5 in later ti-ers.
•  +3 Impulse: Your ship’s impulse is treated as 3 higher than usual. At Tier   , this upgrade also gives you a new action that you can take once per turn, to either heal 1 Damage or gain 1 Energy. At Tier   , the action improves to a (Minor) Action that you can use twice per turn. Note: You can use minor actions even when stranded.
•  +3 to all Mission rolls: Any time you roll for a Mission result, you may add 3 (max 20). At Tier   , this upgrade also changes Mission Objective and Mission Complete actions into (Minor) Actions. At Tier   , this upgrade also allows you to take the Scan actions from anywhere on the sector; choose the edge symbol where you want to Scan, spend 1 Energy, then reveal the new sector normally.
•  8 Energy Re-arm action: Once per turn as an action, you may spend 8 Energy to re-arm one of your used markers during your Action Phase. This upgrade improves to 5 Energy cost or 1 Energy cost in later tiers.
•  Tier	and	ship abilities cost 0 Energy: Any time you use a Tier or    ship ability, it costs 0 Energy. This upgrade improves Tier
ship abilities to free, as well as giving a 2,000   discount to Tier ships. This upgrade further improves, to allow you to upgrade a Ti-er	ship into a Tier	ship (for the price listed on the Tier	ship mat), which earns you a Fame Point as normal. You retain the Tier
ship ability and gain a second Tier	ship ability. The new Tier ship can upgrade into Tier	as normal, and you can continue ship upgrades as long as you have the Credits to spend.
Note: You can only upgrade to ships that you haven’t used yet in the campaign. If you’ve used all the ships of that tier at least once, then only upgrade to ships that you’ve used exactly one time, etc.

Overview
Xia is a 3-5 player, sandbox-style, competitive space adventure. Each player starts as a lowly (but hopeful!) captain of a small starship.

Captains ﬂy their ships about the system exploring new Sectors, completing various Missions, and battling other ships. Captains vie with each other for Titles, riches, and, most importantly, Fame.

The most adaptive, risk-taking, and creative captains will excel. One captain will rise above the others and become Legend.


Object of the Game
Captains achieve Victory through a Fame Point system. Captains earn Fame Points (@) in ten main ways:

Exploring, Rescue, Relics, Missions, Combat, Trade, Ships, Wealth, Titles, and Luck.


Each captain starts with their Marker on the Fame Point Track at 0 (Unknown). As captains claim Fame Points, they advance their Marker up the Fame Point Track.

When a captain’s Marker on the Fame Point Track reaches the space occupied by the Victory Token, the game is over and that captain is declared the winner.

Turn Overview
A captain’s turn consists of three Phases, completed in this order:

1. Action Phase this phase includes the bulk of movement, ﬁghting, using abilities, Missions and commerce. Some actions require activating a ship’s equipped Outﬁts or spending energy, others are free and may be attempted multiple times in the same phase. A captain may continue taking Actions until they cannot (or do not wish to) take further Actions, at which point their Action Phase ends.

2. Starport Phase (while at a Starport) The Starport Phase includes recharging/repairing the ship, buying/exchanging Outﬁts, and purchasing a new ship or Fame Points. If the captain is not at Starport (or is on a Dead World), the Starport Phase is skipped.

3. Status Phase A captain’s turn always ends with a Status Phase. During this phase, the captain re-arms Markers, refreshes Abilities and Impulse Tokens, draws Titles, counts Fame Points, and possibly claims victory!

After the captain’s Status Phase is completed, their turn is over. Play continues clockwise around the table with the captain sitting to their left.

A Word About Rules Integration…
The Embers expansion included fundamental Rules Changes that have been incorporated into these rules.

Missions are drawn during the Action Phase, but selected at the end of the turn.

Trade Selling cargo for @ requires the sale of all cubes a location can buy.

Respawning Ships respawn with damage equal to their tier and no longer lose a turn.



The rest of the expansion rules are modular. 

Where the rules refer to a speciﬁc expansion element, the rule is preceded by an indicator of which expansion the rule is from. Games that aren’t using those elements should ignore those rule sections.

How to Earn Fame Points
There are ten main ways that captains can gain Fame Points (@):
 Exploring Collect Exploration Tokens, some of which are worth 1@.
The Embers Exploration Tokens (if using) oﬀer diﬀerent
rewards when collected. When a captain accumulates two Exploration Tokens, they are immediately exchanged for either 1@ or 2,000%
Rescue Rescuing a Stranded captain is worth 1@.
Relics Sifting Relic Tokens at The Kiln oﬀers @ or other rewards.
 Relics and The Kiln are part of the Embers expansion rules.
Missions Each Mission completed is worth 1@.
Combat Destroying another ship is worth @ equal to the destroyed ship’s tier.
Trade Selling a Big Shipment of Cargo Cubes is worth 1@. A Big Shipment contains a minimum of 2 Cargo Cubes and all of the cubes in the ship’s hold that a location can buy. Selling less cubes is possible, but will not earn a @.

Ships Buying a new ship during the Starport Phase earns the captain 1@.
 Wealth During the Starport Phase a captain can Throw Some Credits Around
and spend 5,000% to earn 1@. Captains may not purchase the ﬁnal Fame Point needed for Victory.

Titles During the Status Phase, claiming Titles is worth 1@, 2@, or 3@.

Luck Whenever a captain rolls a natural 20 for any of their Ï[d20] rolls, they receive 1@. Maximum once per turn.

Setup
1. Shuﬄe the Sector Tiles. Deal one Sector tile per captain, placing them, one at a time, face up in the center of the play area. For each sector after the ﬁrst, line up its edge symbol to the previously laid Sector. 

If using Nyr, ﬁnd Nyr’s Sector tile and place it face up
in the center of the play area as the ﬁrst sector. Each	Setup without Nyr
additional Sector is placed adjacent to Nyr, matching its edge symbol to Nyr’s so that Nyr is in the center, surrounded by the other tiles.



Setup using Nyr


• If a Sector without a Spawn Point is drawn, re-shuﬄe it into the deck and draw another tile.


3

2. Shuﬄe the Relic Tokens and Exploration Tokens. Place an Exploration Token face down on any Exploration Spaces on the starting tiles.

3. Shuﬄe the Mission Cards, Title Cards, and (if using) Event Cards. Place the decks face down within reach of all captains.

4. Place the * Cargo Cubes, } Damage Markers / } Ice Damage Markers, Outfits, Mods, % Credits, and Dice £ ¢ § Ï within reach of all captains.

5. Give each captain one How to Win Card and 4,000% worth of Credits.

6. Shuﬄe the three NPC Cards (Enforcer, Merchant, and Scoundrel) and deal one face up to each captain. (In a 4 or 5-captain game, not everyone will get one.) Captains take the corresponding NPC miniature and place it on the NPC Card.

If using Nyr, place The Kiln’s NPC card in the play area and its miniature on the rules space of the Nyr sector tile.

7. Place the Fame Point Track (or the Event Fame Point Track) in the play area. 
 • Variable Game Length: At the beginning of the game, captains decide the
number of Fame Points needed for Victory by placing the Victory Token on the Fame Point Track at that number. Captains can decide to play a shorter game with fewer Fame Points, or a longer game with more Fame Points.

If using the Economy Board, determine the number of starting cubes for each cube type on the Economy board by rolling the £ [d6] for each cube type and placing that number of cubes on the space for that cube type.
8. Choose Ships - Separate the blue Tier 1 $ Ship Mats and matching Ship Ability Cards and miniatures. (Set the green Tier 2 ^ and purple Tier 3 & mats and cards aside for now.) Each captain rolls the Ï[d20]. The captain with the highest roll chooses a Tier 1 $ Ship Mat and takes the matching miniature and Ship Ability Card. This continues counter-clockwise around the table until each captain has chosen. All captains then place their miniatures on the Spawn Point of the Sector Tile closest to them.

9. Each captain takes an Impulse Token, a set of six Markers, and a Color Token.
 • The Impulse Token is placed face up (yellow side up) on the Ship Mat.

• One Marker is placed on the Fame Point Track at 0 (Unknown).

• One Marker is placed on the highest number of the Ship Mat’s Energy Meter.
 • The remaining four Markers are placed on the Ship Mat's Armed section.

• The Color Token is placed around their Ship’s Flight Stand.

10. In the same order as ship selection, each captain may now spend their Credits to purchase Outfits. The Outﬁts are placed in their Ship Mat’s Hold. Captains may only purchase what will ﬁt in the Hold. Captains are not required to spend all or any of their Credits at this point, but captains without an Engine Outﬁt will be at a disadvantage.

The captain who picked their ship last takes the First Player token; and 

• takes the ﬁrst turn.
Ship Overview
Each ship has a miniature, Ship Mat, Ship Ability Card, ﬁve Markers, an Impulse Token, and a Color Token. A ship contains a Hold that can store cargo and the various Outﬁts and Mods it will need to perform actions.

Ship Attributes: 1.Name

2.Tier Ships are either Tier 1$, 2^, or 3&.

3.Armed / Disarmed Spaces Armed spaces are used to hold Markers that are currently ready to be spent on Outﬁts. Disarmed spaces hold Markers that are waiting to be Armed.

4.Price The amount of Credits a captain has to pay to purchase the ship.

5.Hold Size Hold Size is a quick reference for how many spaces are in the Hold. A ship with damage equal to its Hold size is destroyed.
6.Impulse Space / Value The Impulse Space is where the Impulse
Token is placed. The Impulse Value represents the number of spaces a ship may move without spending Energy. (See Movement pg. 8.)
7.Hold The Hold is the ship’s cargo grid which represents the physical capacity of the ship. Outﬁts, Mods and Cargo Cubes are kept in the Hold. Each ship has a unique layout of Hold spaces. Captains will need to arrange Outﬁts in the Hold to maximize the use of space. A captain may not have more Cargo Cubes, Relics, Mods, or Outﬁts than they have space for in their Hold.

8.Energy Meter This meter keeps track of the ship’s Energy.

9.Bounty Bounty Credits are placed here. Captains destroying this ship will receive the Bounty Credits as a reward.

10.Ship Ability Card A card detailing the ship’s unique special ability.


Markers

Markers are used to keep track of Fame and Energy.

At the start of the game, each captain places one Marker on the Fame Point Track at zero (Unknown), another on the highest number on their Energy Meter, and the last four on the Ship Mat on the spaces marked Armed.
Arming During the Status Phase, a captain may spend Energy to rearm used or disarmed Markers at a cost of one Energy per Marker. A captain can arm as many Markers as they desire, up to the maximum of 4. To Arm, the captain simply moves their Energy Marker down one space and moves the chosen Marker to an Armed space on their Ship Mat.





















Disarming During the Status Phase, any Markers that have not been Armed are placed on Disarmed spaces. After the Status Phase, no Markers should be left on Outﬁts.

Energy Meter

Energy is spent to arm Markers, use Abilities, and scan new Sector Tiles.

Spending To spend Energy, move the Marker down the Energy Meter the number of spaces required.

Recharging During the Starport Phase, ships at Starports may replenish their Energy to maximum for free.

Ships that have no Energy and no Armed Markers are considered Stranded. (See Stranded pg. 8.)

Impulse Token

This double-sided token is used to keep track of when a captain has used their Impulse movement.

Impulse Tokens are refreshed during the Status Phase.


Color Token

Color Tokens are used to help diﬀerentiate ships on the board. They ﬁt over the ﬂight stand of a ship’s miniature.

4
Outfits and Mods
Ships use Outfits to move, defend, haul cargo, and attack. Outﬁts come in six types: Engines, Blasters, Missiles, Shields, Armor Plating, and Cargo Pods.
Mods are special 1x1 sized outﬁts that have special abilities or modify the abilities of other Outﬁts.

How Outfits and Mods Work

Placement Each Section of an Outfit or Mod takes up one space in the Hold. All of an outﬁt’s sections must ﬁt within the ship’s Hold.

Exceptions:

• Armor Plating / Cargo Pods must have 1 section in the Hold and 3 outside of the Hold.

• Shield Piercer Mods are placed over a Use Space on a Blaster/Missile Outﬁt.

• Enviro-Shld Mods are placed over a Use Space on a Shield Outﬁt.


Outﬁts that do not ﬁt in the Hold may not be taken aboard ship. Most Outﬁts are double sided and can be positioned with either side facing up. Captains will need to be creative to ﬁt certain conﬁgurations of Outﬁts in their Hold.


Using Outﬁts and Mods Captains can activate their ship’s Outﬁts/Mods in any order. A captain may use any, all, or none of
their Outﬁts/Mods during the Action Phase of their turn.
To Activate an Outﬁt or Mod, a captain moves a Marker from an Armed Space on the Ship Mat to an available Use Space on the Outﬁt or Mod being activated. The captain then rolls the corresponding die for that Outﬁt (or the Outﬁt that the Mod is on). The Action is then completed by resolving the die roll.

Use Space An available Use Space is one with orange circles and without Markers or Damage on it. If an Outﬁt does not have any available Use Spaces, then it cannot be used.
This tier 1Blaster has been
used twice this turn and cannot be used again because it has no more Use Spaces available.


Damage to Outfits and Mods

Damage Markers can be placed on any Section of an Outﬁt or Mod. If placed on a Section that contains a Marker, the Marker is moved to a Disarmed space on the Ship Mat. (See Damage, Destruction, and Respawning pg. 14.)

• Use Spaces that have Damage cannot be used. 

• Each Damage Marker on an Outﬁt reduces its rolls by 1 (rolls cannot be reduced below 1).

• Damage, once placed may not be shifted or relocated, it must be repaired.
 • Damaged Outﬁts/Mods may not be sold.

• Damaged Outﬁts/Mods may not be Rearranged in the ship’s hold.
 • Outﬁts/Mods may not be placed on spaces with damage markers.

Outﬁts/Mods are not destroyed when they are fully covered by Damage Markers; they are simply unusable until repaired

This tier 1 Engine has 1 Damage Marker on it. If a captain activated it and rolled a 4 on the d6, the result would be reduced by 1 for each Damage Marker on the unit - in this case 1, so the end result would be 3 Movement Points.


This Tier I shield cannot be used because damage covers both of its Use spaces.



Damage markers can also be placed in spaces in the ship’s Hold. If the space was empty, there is no additional eﬀect. 

A ship whose total number of damage markers equals or exceeds its hull size is immediately destroyed.

If a hold space receiving a damage marker was previously occupied by cargo (a Cargo Cube or a Relic), the cargo is immediately Jettisoned.






Jettisoned Cargo Cubes are placed on the same sector as the ship jettisoning them and may not be picked up by the same ship this turn.

Jettisoned Relic Tokens are removed from the game.
5
Action Phase

During their Action Phase, captains take Actions. To take an Action, the captain:
 • Declares the Action they are taking;

• Spends required Energy/Armed Markers and Rolls any associated dice
 • Resolves the Action’s eﬀects

Minor Actions (M) may be taken during movement without ending movement.

Example A captain uses an Engine Outﬁt and rolls a 5. They may move 3 spaces, take a Blind Jump (M), move 1 space, collect an Exploration Token (M), and move one ﬁnal space.

All other Standard Actions end movement (unspent movement points are lost).

Example A captain uses an Engine Outﬁt and rolls a 5. They move 1 space, and then take a Scan Sector Action, which ends their movement, preventing them from moving the ﬁnal four spaces.

Luck Whenever a captain rolls a natural 20 for any of their Ï[d20] rolls, they receive 1@. Maximum once per turn.

Actions
Movement (See Movement pg. 8.)

Fire Main Engine Spend Armed Markers on Engine Outﬁts to move.
Impulse Exhaust an Impulse Token to move spaces equal to the ship’s Impulse value without spending energy.

Blind Jump (M) When adjacent to an unexplored edge with unspent movement: declare a destination hex, draw a new Sector, place it, and move into the destination hex, resolving any eﬀects.

Resolve Border/Path Eﬀect (M) When a ship crosses a Border, the eﬀects are resolved immediately and then the rest of its movement is resolved. When a ship enters a Gravity Path or Comet Path, the path’s eﬀects are resolved immediately. Resolving these eﬀects can sometimes end movement but crossing borders/entering paths do not intrinsically end movement.

Use Gate (M) A ship on a Gate may spend 1 Movement point to travel through the Gate.

Exploring (See Exploring pg. 9.)
Scan Sector When adjacent to an unexplored edge, pay 1 energy to draw and place a new Sector Tile.

Collect Exploration Token (M) from Exploration Spaces. Tokens can provide @ or other rewards

Rescue A captain with at least 3 energy gives 2 Energy to an adjacent captain’s ship who has no Energy or Armed Markers. Earn 1@.


6

Missions (See Missions pg. 12.)

Draw (M) When on a Mission Point, draw three Mission Cards (placing them face down until the Status phase).

Reveal Objective Reveal an Active Mission Card and attempt its objectives.

Deliver Turn in a completed Active Mission for payment at the ﬁnal Mission Point shown on the card. Earn 1@.

Jettison (M) Discard an Active Mission Card. This may be done at any time.
 Attack Spend Armed Markers to attack using Outﬁts. (See Combat pg. 13.)

• Blasters (range 1)

• Missiles (range 2-6)

• Engines (via Ramming, range 1)

Destroying another ship earns @ equal to the Tier of the destroyed ship.

Shields Up (M) Activate a Shield Outﬁt for defense against an attack or board eﬀect.

Trade (See Trade pg. 15.)
Buy Cargo Cubes from a planet’s Buy Space. The cost is 1,000% for up to two Cargo Cubes.

Sell Cargo Cubes at a planet’s Sell Space. The captain receives 1,000% per Cargo Cube sold. 

Selling Big Shipments earns 1@. A Big Shipment contains a minimum of 2 Cargo Cubes and all of the cubes in the ship’s hold that a location can buy.


Collect (M) Cargo Cubes that are on a board space can be collected by a ship located in the same space as the Cargo Cube.

Jettison (M) Transfer any cargo cubes from the ship’s hold into the hex the ship occupies. Jettisoned Relics are destroyed (removed from the game).

Mine Cargo Cubes from the Mining Space in an Æ Asteroid sector.
 Harvest Cargo Cubes from the Harvest Space in a Ú Nebula sector.
 Salvage Cargo Cubes from the Salvage Space in a Â Debris sector.

Quarry Ember Cargo Cubes from the Quarry Space in an Æ Ice Asteroids sector.

Excavate Relics from { Dead Worlds.

Sift Relics at The Kiln, converting a Relic in the ship’s hold into @ or other rewards.

Other

Ship Ability Cards Use Ship Abilities designated as Actions.

Abilities from the Missions and Powers expansion are always active and are never placed face down.
Starport Phase

The Starport Phase is only available to Ships that end their Action Phase at a Starport. Starports exist at:

• Planets (any space inside a Planetary Shield); or 
 • The Kiln (any space inside the Kiln) 

Dead Worlds do not count as Planets - ships that end their Action Phase on Dead Worlds must skip the Starport Phase.

Captains at Starports may do any of the following, in any order, as many times as they can aﬀord:

Buy New Ship Purchase a ship that is exactly one tier higher than your current ship. A Tier 2^ ship costs 5,000%, and a Tier 3& costs 8,000%.
• Purchasing a new ship earns 1@.
• All of the old ship’s damage markers are discarded.
• All Ship Ability Cards, Outfits, Mods, Cargo Cubes, and Credits are transferred to the new ship.
• The old Ship Mat and miniature are removed from the game and are replaced by the new Ship Mat and miniature.

• The old ship’s Bounty is not transferred to the new ship. “New ship, who dis?”

Buy Outﬁts Purchase new Outﬁts or Mods, provided they ﬁt in the Hold.

Rearrange Hold Rearrange any or all undamaged Outﬁts/Mods and cargo in your hold into any legal conﬁguration. Neither Damage Markers nor Outﬁts/ Mods with Damage Markers can be rearranged.

Recharge Energy Recharge their Energy Meter up to its maximum for free.

Repair Damage Pay to remove all normal Damage Markers } from your ship. Repairing a Tier 1$ or Tier 2^ ship costs 1,000%. Repairing a Tier 3& ship costs 2,000%.

Sell Outﬁts/Mods Sell any undamaged Outﬁt/Mod for half of its original cost, rounded up. Tier 1$ Outﬁts sell for 1,000%, tier 2^ for 1,000%, and tier 3& for 2,000%. Damaged Outﬁts cannot be sold; they must ﬁrst be repaired.

Thaw Remove all Ice damage } markers for free.



Wealth

Throw Some Credits Around Captains may purchase 1@ for 5,000%. Captains cannot purchase the ﬁnal Fame Point required for victory.

Status Phase

During the Status Phase, a captain completes the following steps in this order:

1. Freeze Ships with } Ice damage only - place 1 } in every undamaged space that is orthogonally adjacent to existing Ice damage (ice damage does not spread into spaces containing normal damage). If placing this damage completely ﬁlls a ship’s hold - the ship is immediately destroyed.

Titles are claimed and drawn during the Status Phase. Existing Titles are claimed before new Titles are drawn (i.e. a newly drawn Title cannot be claimed in the same Status Phase in which it was drawn).

2. Claim Existing Title Claim any unclaimed Titles earned during their turn. Titles are worth between 1@ to 3@ Fame Points.

3. Draw New Title Title Cards are drawn the ﬁrst time any captain’s Marker reaches a purple Title space on the Fame Point Track. 

Example The ﬁrst captain to reach 3 Fame Points will draw a Title Card, but the next captain to reach 3 Fame Points will not.

4. Refresh Exhausted Ship Ability Cards and Impulse Tokens are refreshed by ﬂipping them face up.

5. Arm Markers Arm any spent or Disarmed Markers by moving them onto the Armed Spaces of their Ship Mat.

• It costs one Energy to move each Marker to an Armed Space. If a Marker is not armed, it is placed on a Disarmed Space (no markers can be left on any Outﬁt’s Use spaces).

• Arming Markers while at a Starport is free - captains do not have to spend Energy. Dead Worlds are not Starports, so ships on Dead worlds must pay energy to rearm markers.
• A ship that is not at a Starport and does not have Energy cannot arm Markers and will need to use any remaining Armed Markers on its next turn to ﬁnd more energy. If this ship also has no Armed Markers, it is Stranded. (See Stranded pg. 8.)
6. In Demand Cargo (if using the Economy Board) When the Economy Board has one or more empty sections, place 1,000% on each empty section of the Economy Board. No section may ever have more than 1,000% on it. 

7. Select Active Mission Captains look at all their face down mission cards, select at least 1 Active Mission card, then discard down to their Active Mission Limit. (Default Active Mission Limit is 1, M-Comp units may increase this.)




7
Movement
Movement A ship’s Engine Outﬁts and Impulse Token generate Movement Points.

Movement Points Each Movement Point spent moves a ship one space. Captains may choose to end movement without spending all of their movement points. Standard Actions, if taken while moving, end that movement. Any unspent movement points are lost. Minor actions do not end movement.
Fire Main Engine A captain declares the Action and spends 1 Armed Marker, placing it on a free Use Space of an Engine Outﬁt. The captain rolls the associated die (displayed on the Outﬁt) and receives Movement Points equal to the die result. This amount is reduced by 1 for each Damage Marker present on the Engine. GTS Mods can increase this amount. The captain may then move as many spaces as they choose, up to the number of Movement Points rolled.

Impulse Tokens allow a captain to move without spending Energy or using their Armed Markers. To use Impulse, the Impulse Token must be face up (yellow side up). The captain ﬂips their Impulse Token face down (yellow-side down), and moves a number of spaces up to the ship’s Impulse value.
Impulse Tokens may only be used once per turn.
The Impulse Token is refreshed (placed face up) during the Status Phase.


While Moving

Minor Actions (M) may be taken while moving without ending the current movement. Minor actions include:


Blind Jump
	Collect Exploration Token
 Draw Missions
	Resolve Border/Path Eﬀect
 Collect Cargo
	Shields Up

Jettison Cargo/Mission 
	Use Gate

Standard Actions may be taken while moving but immediately end the current movement - any unspent Movement Points are lost. Moving after a Standard Action requires a new Engine Activation or use of an Impulse Token. 

Example a captain activates an Engine and rolls a 7. They move 4 spaces and then Buy Cargo Cubes. Their movement ends and the remaining 3 unspent Movement Points are lost.

• Other Ships A ship may move through spaces occupied by other ships. However, a ship may not end its movement in an occupied space.

• Using Occupied Action Hexes If a captain wants to take an action on a space that is currently occupied by another ship, they may take the Action from an adjacent hex, provided that they ﬁrst spend two movement points, and immediately end their movement. Essentially, the captain is moving to the occupied hex and back in order to perform the action. The action on the occupied hex may be attempted more than once, if desired. Unspent movement points afterwards are lost. In all other cases, declaring a non-minor

action while moving ends movement immediately. This prevents ships from blocking key spaces indeﬁnitely. Planetary Shields block adjacency, so Using an occupied hex through a shield is not possible.

• Captains must still roll for any Borders passed through when using an occupied space.	

Example A captain wishing to use an occupied Sell space takes a Fire Main Engine action, granting 5 movement. They use two of those to move adjacent to the occupied Sell space. They then spend two more movement to “use” the adjacent, occupied space, immediately taking a Sell action to Sell their Cargo Cubes as if they were on the occupied space, and their ﬁnal movement point is lost.

Resolve Border/Path Effect (M) While moving, a ship may pass (or attempt to pass) through a number of diﬀerent kinds of borders. If a Border requires a Ï[d20] roll, that roll is applied and resolved immediately. Movement then continues (if possible) directly after the roll is resolved.
(See Borders pg. 10 & pg. 20.)


< Ø > Planetary Shield eﬀects resolve when entering or exiting a shield. 


All other Borders (Ô Star, Æ Asteroid, Æ Ice Asteroid, Â Debris Fields, Ú Nebulae) resolve their eﬀects only when a ship enters the border.

Gravity / Comet Path Effects resolve immediately when a ship enters or re-enters these paths, before any other movement or actions take place.

Stranded

A captain who has no Energy and no Armed Markers is Stranded. A Stranded captain:

• May only use Impulse Engines for movement
 • Can only take Minor Actions
• Cannot take Standard Actions
If a captain becomes stranded while in the middle of moving (e.g. by entering a Nebula) their movement ends and any unspent Movement Points are lost.

A captain stops being Stranded when they gain 1 or more Energy or Armed Markers, (e.g. by being Rescued or Recharging Energy while at a Starport).


Rescue
A captain rescuing a Stranded ship must be adjacent to it and have at least 3 Energy (a captain cannot Rescue a ship if the action will make them Stranded).

Rescue a Stranded Captain Transfer 2 Energy to a Stranded ship and receive 1@. The Stranded captain cannot refuse this help.
The rescued captain may immediately Arm Markers with their newly received Energy.

8
Exploring

Add New Sectors

To explore new Sectors of the system, a ship needs to be on a space that is adjacent to an unexplored edge, with at least one Sector tile left in the deck.

Unexplored Edge An unexplored edge is any edge space that does not touch another Sector tile.

Once positioned on a space adjacent to an unexplored edge, either:

Scan Spend 1 Energy and draw a Sector Tile from the Sector Deck. The Sector Tile is ﬂipped face up, and a Symbol from the drawn tile is matched with the Symbol on same Sector Tile edge as the captain’s ship.

• Captains may not Scan through	When placing a new tile, the Planetary Shields (Planetary Shields                           symbol of the new tile (2)
must match the symbol of
block adjacency).

Blind Jump (M) Jump onto a new Sector Tile	the exploring ship’s tile (1). before knowing what it is. The captain declares the unexplored edge into which they want to move, indicates which hex they will move to, and spends 1 movement. They then draw a Sector Tile, match the Symbol, and place the Sector Tile. The captain must move their ship into the hex they declared at the beginning of the Blind Jump and resolve any consequences.

Example A captain that Blind Jumps into a Star is immediately destroyed – they can’t choose to abort the Blind Jump.


Exploration Tokens

Placing When a newly drawn Sector Tile has one or more Exploration Spaces, an Exploration Token is taken face down from the pile and
placed on each Exploration Space, still face down. Do not reveal Exploration Tokens when placing new Sectors.
Exploring The ﬁrst captain to move their ship onto the Exploration Space ﬂips the Exploration Token face up, claims their reward, and places the Exploration Token on their Ship Mat.

After resolving an Exploration Token, if a captain has 2 Exploration Tokens face up on their ship mat (after resolving the one just collected) they discard
both tokens (remove from the game) and gain either 1@ OR 2,000%.

Planets and Planetary Entrances
The core game has seven planets: < Lunari, < Kemplar II, Ø Azure, Ø Doravin V,
Ø Neo Damascus, > Loath, and > Smugglers’ Den (an asteroid that has the same rules as a planet). 

The Embers expansion adds two more planets: Ø Tig and > Kei. 

Xia has three types of planets: < Lawful (blue), > Outlaw (red), Ø Neutral (green).
 Planets have	and Sell Spaces for buying and selling Cargo Cubes.

All spaces on a planet (inside the Planetary Shield) are considered a Starport. Ships that end their Action Phase at a Starport may take a Starport Phase.

< Ø > Planet Entrances (Blocks Line of Sight, Blocks Adjacency) Planetary Entrances are dashed, glowing lines in red, green, or blue. 

< Lawful (blue) Any Outlaw ship (a ship with a Bounty) cannot enter (but may exit) through the Planetary Entrance. Outlaw ships may still
try to enter illegally through the Planetary Shield.

> Outlaw (red) Any Innocent ship (a ship without a Bounty) that passes through the Planetary Entrance receives +1,000% Bounty (=).
Ø Neutral (green) These planets have no special rules.

=Bounties
All Captain’s Ships start without Bounties- they are Innocent.

Ships that commit illegal acts will accrue Bounties and become Outlaws.

= Raiding Destroying an Innocent ship adds 1,000% to a captain’s Bounty.

= Evading Crossing a Planetary Shield instead of using the legal Planetary Entrance, risks adding 1,000% to a captain’s Bounty.

= Crime Outlaw Missions specify a Bounty for either completing or failing the Mission, +1,000-2,000 % Bounty (varies by mission).

= Associating With Outlaws An Innocent ship passing through the Planetary Entrance of an Outlaw planet receives +1,000% Bounty

Ships with Bounties get an Outlaw Token on their ﬂight stand to mark them as Outlaws.

Outlaw ships may not enter Lawful Planets via their Entrance.


•Claiming a Bounty A captain who destroys an outlaw ship claims all credits in the outlaw’s Bounty. If the attacking captain is also destroyed (e.g. is destroyed in a Ram attack), the Bounty is unclaimed and is simply discarded.

• Removing a Bounty Bounties are removed if the ship is destroyed or when a
captain purchases a new ship.


9
Borders
While moving, a ship may encounter diﬀerent kinds of borders.

Some borders can aﬀect Adjacency and Line of Sight determinations.


Resolve Border/Path Effect When a ship moves through (or attempts to move through) a Border that requires a Ï[d20] roll, that roll is applied and resolved immediately. If the ship still has Movement Points afterwards, they continue moving directly after the Ï[d20] roll is resolved.





Block Line of Sight

< Ø > Planetary Shields
 Æ Asteroids
Â Debris Fields


Block Adjacency

< Ø > Planetary Shields

Double Traversal When a ship crosses two borders with a single Movement point, the captain applies the appropriate eﬀects for both of them in the order they are crossed. 

Example A captain moves one space, exiting through a Planetary Shield and entering a Nebula. The captain ﬁrst rolls for the Planetary Shield and applies the outcome; then, they roll for the Nebula and apply the outcome.




Æ Ice Asteroids Ô Star
Passing through (or attempting to pass through) some borders triggers an eﬀect, which is resolved immediately.

< Ø > Planetary Shield borders aﬀect movement when the ship is entering or exiting the shield. 

All other Borders apply eﬀects only when a ship enters the border.


Border	Ï[d20] Eﬀect	Defense?

< Ø > Planetary   1-10 Damage (}), ship does not move,	None Shield (Entering	but 1 Movement Point is spent
        (Unblockable)
or Exiting)	11-17 Move and +1,000% Bounty = 18-20 Move and no damage or bounty

Damage eﬀects (} or }) are applied immediately. The amount of damage is the number on the Ï[d20] roll.

Shield outﬁts may be used to reduce damage from: Æ Asteroids or Æ Ice Asteroids. Damage from Planetary Shields is Unblockable.

Energy loss from Nebulae (	) is applied immediately. The amount of energy loss is the number on the Ï[d20] roll.

Shield outﬁts may be used to reduce energy loss from Ú Nebulae.
If a ship does not have enough Energy on their Energy Meter to satisfy the roll, Armed Markers are disarmed (one per Energy lost), and moved to the Disarmed section of the Ship Mat. If a ship loses all its energy and has no Armed Markers, the ship is immediately Stranded - any unspent movement is lost. Impulse Tokens are not aﬀected by Nebulae.

Ò Gates
Ships may move through Gates as if they were Normal Space.

Use Gate A captain (or NPC) on a space within a Gate’s green border may spend 1 Movement point to travel to any space on another Gate. (Exception The Tigris gate cannot be chosen as a destination.)
Gate special movement is not considered when determining Adjacency, Range, or Line of Sight.

The ﬁrst captain to use a Gate (other than Tigris) earns 1@.


Tigris The Tigris Gate is malfunctioning and does not connect to other Gates. Instead, captains using the Tigris Gate roll a Ï[d20] and are placed on the unoccupied Spawn Point closest to the roll (on a tie, choose the higher-numbered Spawn Point). On a roll of 20, the captain may choose any Spawn Point (in addition to receiving 1 Fame Point for Luck.)

The ﬁrst captain to use the Tigris Gate earns 1@.

Dead Worlds and Relics

Dead Worlds

Dead Worlds have no planetary shields and all ships may travel across them freely.

No Starport Phase Ships that end their Action Phase on a Dead World must skip the Starport Phase.
When a Dead World is discovered, place Relic Tokens equal to the number speciﬁed on the world’s Relic Token Space (3 or 4).

Relic Token Space While Relic tokens are
present, these spaces act as occupied normal space (ships can ﬂy through it, but cannot end movement there.)


Relics

Relics represent treasures from ancient alien civilizations.

Captains can take an Excavate action on Excavate spaces of
Dead Worlds. A captain must have 2 orthogonally adjacent empty spaces in their cargo hold to take an Excavate action.

Excavate While a ship is on the Excavate space of a Dead World with Relic Tokens, roll the Ï[d20] to determine the result. Shield Outﬁts can reduce Ice Damage from Excavation actions.

Relic Tokens take up 2 cargo spaces in a ship's hold. 

Relics may be Jettisoned. If a space holding a Relic Token is damaged, that token is Jettisoned automatically. Jettisoned Relics are immediately destroyed (removed from the game).

Relics must be taken to The Kiln to be Sifted. A sifted Relic Token is revealed and converted into rewards like Cargo Cubes, Mods or @.

Sift While docked with The Kiln, as a Standard Action, a captain may Sift any Relic Tokens in their hold. Sifting removes a Relic from the ship’s hold, ﬂips it face up, and the captain must choose to receive 1@ OR the rewards shown. Any rewards that will not ﬁt in the Ship’s hold (cubes/mods) are ignored. Sifted Relic Tokens are removed from the game.

Sifted Relic Tokens are worth: 
 •  1@ OR 3,000%
•  1@ OR 2,000% + 2 Speciﬁed Cubes
 •  1@ OR 2,000% + Speciﬁed Mod

11

Gravity Paths

Anomaly Sectors
Anomaly sectors have very concentrated gravity, represented by dashed purple or orange paths.

Entering Whenever any captain (not NPC) moves from a space not on the gravity path onto any space on the gravity path, they must roll the die speciﬁed and move their ship that many spaces down the path.

Actions Captains may not take any actions (minor or otherwise) while the gravity path’s forced movement is being resolved.


Example Puddle Jumper moves onto the outer path (purple) of Ferren’s Call with 4 movement left over. The ship immediately rolls for the purple gravity path, rolling the d12. The roll is a 8, moving the ship 5 spaces along the path, the 6th movement causes the ship to move oﬀ of the end of the path, the extra 2 movement from the gravity path is discarded.
The ship has now entered the inner (orange) ring and must immediately roll the d6 and move along that path. After the d6 forced movement is resolved (if the ship survives), the captain can use the 4 movement they had left over when entering the path.

Comets and Comet Paths Each Ice Asteroid sector contains 1 Comet. When the sector is ﬁrst revealed, place a comet on the special rules space.

Whenever any captain (not NPC) moves from a space not on the comet path onto any space on the comet path, immediately roll the £ [d6] and move that Comet the number of spaces along the path.

Actions Captains may not take any actions (minor or otherwise) while the comet’s movement is being resolved.

If a Comet ends movement on a space with a ship or Cargo Cube, that ship or cube is instantly destroyed. Surviving ships may then continue moving normally. 

If a moving ship enters a space with a Comet, it is destroyed.

Missions
Completing Missions allows captains to earn Credits and Fame Points. Missions come in a variety of Types and can be Lawful Missions or Outlaw Missions.

Normally, a ship has an Active Mission Limit of one, meaning it can hold only a single Active Mission at a time. 

How to Get Missions

Draw (M) While on a Mission Point #, a captain without an Active Mission (or with less Active Missions than their current Active Mission Limit) can draw three Mission Cards as a Minor Action. The cards are placed face down in front of them until their next Status phase. They may do this once per Mission Point per turn. A captain who lands on multiple Mission Points in the same turn may perform this Minor Action multiple times, each time the three newly drawn cards are added to any face down cards they already have.

Select Active Mission During the Status Phase, a captain with 1 or more facedown Mission Cards may look at them before selecting at least 1 to be their Active Mission card. Afterwards, they must discard down to their Active Mission Limit. 

The Active Mission Limit can be increased by purchasing M-Comp Mods.


Example A captain with no Active Missions ﬂies over 2 Mission points and takes the Draw action twice. They draw a total of 6 cards (looking at none of them). During the Status Phase, they look at all 6 cards and keep 1, discarding the rest. If they had a M-Comp Mod, they could keep up to 3 missions.

Completing Missions


Losing Missions

Jettison A captain may discard active missions at any time (also discarding any Credits on the mission card). Some missions have Penalties for discarding them after they have been revealed (e.g. Transport missions).

Dying with drawn missions If a ship is destroyed, discard all its Active Missions and all of its face down mission cards without looking at them.


Experience

Directly after taking a Mission Action that requires a Ï[d20] roll: The captain may discard one of their previously completed Missions of the same type and roll the Ï[d20] again, keeping only this new result.

Example A captain who has already completed 2 Research Missions attempts a third Research Mission. When taking the Research Action, they roll the d20 and receive a 2. They discard one of their previously completed Research cards to re-roll the d20 and receive a 3. They then spend their ﬁnal remaining Research card and re-roll the d20 one more time, receiving a result of 16.

Missions without Ï[d20] rolls are not aﬀected by Experience.


Missions vary, but typically require ﬂying to a speciﬁc Mission Point #, attacking a speciﬁc target, or obtaining a speciﬁc cargo before Revealing the Objective of the Active Mission. Many missions will require that the ship Deliver the mission to a diﬀerent Mission Point # in order to collect Payment.

Reveal Objective Once the Mission’s Start Conditions are met, Reveal the Active Mission (as a Standard Action) and complete any required roll at that time. If payment is conditional on Delivery, the rewards are placed on the revealed Mission Card.

Deliver With the Mission Card Revealed, a captain at the speciﬁed Delivery Mission Point # can Deliver the mission as a Standard Action, ending their current movement.

Payment After completing a Mission, a captain receives the payment on the Mission Card and 1@. For some Outlaw Missions, the captain’s Bounty may (=) increase. Slide the completed Mission under the captain’s Ship Mat so that just the mission type is visible; it is no longer considered Active.


12
Combat
Combat is carried out in six steps:

1. Acquire Target The attacker chooses a single target that is within Range.

• Range is counted from the Attacking ship to the Defending ship in spaces on the game board. Adjacent ships are at range 1. Some Ship Abilities can be used as attacks; the Ship Ability Card will specify the Range of these attacks.

The attacker must also have Line of Sight to the target:
• Line of Sight A ship is within Line of Sight if a straight line can be drawn from the center of the attacking ship’s space to the center of the target ship’s space without crossing a Border that blocks line of sight.
• Ô Stars, Æ Asteroids, Æ Ice Asteroids, Â Debris Fields, and < Ø > Planetary Shields/Entrances all block Line of Sight.

• No other board elements block line of sight (e.g. Ú Nebulae, Ò Gates, other ships, Mission Markers, Spawn Points, etc do not block line of sight).

• Line of sight cannot be drawn across areas without a sector (unexplored space).

If the attacker is within Range and has a clear Line of Sight, they may proceed to Declare Attack.


Adjacency
Ships are considered adjacent when they occupy spaces that are directly next to each other.

< Ø > Planetary Shields/Entrances block adjacency Two ships on opposite sides of a Planetary Shield or Entrance are not considered to be adjacent to each other for the purpose of Attacks, Missions, and Special Abilities.



Some Actions only require being adjacent to the target.

Example For a Thief Mission’s “Steal” Action -only being adjacent is required. This means if the target ship is inside an Asteroid space, the Action can still take place. However, an Action that requires Line of Sight, such as using a Blaster against the target, could not be taken.







2. Declare Attack The attacker declares their target and how many Outﬁts and/or Abilities they are using for the Attack Action. The attacker then spends any required Armed Markers/Energy at this time. Captains can combine oﬀensive attacks into one attack or spread them out into separate attacks.

3. Declare Defense The Defending ship may use Shield Outﬁts and/or Abilities as defense. The Defender spends any required Armed Markers/Energy. If Shields or Abilities are not declared in this step, they can’t be used after the Attack Roll.

4. Roll After both Attacker and Defender make their declarations, roll the dice associated with the Outﬁts/ Abilities they declared during Steps 2 and 3. The Attacker rolls ﬁrst, followed by the Defender.

5. Resolve Damage Subtract the Defense Value from the Attack Value to calculate the Damage taken by the Defender. The Defender applies a damage marker to their ship for each point of damage taken. (See Damage pg. 14.)
Attack Value The total of the Attacker’s roll and its modiﬁers. Defense Value The total of the Defenders roll and its modiﬁers.

6. Re-Arm Defenders who have spent Armed Markers on Shield Outﬁts during Step 3 may immediately re-arm any of those spent Markers at a cost of 1 Energy per Marker. Re-Armed Markers are placed on Armed Spaces. Any Markers that are not Re-Armed are placed on Disarmed spaces. This does not apply to Markers spent in previous Actions.
The Attack Action is now over.

Line of Sight Example Numerator (A) has Line of Sight to
every hex colored in green. Numerator has Line of
C
Sight on Gaiden (B) at Range 1, and Easy Tiger (C) at
Range 4, but not on Nightshade (D) at Range 3, or
Swamp Rat (E) at Range 3.
Combat Example

1. Acquire Target Puddle Jumper (brown) checks if they can attack Gaiden (red). Gaiden is at Range 1, which allows them to use their Blaster. There is a Nebula Border between them, but that does not aﬀect Line of Sight, so they can proceed with the Attack.



2. Declare Attack Puddle Jumper declares they are attacking Gaiden with their Blaster twice, spending two Markers in one Attack.



3. Declare Defense Gaiden declares they are defending
with their ship’s Evasive Thrusters Ability and their Shield, spending one Marker to use the latter (they could have spent up to three to increase their defense even more).



4. Roll Both captains roll their dice.

• Puddle Jumper rolls one £ [d6] for each Marker placed on the Blaster Outﬁt’s Use Spaces (two dice). Puddle Jumper gets a 6 and a 5, for a total
Attack Value of 11.

• Gaiden rolls one ¢ [d8] for each Marker placed on their Shield Outﬁt’s Use Spaces (one die), and a Ï[d20] for their ship’s Ability (Evasive Thrusters). They get a 3 on the Shield, and a 7 for the Ability roll (which, according to
the Evasive Thrusters Ship Ability Card, prevents 5 damage), for a total Defense Value of 8.

5. Resolve The Defense Value (8) is subtracted from the Attack Value (11), for a remainder of 3. Gaiden must place 3 Damage Markers (}) in their Hold on spaces of their choice.

6. Re-Arm Gaiden now chooses to spend one Energy to re-arm the Marker used on the Shield Outﬁt.

The Attack Action is now over.

Damage, Destruction, and Respawning

Damage

Damage Markers (}) are used to keep track of how much damage a ship has sustained.

Destroyed When a ship has received } (or }) equal to or in excess of its number of Hold spaces, the ship is immediately destroyed.
Taking Damage Ships take damage in the form of Damage Markers (}). Each } represents one point of damage. The captain receiving the damage places Damage Markers into their ship’s Hold. Each } takes 1 Hold space. Any Hold space with a } is unusable until Repaired. (See Starport Phase pg. 18.) The captain receiving the damage chooses where to place the }s in the Hold.

If the } is placed on an…
Empty Hull Space No additional eﬀect.
Hold Space Containing a Cargo Cube the Cube is Jettisoned (set it on the board in the same space as the ship).
Hold Space Containing a Relic the Relic is Jettisoned and immediately destroyed (removed from the game).

Outﬁts Damage Markers can be placed on any Section of an Outﬁt. Each Section of the Outﬁt can hold one }. Damage Markers on an Outﬁt cause that Outﬁt to become less eﬀective. Each } placed on an Outﬁt reduces rolls by 1

Example A Blaster Outﬁt with 2} rolls a 5; this counts as a 3 because of the 2}.

Outﬁt’s Use Space A Use Space with a damage marker is no longer usable until repaired. Any Markers on the Use space are immediately moved to a Disarmed Space.


Ice Damage

Ice Damage (}) is placed like normal damage and has the same eﬀects on spaces where it is placed. 

Ice damage is removed during a Thaw and it spreads by Freezing.

Thaw During the Starport Phase captains may remove all ice damage for free (only available to Ships that end their Action Phase at a Starport).
Freezing During the Status Phase, place 1 Ice damage (}) in every space that is orthogonally adjacent to existing ice damage. If, due to Freezing, a ship’s hold is entirely full of damage (} or }) the ship is immediately destroyed. When Freezing, spaces with normal damage should be ignored; Ice damage does not spread into spaces containing normal damage.

14
Ship Destroyed

It happens. Speciﬁcally, when:

• A ship’s total damage (} or }) is equal to or greater than its number of Hold spaces.

• A ship resolves an Instant Death eﬀect (like failing a Salvage roll, or Blind Jumping into the star, Xia).

When a ship is destroyed:

• Keep all Outﬁts, Mods, Credits and Fame (these are not aﬀected).

• All of its Missions cards are discarded (Active and any drawn facedown). • Lose All Cargo.

All Cargo Cubes are Jettisoned in the same hex where the ship was destroyed (Cargo cubes dropped in Star Spaces are returned to Supply)

Relics that are Jettisoned are removed from the game.

• The ship’s Bounty is removed (if another captain destroyed the ship, they may claim it - otherwise any % are discarded).

• If it was the destroyed ship’s turn, the turn ends immediately.

• On the destroyed ship’s next turn - the ship Respawns (see below).


Claiming Rewards
The captain who destroys another ship claims @ equal to the destroyed ship’s tier number and collects any Bounty = on the destroyed ship.

…But You Gotta Survive If both the Attacker and Defender are destroyed during a Ramming Attack, the Attacker does not receive anything for the kill: No Bounty is collected, and no Fame Points are awarded.


Respawn

The turn after a ship is destroyed, it Respawns. Roll the Ï[d20] and place the ship on the unoccupied Spawn Point with the number closest to the number rolled. In the case of a tie, place the ship on the higher-numbered Spawn Point. On a roll of 20, the captain may choose which unoccupied Spawn Point to place the ship (in addition to the 1@ for Luck).

Ships respawn with: • Full Energy.

• All Markers are Armed.

• All Tokens and Ship Ability Cards are refreshed.
 • All Damage Markers are removed, then:

• The ship receives a set amount of unblockable damage, equal to the ship’s Tier. The ship’s captain chooses where to place the damage.

Trade
Captains can proﬁt by trading in Cargo Cubes and Relics for Credits and Fame.

Cargo Cubes represent goods that are traded throughout the system and are stored in empty spaces in the Hold of a ship, one Cargo Cube per space.

Relics can be Excavated from Dead Worlds and Sifted at The Kiln to receive Fame and other valuables. Relic Tokens take up 2 spaces in a Ship’s Hold.


Get Cargo

Buy While on a Planet’s Buy Space, captains can use a Buy Cargo Cubes Action to buy up to two of the speciﬁed Cargo Cubes for 1,000%. The captain must have enough empty space in their Hold. Captains may purchase as many Cargo Cubes as they desire, as long as they have enough Credits and space in the Hold. 

Smugglers Den sells Cargo Cubes of any color.
Supply Buy actions are limited to the cubes available on the Economy Board. If a cube type’s space is empty, it cannot be purchased until more of its type are Produced.

Mining, Harvesting, Salvaging, or Quarrying

Cargo Cubes can be obtained by Mining Asteroid Fields, Harvesting Nebula gasses, Salvaging technology from Debris Fields, and Quarrying
Ice Asteroids. Their ship must have at least one free space in their Hold. The captain then declares they are taking a Standard Action, which can be repeated as many times as the captain dares (some of these actions can be quite dangerous). Cubes obtained by these actions come from the general supply and not the Economy Board.

Collect Cargo Cubes that have been Jettisoned can be collected while on the same space as the Cargo Cubes. The captain may collect any number of Cubes in the space, as long as they have room in the Hold. A captain may not collect any Cargo Cubes they have jettisoned in the same turn.

Excavate Risk Ice Damage to Excavate Relic Tokens from Dead Worlds as often as you dare. Relics take up 2 spaces in the Hold.


15
Get Paid

Sell Cargo Cubes that match the icon on a planet’s Sell Space can be Sold at that planet’s Sell Space for 1,000% per Cargo Cube (Ember sells for 2,000% per Cargo Cube). 

Selling a Big Shipment of Cargo Cubes earns 1@.

A Big Shipment contains: 

• at least 2 Cargo Cubes; AND 

• all of the Cargo Cubes the current Sell space can buy.

A captain can choose to sell less Cargo Cubes than the location can buy, but they will not receive @ if they do.


Loath buys Cargo Cubes of any color, but Loath never Produces Cargo Cubes on the Economy Board.

Consume Sell actions cause each cube sold to be consumed by the purchasing planet - they are not placed on the Economy Board, but are placed in the general supply.

Produce Each time a planet consumes a cargo cube, it produces a new cube of the type the planet generates, taking it from supply and placing it on the Economy Board. Producing cubes that are in Demand earns 1,000%.

Each section on the Economy Board may hold a maximum of 6 cubes of that type. While a resource section is full, Sell actions do not cause cubes of that type to be produced.

Kei Cubes traded at the planet Kei are placed on the Economy Board. Cubes received in exchange are taken from the Economy Board (if no cubes or not enough are available, the trade cannot be made).
Sift Relics While docked with The Kiln, a captain may Sift any Relic Tokens in their hold. Sifting removes a Relic from the ship’s hold, ﬂips it face up, and the captain must choose to receive 1@ OR the rewards shown. Any rewards that will not ﬁt in the Ship’s hold (Cubes/Outﬁts/Mods) are ignored.

Lose Cargo

Jettison (M) Remove any or all Cargo Cubes or Relics from a ship’s Hold. Place Jettisoned Cargo Cubes on the game board on the same space as the jettisoning ship. A captain that jettisons Cargo Cubes cannot pick those cubes up in the same turn. Jettisoned Relics are removed from the game.

Destroyed Ships immediately Jettison all Cargo Cubes and Relics.

Damage If a Damage Marker (} or }) is placed in a Hold Space currently holding a Cargo Cube or Relic Token, the cube or token is immediately Jettisoned.



16

Mine / Harvest / Salvage / Quarry
There are ways to obtain Cargo Cubes other than Buying them. The captain must be on a Mining, Salvage, Harvest, or Quarry Space and have at least one free space in their Hold. The captain declares a Standard Action appropriate to the space the ship is currently on and rolls a Ï[d20] to determine the results:

Mine from [Æ Asteroid Fields ] A captain attempts to match velocity and trajectory with an asteroid in order to mine the valuable minerals and alloys:

1-10 (Failure): The ship receives the number rolled as Damage (}). (The ship collided with an asteroid.) Shield Outﬁts and Special Abilities may
be used after the roll to mitigate this Damage.

11-20 (Success): The ship receives one Cargo Cube of the type displayed on the Mining Space. Captains may attempt to Mine a single
Mining Space multiple times within their turn.

Harvest from [Ú Nebulae] A captain attempts to harvest the elusive gasses that collect near the nebula’s more volatile regions:

1-10 (Failure): The ship loses Energy equal to the number rolled. (An electrostatic anomaly has absorbed the ship’s Energy.) Shield Outﬁts
and Special Abilities may be used to mitigate this Energy loss.

If the captain does not have enough Energy, they must disarm Armed Markers (one per Energy lost). If their total Energy and Armed Markers are less than the roll, the captain’s move ends and they are immediately Stranded.
11-20 (Success): The ship receives one Cargo Cube of the type displayed on the Harvest Space. Captains may attempt to Harvest a single Harvest Space multiple times within their turn.

Salvage from [Â Debris Fields] A captain attempts to pick through the hazardous remains of past battles and derelict ships to try to ﬁnd something of value in the old wreckage:

1-3 (Failure): The ship is immediately destroyed. (A leftover space mine or unstable reactor has detonated!) This cannot be prevented with
Shield Outﬁts or Special Abilities.

4-20 (Success): The ship receives one Cargo Cube of the type displayed on the Salvage Space. Captains may attempt to Salvage a
single Salvage Space multiple times within their turn.

Quarry from [Æ Ice Asteroids]

1-10 (Failure): The ship receives the number rolled as Ice Damage (}). Shield Outﬁts and Special Abilities may be used after the roll to mitigate
this Damage.

11-20 (Success): The ship receives one Ember Cargo Cube. Captains may attempt to Quarry a single Quarry Space multiple times within their
turn.
Non-Player Ships (NPCs)
Non-player ships (the Enforcer, the Scoundrel, and the Merchant) are autonomous ships that are controlled by sets of rules. The NPC Card for each are dealt out at the beginning of the game. (See Setup pg. 3.) A captain dealt an NPC card is responsible for carrying out that NPC’s Actions throughout the game. NPC decisions are pre-determined -captains responsible for an NPC’s actions may not alter them to their advantage.


Spawning

NPCs Spawn only when the speciﬁc Sector Tile on their NPC Card has been placed on the board. Spawning NPCs appear on the Spawn Point of their Sector (if occupied, they appear on an adjacent unoccupied space). If an NPC is destroyed, it Respawns the following turn on a random, unoccupied Spawn Point with all damage markers removed.


NPC Actions

Movement NPCs will begin their action by selecting a target speciﬁed on their NPC card. They then move towards their target via the safest, most direct route. NPCs always take the most direct route to their targets. If there is more than one most-direct route, the captain controlling that NPC determines the path.

• NPCs can use Ò Gates.

• Ú Nebulae do not aﬀect NPCs.

• NPCs will avoid: Ô Stars, Æ Asteroids, Æ Ice Asteroids, Â Debris Fields, and < Ø > Planetary Shields.

NPCs cannot
• take Scan or Blind Jump Actions.
 • move into unexplored Sector Tiles.

Gravity Paths do not aﬀect NPCs.

NPCs entering Comet Paths do not trigger comet movement.


Unreachable Sectors It is possible for there to be Sectors that are unreachable by NPCs without crossing through a Border. In this case, the NPC will move through the safest / most direct path to reach that Sector. The safest path is determined in this order: Asteroids, Debris, then, as a last resort, Planetary Shields. NPCs must apply eﬀects of these Borders in the same way a captain would.

• NPCs use shields to reduce damage from board eﬀects.



NPCs in Combat

Defense Attacked NPCs automatically defend using the defense speciﬁed on their NPC Card.

Damage If damaged, Damage Markers (}) are placed on the NPC’s Card. When the number of } on the card equals or exceeds the NPC’s ‘To Kill’ number, the NPC is destroyed.

Destroyed NPCs are immediately removed from the game board. The captain who destroyed the NPC takes any Credits and Fame Points speciﬁed in the green “On Kill” section of the NPC Card. 

•NPCs Respawn on the turn after their destruction, respawning at a random, unoccupied spawn point as if they’d just entered the game.

•If one NPC destroys another NPC, the Credits on the destroyed NPC’s Card are taken and placed on the attacking NPC’s Card.

Example The Enforcer destroys the Scoundrel. Any Credits on the Scoundrel’s NPC Card are placed on the Enforcer’s NPC Card.

Titles
Titles are claimed and drawn during the Status Phase. Existing Titles are claimed before new Titles are drawn (i.e. a newly drawn Title cannot be claimed in the same Status Phase in which it was drawn).

Titles are worth between 1@ to 3@ Fame Points.

Skills In addition to granting a captain Fame Points, each Title gives a captain a Skill. Skills are immediately available to the Title holder.


Claiming The ﬁrst captain to complete the Title’s objective (as listed on the Title Card) may claim it during the Status Phase. The captain takes the Title
Card and receives the Fame Point(s) and Skill listed on the card. Captains may claim multiple Titles during the Status Phase as long as they meet all necessary objectives. A claimed title is no longer available for other captains to claim.

Drawing The purple spaces on the Fame Point Track are Title spaces. The ﬁrst captain to move their Marker onto or past a Title space draws a Title Card during the Status Phase, reads it aloud, and places it face up in the play area within view of all captains. It is now available for any captain to claim.
Example The ﬁrst captain to reach 3 on the Fame Point Track draws a Title Card, reads it aloud, and places it on the table. The next captain to reach 3 on the Fame Point Track does not draw a new Title Card.

17
Starport Phase
The Starport Phase is only available to Ships that end their Action Phase at a Starport. Starports exist at:

• Planets (any space inside a Planetary Shield); or 
 The Kiln (any space inside the Kiln) 

Dead Worlds do not count as Planets - ships that end their Action Phase on Dead Worlds must skip the Starport Phase.

Captains at Starports may do any of the following, in any order, as many times as they can aﬀord:

Buy New Ship Purchase a ship that is exactly one tier higher than your current ship. A Tier 2^ ship costs 5,000%, and a Tier 3& costs 8,000%.
• Purchasing a new ship earns 1@.
• All of the old ship’s damage markers are discarded.
• All Ship Ability Cards, Outfits, Mods, Cargo Cubes, and Credits are transferred to the new ship.
• The old Ship Mat and miniature are removed from the game and are replaced by the new Ship Mat and miniature.

• The old ship’s Bounty is not transferred to the new ship. “New ship, who dis?”

Buy Outﬁts Purchase new Outﬁts or Mods, provided they ﬁt in the Hold.

Rearrange Hold Rearrange any or all undamaged Outﬁts/Mods and cargo in your hold into any legal conﬁguration. Neither Damage Markers nor Outﬁts/ Mods with Damage Markers can be rearranged.

Recharge Energy Recharge their Energy Meter up to its maximum for free.

Repair Damage Pay to remove all normal Damage Markers } from your ship. Repairing a Tier 1$ or Tier 2^ ship costs 1,000%. Repairing a Tier 3& ship costs 2,000%.

Sell Outﬁts/Mods Sell any undamaged Outﬁt/Mod for half of its original cost, rounded up. Tier 1$ Outﬁts sell for 1,000%, tier 2^ for 1,000%, and tier 3& for 2,000%. Damaged Outﬁts cannot be sold; they must ﬁrst be repaired.

Thaw Remove all Ice damage } markers for free.



Wealth

Throw Some Credits Around Captains may purchase 1@ for 5,000%. Captains cannot purchase the ﬁnal Fame Point required for victory.

Status Phase
During the Status Phase, a captain completes the following steps in this order:

1. Freeze Ships with } Ice damage only - place 1 } in every undamaged space that is orthogonally adjacent to existing Ice damage (ice damage does not spread into spaces containing normal damage). If placing this damage completely ﬁlls a ship’s hold - the ship is immediately destroyed.

Titles are claimed and drawn during the Status Phase. Existing Titles are claimed before new Titles are drawn (i.e. a newly drawn Title cannot be claimed in the same Status Phase in which it was drawn).

2. Claim Existing Title The ﬁrst captain to complete a Title’s objective (as listed on the Title Card) may claim it. The captain takes the Title Card and receives the Fame Point(s) and Skill listed on the card. Captains may claim multiple Titles during the Status Phase as long as they meet all necessary objectives. A claimed title is no longer available for other captains to claim.

Skills In addition to granting a captain Fame Points, each Title gives a captain a Skill. Skills are immediately available to the Title holder.

3. Draw New Title The purple spaces on the Fame Point Track are Title spaces. The ﬁrst captain to move their Marker onto or past a Title space draws a Title Card during the Status Phase, reads it aloud, and places it face up in the play area within view of all captains. It is now available for any captain to claim. 

Example The ﬁrst captain to reach 3 Fame Points will draw a Title Card, but the next captain to reach 3 Fame Points will not.

4. Refresh Exhausted Ship Ability Cards and Impulse Token are refreshed by ﬂipping them face up.

5. Arm Markers Arm any spent or Disarmed Markers by moving them onto the Armed Spaces of their Ship Mat.

• It costs one Energy to move each Marker to an Armed Space. If a Marker is not armed, it is placed on a Disarmed Space (no markers can be left on any Outﬁt’s Use spaces).

• Arming Markers while at a Starport is free - captains do not have to spend Energy. Dead Worlds are not planets, so ships on Dead worlds must pay energy to rearm markers.
6. In Demand Cargo (if using the Economy Board) When the Economy Board has one or more empty sections, place 1,000% on each empty section of the Economy Board. No section may ever have more than 1,000% on it. 

7. Select Active Mission Captains look at all their face down mission cards, select at least 1 Active Mission card, then discard down to their Active Mission Limit. (Default Active Mission Limit is 1, M-Comp units may increase this.)

2-Player Rules
The 2-Player Variant has the same rules as a normal game except:

• NPCs count as players for mission target purposes (just like solo play) with the exception of The Kiln. If playing without NPCs, the opposing player is always your mission target.

• ‘Lone Drifter’ Auto-Pilot Ability In 2-Player: Add +2 movement to successful rolls.


Big Shipment
Selling a Big Shipment of Cargo Cubes earns 1 @. A Big Shipment must contain: 
 • at least 2 Cargo Cubes AND 

• all of the Cargo Cubes the current Sell space can buy.

A captain can choose to sell less Cargo Cubes than the location can buy, but they will not receive @ if they do.

Example A captain with 4 Terra Cargo Cubes at Azure’s Sell space can sell all 4 and receive 4,000% and 1 @.
If the captain chose to sell just 1 or 2 or 3 Terra, they would receive 1,000% per cube sold, but would not receive any @.


Credits
Credits (%) are the currency of Xia. Credits are represented by metal Credit coins. Credits come in increments of 1,000% (silver), 2,000% (copper), and 5,000% (blue).

Players can spend Credits to purchase repairs, new Outﬁts, new ships, and even Fame Points.

• Free Trade Players can give their Credits to other players freely. This allows players to bribe other players and forge
alliances. (Bribes and alliances can be broken and are not considered binding.)

Borders
Ô Star (Blocks Line of Sight)

Ú Nebulae
Nebulae are represented by solid, pink lines. Nebulae do not aﬀect Line of Sight.




Star Borders are denoted with solid, red lines. Star Borders represent the edges of Stars. Any ship that moves through a Star Border is immediately destroyed. (Theshipmeltsintheintenseheat.)


Æ Asteroid (Blocks Line of Sight)
Asteroid Fields are represented by jagged-yet-solid orange lines.

Entering Roll a Ï[d20]:

•1-10: The ship takes Damage (}) equal to the roll (an asteroid has collided with the ship). Shield Outﬁts and Abilities may be used immediately after the roll to mitigate this Damage.

• 11-20: No } is taken. (Skillful ﬂying has saved the ship!)

Exiting No roll required, but entering another Asteroid space requires another Ï[d20] roll.

Æ Ice Asteroids (Blocks Line of Sight)
Ice Asteroid spaces have solid white borders and blue ice asteroid artwork inside.

Entering Roll a Ï[d20]:

•1-10: The ship takes Ice Damage (}) equal to the roll. Shield Outﬁts and Abilities may be used immediately after the roll to mitigate this Damage.

• 11-20: No } is taken. (Skillful ﬂying has saved the ship!)

Exiting No roll required, but entering another Ice Asteroid space requires another Ï[d20] roll.

Â Debris Fields (Blocks Line of Sight)
Debris Fields are represented by solid, yellow lines.


Entering Roll a Ï[d20]:

• 1-3: The ship is immediately destroyed. Shield Outfits or other damage reduction abilities do not protect the ship from destruction.

• 4-20: The ship passes through the Debris Field without any consequences.

Exiting No roll required, but entering another Debris Field space requires another Ï[d20] roll.



Entering Roll a Ï[d20]:

1-10:	Subtract an amount of Energy from the ship’s Energy Meter equal to the roll (the ship hit a volatile
electrostatic gas cloud). Shield Outﬁts and Abilities may be used after the roll to mitigate this Energy loss.

If the captain does not have enough Energy on their Energy Meter to satisfy the roll, Armed Markers are disarmed (one
per Energy lost), and moved to the Disarmed section of the Ship Mat. If a ship loses all its energy and has no Armed Markers,
the ship is immediately Stranded - any unspent movement is lost. Impulse Tokens are not aﬀected by Nebulae.

11-20: The ship enters the Nebula with no consequences.

Exiting Once inside a Nebula, captains may stay in, move around, or exit the Nebula without consequences.

Inner Borders have dashed lines and are considered Normal Space.


Example Puddle Jumper crosses a Nebula’s boundary with 4 energy, two Armed Markers, and 4 Movement Points remaining. It rolls a 10 on the Ï[d20] roll. Its Shields roll is only 4, so Puddle Jumper must lose the equivalent of 6 Energy.
Puddle Jumper loses its 4 energy and then moves its two armed markers to Disarmed. It is now Stranded and loses its unspent Movement Points.

< Ø > Planetary Shields (Blocks Line of Sight, Blocks Adjacency)
Planetary Shields are represented by solid, glowing lines in red, green, or blue. The
eﬀects of crossing them are the same, regardless of color.

Entering Roll a Ï[d20]:

•1-10: Take unblockable Damage (}) equal to the roll. The ship loses 1 Movement Point and remains in the space it was in when it attempted the crossing. If the ship still has
Movement Points remaining, it may attempt to cross the shield again after this eﬀect is resolved.

•11-17: The ship successfully crosses the Planetary Shield, but is detected! 1,000% is added to the ship’s Bounty (=)

• 18-20: The ship successfully crosses the Planetary Shield, undetected with no consequences.

Exiting Roll Ï[d20] roll, as above.


20
Cargo Cubes
The core game has 5 diﬀerent types of Cargo Cubes.

An additional cube type, Ember, is added in the expansion.


Spice (S) (Orange)

• Purchased at Kemplar II
• Mined from Outpost 338
• Sold at Neo Damascus for 1,000% per cube


Holo (H) (Pink)

• Purchased at Azure
• Harvested from Burning Horse
• Sold at Kemplar II for 1,000% per cube


Terra (T) (Green)

• Purchased at Doravin V
• Mined from Red Gulch
• Sold at Azure for 1,000% per cube








Plasma (P) (Teal)

• Purchased at Neo Damascus
• Harvested from Lower Stratus
• Sold at Lunari for 1,000% per cube


Cyber (C) (Purple)

• Purchased at Lunari
• Salvaged from Pelmont and Kreller IV
• Sold at Doravin V for 1,000% per cube


Ember (White) 

• Cannot be Purchased at any planet

• Quarried at Blench and The Grinder
• Sold at The Kiln for 2,000% per cube

Economy Board
Supply Buy actions are limited to the cubes available on the Economy Board. If a cube type’s space is empty, it cannot be purchased - it must be obtained by other means until more of its type are Produced.

Consume Sell actions cause each cube sold to be consumed by the purchasing planet - they are not placed on the Economy Board, but are placed in the general supply.

Produce Each time a planet consumes a cargo cube, it produces a new cube of the type the planet generates, taking it from supply and placing it on the Economy Board. 

Each section on the Economy Board may hold a maximum of 6 cubes of that type. While a resource section is full, Sell actions do not cause cubes of that type to be produced.

Example While 4 Plasma Cubes are on the Economy Board, a captain Sells 3 Spice on Neo Damascus. The 3 Spice are consumed and returned to the general supply (not the Economy Board). Neo Damascus then would produce 3 cubes of its type (Plasma); but the ﬁrst 2 placed on the Economy Board’s Plasma section ﬁll it up to its maximum of 6 cubes.The third Plasma cube is not produced and is left in supply.




Event Cards and Event Fame Point Track
If using Event Cards, replace the old Fame Point Track with the new Fame Point Track that has pink Event spaces.

During the Status Phase, the ﬁrst captain to reach or pass an Event space on the Fame Point Track draws an Event Card, reads it aloud, and resolves any eﬀects.

Rounds Many Events last for a limited number of “rounds,” which must be tracked. In this case, the card is placed to the right of the First Player and any ‘round’ rules on the card activate before the First Player’s turn.

Event cards have two sections:

• While This Card Is in Play This section shows the rules for when this card is in play - these rules often override normal rules.

• This Card Leaves Play When This section deﬁnes how this card will leave play (e.g. a set number of rounds, or when a certain action is taken).

Event Tokens There are 8 Event Tokens with pink “EV” printed on them - these can be placed on the game board as a reminder that an event is taking place (for example on Tigris Gate during “Re-Tethered”).
21


In Demand If any resource section of the Economy Board is empty (contains no cubes) during a Status Phase, that resource type is now In Demand. Place 1,000% in the empty resource section. The next Sell action that causes the In Demand resource to be produced earns that captain the 1,000% bonus. The in Demand bonus cannot be higher than 1,000%, no matter how long a resource section has been empty.

Squander When selling cubes to Loath no new cubes are ever produced on the Economy Board.

Kei Cubes traded at Kei are placed on the Economy Board. Cubes received in exchange are taken from the Economy Board (if no cubes or not enough are available, the trade cannot be made). If a trade places cubes that are in Demand, the captain also gains the 1,000% reward. 

A trade may not receive cube types that were placed on the Economy Board by the same captain in the same turn. 

Example a captain who placed Cyber onto the Economy Board could not trade and receive any Cyber during the same turn.
Exploration Tokens
Exploration Spaces represent areas of interest in a Sector.


Missions
Each Mission Card has the following features:




Placing When a newly drawn Sector Tile has an Exploration Space, a random Exploration Token is taken from the pile
(without revealing its face vale) and placed face down on the Exploration Space.
Exploring The ﬁrst captain to move their ship onto the Exploration Space immediately resolves the token. They ﬂip it face up, receive the revealed reward, and place the Exploration Token on their Ship Mat.


1.  Mission Type
 2.  Story Text

3.  Objectives - diﬀerent for each Mission Type
 4.  Payment - determined by diﬀerent factors

5.  Delivery - the Sector Tile containing the Mission Point on which the captain must be located to complete the Mission.




Whenever a captain has 2 Exploration Tokens face up on their ship mat, after resolving the one just collected, they discard both tokens (remove from the game) and gain either 1@ OR 2,000%.

Core Exploration Tokens (21)

Credits (7) The captain immediately receives 1,000%


Fame (7) The captain immediately receives 1 Fame Point (@).


X (7) The captain receives nothing.

Once a token has been claimed by a captain, remove it from the game.


Embers Exploration Tokens (30)

If using the Embers expansion tokens, remove the entire set of core Exploration Tokens, replacing them with the new Exploration Tokens.

Cargo Cube (2 each of Holo, Spice, Terra, Plasma, Cyber) Take a matching Cargo Cube from the supply and place it in the ship’s hold - if there is no available space in the hold for one or more cubes, the cubes are Jettisoned.


Energy (5) Immediately reﬁll the ship's Energy Meter to maximum. This does not arm markers (i.e. this would give a Stranded captain energy, but they would need to wait until the Status Phase to re-arm markers).


Ice Damage (5) Immediately take 1 ice damage (blockable with a shield).


Movement (5) Immediately gain up to +5 Movement Points.


Captain In Need (5) Place the Exploration token on the captain’s ship mat, then draw the top mission card. Read the Deliver To mission point #; (ignoring everything else on the card). To complete Captain in Need, ﬂy to the Deliver To #. On completion, earn 1@ and 1,000%. Captain in Need takes up an Active Mission slot; (an existing Active Mission may be discarded to accept this mission). If the mission is declined, discard the mission card.

Some missions do not have a Deliver To mission point. For Captain in Need, draw and discard missions until a Deliver To mission is drawn.

Discard Pile If the Mission Card Deck runs out, shuﬄe the Mission Card Discard Pile and create a new Mission Card Deck.

Shortest Flyable Distance If a mission requires calculating this distance, start from the Sector Tile containing the “Pick up” Mission Point and count the fewest number of ﬂyable tiles a ship needs to move into to reach the tile containing the “Deliver” Mission Point. A captain must count the most direct route that it is possible to ﬂy. Do not count unexplored space or Star Sectors as ﬂyable tiles. Gate “special movement” is never used when calculating shortest ﬂyable distance.

Example If the “Pick up” Sector is adjacent to the “Deliver” Sector, the shortest ﬂyable distance is 1 Sector.

(Note: Mission cargo / passengers are symbolic and do not have a physical representation or take up Hold spaces: Goods, Contraband, Passengers, etc. For example, nothing is actually stolen on a Thief Mission.)

NPCs

NPC Turns

During Setup, the NPC Cards are shuﬄed and dealt to the ﬁrst three captains. A captain takes a turn for the NPC they control directly after their turn. NPC turns do not have phases like captain turns. To take an NPC turn, the captain reads the NPC card from top to bottom, following the directions. A round of Captain and NPC turns in a 4 captain game will look something like this:


1. Captain 1’s turn.
	6. Captain 3 would take a turn for 2. Captain 1 takes a turn for the	skipped becausetthe Merchant 5E43...nCCCfoaaarcpppetttaaar.iii

NPCs in Combat

Defense Attacked NPCs automatically defend using the defense speciﬁed on their NPC Card. NPCs also roll shield defense vs relevant board eﬀects. 

Damage If damaged, Damage Markers (}) are placed on the NPC’s Card. When the number of } on the card equals or exceeds the NPC’s ‘To Kill’ number, the NPC is destroyed.

Destroyed NPCs are immediately removed from the game board. The captain who destroyed the NPC takes any Credits and Fame Points speciﬁed in the green “On Kill” section of the NPC Card. 

• NPCs Respawn on the turn after their destruction, respawning at a random, unoccupied spawn point as if they’d just entered the game.

• If one NPC destroys another NPC, the Credits on the destroyed NPC’s Card are taken and placed on the attacking NPC’s Card. (Example The Enforcer destroys the Scoundrel. Any Credits on the Scoundrel’s NPC Card are taken and placed on the Enforcer’s NPC Card.)

• Orbit When a ship docks with The Kiln, immediately roll the £[d6] and move the Kiln along its path that number of spaces. If the Kiln would end movement in an occupied space, reduce its move so it ends movement in an unoccupied space.

• Inside Ships outside of The Kiln cannot interact with ships inside The Kiln. Movement within The Kiln costs 1 Movement Point per space. While inside the Kiln, ships may:

Sift Relics While docked with the station during the Action Phase with a Relic Token in their hold, a captain may Sift Relics. The Relic Token is removed from their hold and revealed, at which point the captain picks which reward to receive, either 1@ or some ﬁnancial gain.

Sell Ember The white Cargo Cube, Ember, can be sold at The Kiln’s Sell space for 2,000% per cube. Selling a Big Shipment of Ember is also worth 1@.

• Exiting Ships may exit The Kiln from any space inside the station by spending 1 Movement Point and moving to any space adjacent to The Kiln.

Starport Phase The Kiln counts as a Starport for the purposes of the Starport Phase.

The Kiln cannot be aﬀected, attacked, or damaged by other ships. In the unlikely event that The Kiln is destroyed (e.g. if struck by the comet Rikishi - an Event Card), all ships currently docked are destroyed as well. The Kiln then respawns on the special rules space of Nyr at the start of the next turn.
Outfits and Mods Outfits
Attributes
Name / Type (e.g. Saker V, type Blaster).

Price (e.g. 2,000% for this Blaster).

Die The die rolled to resolve the Outﬁt’s actions.

Use Spaces Where Armed Markers are placed when using
the Outﬁt. Use Spaces limit how many times the Outﬁt may	Use
be used in a turn (e.g. This Blaster, with 2 Use Spaces, may	Spaces be used twice in one turn).

Sections Outﬁts are divided into sections by white dashed lines. Each Section takes up one Hold space, and may hold
one Damage Marker. (e.g. A Saker V takes up 4 Hold spaces and can hold up to 4 Damage Markers.)
Placement
Each Section of an Outfit takes up one space in the Hold. All of an outﬁt’s sections must ﬁt within the ship’s Hold. Outﬁts may not overlap each other. 

Outﬁts that do not ﬁt in the Hold may not be taken aboard ship. Outﬁts may not be placed on Hold spaces that have damage markers.

Exceptions:

• Armor Plating / Cargo Pods have 1 section in the Hold and 3 outside of it.

• Shield Piercer Mods are placed over a Use Space on a Blaster/Missile Outﬁt.
 • Enviro-Shld Mods are placed over a Use Space on a Shield Outﬁt.

Tier I ship Vagabond, loaded for bear…


Using
To Activate an Outﬁt, a captain moves a Marker from an Armed Space on the Ship Mat to an available Use Space on the Outﬁt being activated. The captain then rolls the corresponding die for that Outﬁt. The Action is then completed by resolving the die roll.

Available Use Space A Use Space without Markers or Damage on it. If an Outﬁt does not have any available Use Spaces, then it cannot be used.
Captains can activate their ship’s Outﬁts in any order. A captain may use any, all, or none of their Outﬁts during the Action Phase of their turn.



Damage
Damage Markers can be placed on any Section of an Outﬁt. If placed on a Section that contains a Marker, the Marker is moved to a space on the Ship Mat’s Disarmed area.

• Use Spaces that have Damage cannot be used. 

• Each Damage Marker on an Outﬁt reduces its rolls by 1 (rolls cannot be reduced below 1).

• A Damaged Mod stops functioning and cannot be used.

• Damage, once placed may not be shifted or relocated, it must be repaired.
 • Damaged Outﬁts/Mods may not be sold.

• Damaged Outﬁts/Mods may not be Rearranged in the ship’s hold.

• Outﬁts/Mods may not be placed on spaces with damage markers.




This M-22 Engine has 1 Damage marker. When activated, it rolls d6 and subtracts 1.



This Targe Shield has both Use Spaces covered with Damage Markers. It cannot be activated until at least 1 Use space is uncovered.

Engines
Fire Main Engine


Shields
Shields Up



On activation, roll the die indicated and - after adjustments -receive that amount of Movement Points.

Captains do not have to use all of the rolled movement, but any unused movement is discarded. (See Movement pg. 9.)
This action cannot be used to ram another ship. Attack - Ram

Range: 1, requires Line of Sight.

Ramming requires being adjacent to the target and then taking an Attack - Ram action (a ship may not ram as part of other movement).

On activation, roll the die indicated to determine damage to both Attacker and Target ship. Damage to Attacker is unblockable. Targeted ship may reduce damage with Shields or abilities.


On activation, roll the die indicated and - after adjustments -reduce incoming damage by the result. Incoming damage can be reduced to zero. (See Combat pg. 13.)
Combat Re-Arm Immediately after defending from an Attack action, Markers spent on Shields for that Attack Action can be re-armed at a cost of 1 Energy per Marker.

Shields Can Reduce: • Blaster Damage • Missile Damage
• Ramming Damage (for a Targeted/Rammed ship only) • Asteroid Field Damage (Borders or Mining)

• Nebulae Energy Loss (Borders or Harvesting)




Blasters
Attack - Blasters


• Ice Asteroid Ice Damage (Borders or Quarrying)

Dead World Ice Damage (Excavate)



Range: 1, requires Line of Sight.

On activation, roll the die indicated and - after adjustments -inﬂict that amount of Damage to the target.

Targeted ship may reduce damage with Shields or abilities.



Missiles
Attack - Missiles

Range: 2-6, requires Line of Sight.

On activation, roll the die indicated and - after adjustments - inﬂict that amount of Damage to the target.

Targeted ship may reduce damage with Shields or abilities.

Captains cannot use Missiles to attack adjacent ships; the targeted ship must be at least 2 spaces away.


Shields Oﬀer No Protection Against • Planetary Shield Damage
• Ramming Damage (to the Attacker/Ramming ship) • Debris Fields
• Stars
• Any Damage designated as Unblockable


Armor Plating / Cargo Pod
Only one space of these outﬁts actually sit inside the cargo hold - the green Connecting Section (with the white arrow on it) – the rest of the outﬁt sits outside the hold, adding additional spaces to a captain's ship. 

No section of these outﬁts can overlap with any other outﬁt on a ship.


Armor Plating
This outﬁt increases the amount of damage a ship can absorb before it is destroyed by 3.

Each Section on the armor plating outﬁt can hold 1 damage (and only damage). Nothing else can be
placed on Armor Plating outﬁts. Either an Armor Plating Section is empty, or it contains a single damage marker (} or }).

Ice damage } will only spread via the green Connecting Section to or from the Armor Plating.
27
Cargo Pod
This outﬁt increases the amount of cargo a ship can carry by 3 spaces.

Each Section on the Cargo Pod outﬁt can hold Cargo Cubes or Relics. 

Relic Tokens must be stored entirely inside the cargo pod (a Relic cannot have half in the hold half in the pod).



A Piercer may be placed anywhere in a ship’s hold, but does not function unless is is placed over a Use Space on the correct type of Outﬁt.


Example An attack with a d6 blaster with a Piercer Mod vs an opponent defending with 1d8 shield. The blaster roll is a 4. The shield roll is a 3, which is reduced by the Piercer to 0 (it cannot go below 0). The result is 4 combat damage.




The green Connecting Section is the only Section of the Pod that can contain a single damage marker (} or }). If a Cargo
Pod’s Connecting Section is damaged, all Sections within the cargo pod are also treated as damaged - any cargo there is Jettisoned and no cargo cubes/Relics can be placed anywhere in the Pod until the damage is repaired.

Ice damage } cannot spread into a Cargo Pod beyond the green Connecting Section.









Placing a single damage marker on this Cargo Pod’s Connecting Section causes it to Jettison its Cargo Cubes and Relic (which destroys the Relic). No part of the Pod can be used until this damage is repaired.

Mods (Modifications)

Mods are special 1x1 sized outﬁts that modify other abilities of their ship. 

Just like other Outﬁts, Mods can be rearranged, sold and transferred to a new ship. If a Mod takes damage, it stops functioning and cannot be used, moved, or sold until that damage is repaired. Mods cannot be placed on spaces with damage markers.


Piercer (Shield Piercer)
When Placed over a Use Space on a Blaster/Missile Outﬁt, this space continues to be a Use Space for that Outﬁt, but also gains the following:

Attack With Blasters or Missiles + Piercer

On activation, roll the die indicated on the outﬁt (Blaster or Missile). Shields rolled against the resulting damage are reduced by -4. This ability cannot reduce a Shield’s defensive value below 0.


Enviro-Shld (Environmental Shield)
Placed over a Use Space on a Shield Outﬁt. This space continues to be a Use Space for that Shield Outﬁt, but also gains the following:

On activation of a Shield with an Enviro-Shld Mod, the Shield Outﬁt automatically rolls its maximum value vs. non-combat damage or energy
loss (Mine, Harvest, Quarry, Nebula borders etc.) Enviro-Shlds do not aﬀect shield rolls vs combat damage.
An Enviro-Shld may be placed anywhere in a ship’s hold, but does not function unless is is placed over a Use Space on a Shield Outﬁt.

Example A Mining action rolls an 8, so the ship is about to take 8 non-
combat Damage. The captain activates a d6 shield with an Enviro-Shld Mod.
The shield automatically rolls a 6, resulting in only 2 damage.


GTS (Gravitational Thrust Stabilizers)
Placed in the cargo hold. Each GTS orthogonally adjacent to an Engine Outﬁt increases that Engine’s rolls by +2 to all rolls with this outﬁt. However, the outﬁt roll may never exceed the maximum die roll for that outﬁt.


Example A Tier 1 Engine with 1 damage marker on it and a GTS adjacent to it activates and rolls a 5. The result is reduced by 1 for the damage and then increased by 2 for the GTS Mod, resulting in 6 Movement Points.

M-Comp (Mission Computer) Placed in the cargo hold.

All ships have an Active Mission Limit of one, but for every undamaged M-Comp in a ship’s hold this limit is increased by +2. If a ship’s M-Comp is damaged, it no longer increases the Active Mission Limit and the ship
must discard active missions down to its new Active Mission Limit.


Example A captain Draws 3 Missions while having 1 undamaged M-Comp in their hold. When choosing to keep missions (in the Status Phase), they will be able to keep up to 3 missions (The normal limit of one + 2 for the M-Comp).


28
Relic Tokens
Relic Tokens can be Excavated from Dead Worlds.
Excavate While a ship is on the Excavate
space of a Dead World and has 2 or more available cargo spaces, its captain can roll Ï [d20] if there are Relic Tokens present.

Relic Tokens take up 2 cargo spaces in a ship's hold. Relics may be Jettisoned. if a space holding a Relic Token is damaged, that
token is Jettisoned automatically. Jettisoned Relics are immediately destroyed (removed from the game).

Sift While docked with The Kiln, as a Standard Action, a captain may Sift any Relic Tokens in their hold. Sifting removes a Relic from the ship’s hold, ﬂips it face up, and the captain must choose to receive 1@ OR the rewards shown. Any rewards that will not ﬁt in the Ship’s hold (cubes/mods) are ignored. Sifted Relic Tokens are removed from the game.

Sifted Relic Tokens are worth: 
 •  1@ OR 3,000%
•  1@ OR 2,000% + 2 Speciﬁed Cubes
 •  1@ OR 2,000% + Speciﬁed Mod

Relic Tokens on a Sector occupy the spaces they are in. Ships may freely pass through Relic Tokens on a sector, but may not end their movement there.

Sectors
1
The game board is made up of Sector Tiles.

1. Name / Type Each Sector Tile has a
unique name. An icon (left of name) and
sub-text (below name) denote the	6
Sector’s type.

2. Mission Point This space is used to	4
Draw and Complete Missions. (See Missions pg. 12.)
3. Spawn Point This space is used to
Spawn and Respawn ships.
	5
4. Exploration Space Exploration Tokens are placed on this space.

2
5. Symbols Each side of the Sector Tile has a Symbol. When a captain draws a new Sector Tile,
3
the Symbols are used to align the new tile with the tile on which the captain’s ship is currently located.

After the Sector Tile is placed, the Symbols may be ignored. This will often result in Symbols not lining up with all surrounding tiles; this is ﬁne.


6. Special Spaces Some Sectors have special spaces for Cargo Cubes: Buy, Sell, Mine, Salvage, and Harvest spaces. In addition, some Sectors have spaces that detail special rules for that Sector or space. These special spaces are treated as Normal Space for Movement and Line of Sight.

Borders Each Sector Tile is made up of 19 hexagonal spaces. These hex spaces are divided by diﬀerent kinds of Borders, each with their own set of rules (See Borders pg. 10.)
Calculating Distance Certain rules or cards require captains to calculate distance in Sectors rather than spaces. These are not interchangeable units of distance. (e.g. A ship could be one space away, but in a diﬀerent Sector.)

Ship Ability Cards
Each ship has a unique Ship Ability Card.

Use Each Ship Ability Card speciﬁes how the Ability is used. To use the Ability, the captain spends the Energy speciﬁed on the Ship Ability Card and then follows the directions on that Card. Most require a Ï[d20] roll.

Exhaust After an Ability has been used, the card is ﬂipped face down. It is Exhausted and cannot be used again until it is Refreshed. Some Abilities are Exhausted before their eﬀects take place.
Example A captain uses the Auto-Pilot Ability as an Action, and rolls the Ï[d20]. The card is now
Exhausted. The eﬀect, moving spaces after other captain’s turns, is applied later.
Exception Ship abilities from the Missions and Powers expansion are always active and are never placed face down.
New Ship When a captain purchases a new ship, they retain the Ship Ability Cards from all previously owned ships.
Example When a captain reaches a Tier 3 ship, their ship will have 3 Ship Ability Cards, one gained at each Tier.
Refresh During the Status Phase of a captain’s turn, all their Ship Ability Cards are Refreshed. Flip them face up to indicate they are ready for use again. (See Status Phase pg. 18.)
Starports
Ships that end their Action Phase at a Starport can take a Starport Phase.
 Starports exist at:

• a Planet (any space inside a Planetary Shield); or
 The Kiln (any space inside the Kiln)

Dead Worlds have no Planetary Shields, do not count as Planets, and do not have Starports.

29
Action Phase

During their Action Phase, captains take Actions. To take an Action, the captain:
 • Declares the Action they are taking;

• Spends required Energy/Armed Markers and Rolls any associated dice
 • Resolves the Action’s eﬀects

Minor Actions (M) may be taken during movement without ending movement.

Example A captain uses an Engine Outﬁt and rolls a 5. They may move 3 spaces, take a Blind Jump (M), move 1 space, collect an Exploration Token (M), and move one ﬁnal space.

All other Standard Actions end movement (unspent movement points are lost).

Example A captain uses an Engine Outﬁt and rolls a 5. They move 1 space, and then take a Scan Sector Action, which ends their movement, preventing them from moving the ﬁnal four spaces.

Luck Whenever a captain rolls a natural 20 for any of their Ï[d20] rolls, they receive 1@. Maximum once per turn.

Actions
Movement (See Movement pg. 8.)

Fire Main Engine Spend Armed Markers on Engine Outﬁts to move.
Impulse Exhaust an Impulse Token to move spaces equal to the ship’s Impulse value without spending energy.

Blind Jump (M) When adjacent to an unexplored edge with unspent movement: declare a destination hex, draw a new Sector, place it, and move into the destination hex, resolving any eﬀects.

Resolve Border/Path Eﬀect (M) When a ship crosses a Border, the eﬀects are resolved immediately and then the rest of its movement is resolved. When a ship enters a Gravity Path or Comet Path, the path’s eﬀects are resolved immediately. Resolving these eﬀects can sometimes end movement but crossing borders/entering paths do not intrinsically end movement.

Use Gate (M) A ship on a Gate may spend 1 Movement point to travel through the Gate.

Exploring (See Exploring pg. 9.)
Scan Sector When adjacent to an unexplored edge, pay 1 energy to draw and place a new Sector Tile.

Collect Exploration Token (M) from Exploration Spaces. Tokens can provide @ or other rewards

Rescue A captain with at least 3 energy gives 2 Energy to an adjacent captain’s ship who has no Energy or Armed Markers. Earn 1@.


30

Missions (See Missions pg. 12.)

Draw (M) When on a Mission Point, draw three Mission Cards (placing them face down until the Status phase).

Reveal Objective Reveal an Active Mission Card and attempt its objectives.

Deliver Turn in a completed Active Mission for payment at the ﬁnal Mission Point shown on the card. Earn 1@.

Jettison (M) Discard an Active Mission Card. This may be done at any time.
 Attack Spend Armed Markers to attack using Outﬁts. (See Combat pg. 13.)

• Blasters (range 1)

• Missiles (range 2-6)

• Engines (via Ramming, range 1)

Selling Big Shipments earns 1@. A Big Shipment contains a minimum of 2 Cargo Cubes and all of the cubes in the ship’s hold that a location can buy.


Collect (M) Cargo Cubes that are on a board space can be collected by a ship located in the same space as the Cargo Cube.

Jettison (M) Transfer any cargo cubes from the ship’s hold into the hex the ship occupies. Jettisoned Relics are destroyed (removed from the game).

Mine Cargo Cubes from the Mining Space in an Æ Asteroid sector.
 Harvest Cargo Cubes from the Harvest Space in a Ú Nebula sector.
