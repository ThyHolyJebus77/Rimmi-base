## Factions/Civilizations
- Players interact with four major factions (Emperor, Spacing Guild, Bene Gesserit, and Fremen) to gain influence and benefits.
- Players choose unique leader cards that provide special abilities, but these don't significantly alter core gameplay.

# Additional Info

## SETUP

Place the game board in your play area, then place the Mentat
on its side in the mentat space, and the 4 alliance tokens on the
marked areas of the faction’s influence tracks (Emperor, Spacing
Guild, Bene Gesserit, and Fremen).

Separate the conflict cards by their backs (I, II, and III) and
shuffle each deck. Place the 4 conflict III cards facedown in the
marked area of the board, deal 5 conflict II cards facedown on top
of them, then deal one conflict I card facedown on top of them.
This final 10 card deck is the conflict deck. Return the unused
conflict cards to the box without looking at them.

Shuffle the intrigue deck and place it facedown next to the board.
Shuffle the Imperium deck and place it facedown next to the
board. From it, deal 5 cards face up to form an Imperium row.

Next to this, place the reserve cards in 3 stacks: one for Arrakis
Liaison, one for The Spice Must Flow, and one for Foldspace.

Each player takes a leader and places it in front of them (choose
or select at random). Leaders with more icons after their names
are more strategically complex.

Each player takes a 10 card starting deck, shuffles it, and places
it facedown in their supply to the left of their leader. Each player
takes 1 water and places it in their supply.

Create a bank next to the board containing the solari, spice, and
remaining water tokens. These are not limited; if you run out and
need more, use any convenient substitute.

Each player chooses a color and takes all of its components. Place
2 of your agents on your leader, and your third (swordmaster) next
to the board. Place one of your 2 discs on the score track. In a 4
player game, place it on the 1 space. Otherwise, place it on the
0 space. Place your combat marker (sword side faceup) on the 0
space of the combat track.

Place 4 cubes, one each, on the bottom spaces of the influence
tracks of the 4 factions. The other 12 cubes are your troops: place
3 in one of the 4 circular garrisons on the board (each player
taking the one closest to them).

Place remaining components in your supply, in view of all players.
Determine a first player randomly to take the first player marker.

## ROUND STRUCTURE

The game is played in a sequence of rounds. Each round consists
of 5 phases, played in order.

## 1. ROUND START

Reveal a new conflict card from the top of the conflict deck
and place it faceup in the space next to the deck (on top of any
conflict cards from previous rounds).

Each player then draws 5 cards from their own deck, forming their
hand for the round.

## 2. PLAYER TURNS

Starting with the player with the first player marker and going
clockwise, players take 1 turn at a time.

On your turn, take either an agent turn or a reveal turn. Generally,
you take agent turns until you run out of agents to place, then you
take a reveal turn. Agent turns are optional. If you wish, you can
take a reveal turn while you still have agents instead of taking an
agent turn.

```
Once you’ve taken a reveal turn, your turns are skipped for the
rest of the phase, while other players finish taking their turns.
Once all players have taken a reveal turn, this phase ends.
```
```
You may play any plot intrigue cards you have during this phase,
at any point during one of your own agent or reveal turns.
```
## AGENT TURN

```
In an agent turn, you play 1 card from your hand faceup in front of
you, using it to send an agent from your leader to an unoccupied
space on the board. This space must have an icon in its upper left
corner matching one of the agent icons on the card.
```
```
You must choose only 1 agent icon on your card; one card can’t
send multiple agents.
```
```
You can’t send an agent to a board space that already has one.
```
```
The board space you choose may have a cost or requirements. If
you can’t pay the cost immediately (before resolving any effects of
the space or the card you played), you can’t send your agent there.
```
```
Sietch Tabr has a unique requirement: to send an agent there,
you must have 2 or more influence with the Fremen.
The agent box (top box) of the card you played may provide an
effect when you play it on an agent turn (ignore the reveal box of
the card during agent turns).
```
```
If a card does not have any agent icons on it, you may not play it
during an agent turn; it may only be revealed during a reveal turn.
```
```
When you play a card and send an agent to a board space,
you gain the effects of the board space as well as the effects
contained in the card's agent box. If the board space belongs to
one of the factions, you also move your cube 1 space up on its
influence track. You may carry out all these effects in any order.
Arrows ( ) indicate that there is a cost (left of the arrow, or
above it) you must pay to get the effect (right of the arrow, or
below it). You are never forced to pay such a cost, but if don’t, you
do not gain the effect.
```
#### DEPLOYING TROOPS TO THE CONFLICT

```
Whenever the cube icon appears on a card or board space, you
recruit 1 troop. Take a troop from your supply and place it in your
garrison on the board. If you run out of troops in your supply, you
can’t recruit more until some return.
```
```
When you send an agent to a combat space (a desert illustration
and crossed swords), you may deploy units to the conflict area of
the board. You may deploy any or all units recruited during your
current turn (from both the board space and the card you played),
plus up to 2 more units from your garrison. Any units you recruit
but choose not to deploy to the conflict are placed in your garrison
as usual.
```
#### CONTROL BONUSES

```
Some conflict cards reward you with control over one of 3 spaces:
Arrakeen, Carthag, or Imperial Basin (based on the card’s title).
If you win such a conflict, take a control marker from your supply
and place it on the flag below the appropriate board space.
While your control marker is on one of these spaces, you receive
the bonus shown whenever any player (yourself included) sends
an agent there. The bonus is 1 solari for Arrakeen or Carthag, and
1 spice for Imperial Basin.
```
```
When a conflict card is revealed for a space that you already
control, you receive a defensive bonus: you may deploy 1 troop
from your supply to the conflict.
```
#### HARVESTING SPICE

```
There are 3 board spaces with a Maker icon, where you may
harvest spice: The Great Flat, Hagga Basin, and Imperial Basin.
When you send an agent to one, you gain the base value of spice
shown, plus any bonus spice that has accumulated there.
```
## REVEAL TURN

```
When you have no more agents for agent turns (or you choose not
to use any agents you have remaining), you take a reveal turn by
performing these steps in order:
```
#### 1. REVEAL CARDS

```
Reveal all cards remaining in your hand, placing them faceup
in play in front of you. Keep them separate from other cards you
played previously on agent turns.
```
#### 2. RESOLVE REVEAL EFFECTS

```
You now gain the effects in the reveal boxes (bottom box) of all
the cards you just revealed (but not those of any cards you played
during agent turns earlier in the round).
```
```
You may resolve reveal effects in any order you like. You may also
may use persuasion you’ve gained to acquire new cards for
your deck before, between, or after your reveal effects.
```
```
You may acquire any of the 5 cards in the Imperium row, or Arrakis
Liaison or The Spice Must Flow from the reserve (Foldspace is
acquired at the board space of the same name). The cost to
acquire a card is shown at the top right of that card.
You may acquire as many cards as you like, as long as you have
enough persuasion to spend. You may pool persuasion from
multiple sources (cards and board spaces) to acquire 1 card,
and may split persuasion from a single source to pay for different
cards. Any persuasion you don’t use during your reveal turn is lost.
```
```
When you acquire a card, place it in your discard pile (faceup to
the right of your leader).
```
```
Whenever the Imperium row does not have 5 cards, replace
missing cards from the top of the Imperium deck. Therefore, after
you acquire a card, you may then acquire the card that replaces it
(if you have enough persuasion).
```
#### 3. SET STRENGTH

```
Total your strength for the combat this round. Each troop you
have in the conflict is worth 2 strength (troops in your garrison or
supply contribute nothing). Each sword you revealed during your
reveal turn is worth 1 strength.
```
```
You must have at least 1 troop in the conflict to have any strength.
If your last troop is removed, your strength is 0, and can’t be
increased by any means, including swords on cards you revealed.
```
```
When you’ve totaled your strength, announce it to your opponents
and move your combat marker to the corresponding space on the
combat track. If your strength is over 20, flip the combat marker
to the +20 side and start again from the beginning of the track.
```
#### 4. CLEAN UP

```
Remove all the cards from in front of you (from your agent and
reveal turns) and put them in your discard pile.
```
## 3. COMBAT

#### 1. COMBAT INTRIGUE CARDS

```
Starting with the player who has the first player marker and going
clockwise, each player with at least 1 troop in the conflict may
play any number of combat intrigue cards, or may pass.
```
```
You are not required to pass just because you passed earlier
in the combat phase. Once all players involved in combat pass
consecutively, you then resolve the combat.
If a card changes the number of troops a player has in the conflict
(or otherwise alters their strength), they adjust their combat
marker accordingly on the combat track (if you have no troops in
the conflict, your strength is 0).
```
```
If an intrigue cards says you do something “when you win a
conflict,” you must wait until you’ve won the conflict before
playing the card.
```
#### 2. RESOLVE COMBAT

```
Rewards from the conflict card are given to players based on their
strength, as shown on the combat track.
The player with the highest strength wins the conflict and gains
the top reward on the conflict card. The player with the second
highest strength gains the second reward. In a 4 player game
(only), the player with the third highest strength receives the third
reward. A player with 0 strength does not receive any reward.
```
```
Once all rewards have been given, each player takes their troops
from the conflict and puts them in their supply (not their garrison).
Reset all combat markers to 0 on the combat track.
On a tie for first place, no one wins. The tied players each receive
the second reward. In a 4 player game, if 2 players tie for first
place, the other 2 players still compete for the third reward.
```
```
When players tie for second place, they each receive the third
reward. Players tying for third place receive nothing.
```
## 4. MAKERS

```
Check each of the 3 board spaces with a Maker icon: The Great
Flat, Hagga Basin, and Imperial Basin. If the space does not have
an agent, place 1 spice from the bank on that space (in the spot
designated for bonus spice). This is added to any bonus spice that
may already be there from previous rounds.
```
## 5. RECALL

```
If any player is at 10 or more victory point (VPs) on the score
track, or if the conflict deck is empty, the endgame is triggered.
If no one has won, prepare the next round:
Return the Mentat to its designated space in the Landsraad
(if it’s not already there). Players recall their agents, returning
them to their leaders.
Finally, pass the first player marker clockwise to the next player,
and begin a new round.
```
## OTHER RULES

#### LEADERS

```
Each Leader has 2 unique abilities: the ability on the left is used
during play as described. The ability on the right (marked by the
signet ring icon, is activated when you play your Signet Ring card
on one of your agent turns.
```
#### DECK BUILDING

```
Whenever you acquire a new Imperium or reserve card, place it
in your discard pile. If at any time you’re unable to draw a card
because your deck is empty, reshuffle your discard pile to form a
new deck, then continue to draw as needed.
```
#### AGENTS

```
You send agents to spaces on the game board, sometimes
gathering resources, sometimes paying resources to advance your
strategy. You can’t send an agent to a board space without first
playing a card that allows it.
```
```
The Mentat is a special freelance agent that you can temporarily
add to your roster of agents for 1 round.
```
#### FACTIONS

```
When you send an agent to a faction’s board space, gain 1
influence with that faction by advancing your cube 1 space on its
influence track. Other game effects can also move your cube up
and down the track.
When you reach 2 influence with a faction, you gain a VP. If you
drop back below 2 influence, you lose that VP.
When you reach 4 influence, gain the bonus on that space of the
track. If you drop back below 4 influence, you do not give back the
bonus (you may earn the same bonus more than once).
```

The first player to reach 4 influence with a faction also earns an
alliance with that faction. They take the alliance token from the
track, put it in their supply and gain the VP shown on the alliance
token. If they are ever passed by an opponent rising to a higher
space on the track, they must give the alliance token to that
opponent; they lose that VP and the opponent gains it.

#### INTRIGUE CARDS

You receive intrigue cards primarily from these board spaces:
Carthag, Conspire, and Secrets. They are kept facedown, separate
from your deck, and you may look at them at any time. Reveal
them only when you play them. Once an intrigue card is played
and resolved, place it faceup in a discard pile next to the deck.

Plot: play any time during one of your agent or reveal turns.

Combat: play only during combat.

Endgame: play only at the end of the game.

## ENDGAME

First, you may play and resolve any endgame intrigue cards you
have. Then whoever has the most VPs is the winner. On a tie,
tiebreakers are, in order: amount of spice, solari, water, and
garrisoned troops.

## HOUSE HAGAL

House Hagal cards are used to control automated opponents
(rivals) who compete against you in solo and 2 player games.
These opponents send agents to occupy board spaces and
contest conflicts by recruiting and deploying troops.

Rivals are affected by cards and board spaces that affect
‘opponents/players’ if they have the specified resources.

Agents
During Phase 2: Player Turns, a rival will take agent turns but it
will not take reveal turns.

When a rival takes an agent turn, reveal the top card of the House
Hagal deck; this will send an agent to the revealed board space,
as long as it is unoccupied. If it is occupied, ignore the card and
continue revealing cards until you reveal an unoccupied space.

If the House Hagal deck is ever empty (or if the reshuffle card is
revealed), immediately reshuffle the cards to form a new deck.

When a rival sends an agent to a board space, ignore all normal
costs and effects of that space. Instead, it gets only the effects
indicated on its revealed card:

The rival advances on the
indicated influence track.
It earns no bonuses from an influence track, but it will take
a faction alliance if able.

```
The rival uses the Signet Ring ability on its leader
(solo play only).
The rival recruits 1 troop from its supply for each such
icon. If the revealed card is a combat space, deploy them
to the conflict. Otherwise, put the troops in its garrison.
```
Any time a rival sends an agent to a combat space, it also deploys
up to 2 troops from its garrison (if available) to the conflict. Do
this even if the card itself recruited no troops.

Combat
When Phase 3: Combat begins, each rival that has at least 1 troop
in the conflict gets a combat bonus. In turn order, reveal the top
card of the House Hagal deck. If you reveal the reshuffle card,
reshuffle the deck and reveal again. Ignore everything on the
revealed card except for the sword icons at the bottom.

Advance the opponent’s combat marker on the combat track by
the number of swords revealed. Players may then play combat
intrigue cards before resolving combat.

## 2 PLAYER GAMES

```
House Hagal competes against you and your opponent. It doesn’t
collect resources, build a deck, earn rewards, or score VPs, but it
does use the House Hagal cards as described above (occupying
board spaces with agents, competing in conflicts by recruiting
and deploying troops, and taking faction alliances).
```
#### SETUP

```
Choose a color for House Hagal. Place one of its cubes on each of
the bottom spaces beneath the influence tracks of the 4 factions.
Put the rest of its cubes in its supply. It starts with no troops in
its garrison. Remove from the House Hagal deck the 3 Arrakeen
cards marked 1P in the upper right corner. Shuffle the remaining
cards and place them and House Hagal’s 3 agents near its supply.
```
#### GAMEPLAY

```
After each of the first player’s agent turns, House Hagal acts,
as long as it has an agent remaining in its supply. The number of
turns it takes each round varies since it acts after the first player.
```
```
Because House Hagal can’t collect rewards from a conflict, it can
never claim control of a board space. However, if it wins a conflict
for a board space currently controlled by another player, remove
that player’s control marker.
```
## SOLO GAMES

```
You face off against 2 rivals; if either reaches 10 or more VPs, they
will trigger the end of the game (and they may defeat you).
```
#### SETUP

```
Select a difficulty level: Mercenary Sardaukar Mentat
Novice Veteran Expert
```
```
Your extra starting resources 1 solari – –
1 spice
```
```
5 solari token on Mentat space No Yes Yes

rival swordmasters 5 4 3
```
```
Rival extra starting resources – 1 intrigue 1 intrigue
card card
Kwisatz Haderach (Expert+): You also can’t gain a swordmaster.
```
```
Choose 2 leaders, one for each rival. These rivals will use only the
Signet Ring ability on their leaders, ignoring the ability on the left.
Your opponents can’t play Paul Atreides or Helena Richese.
```
```
For each rival, choose a color. Place one of their cubes on each of
the bottom spaces beneath the influence tracks of the 4 factions.
Put the number of troops in their garrison for your chosen
difficulty, and the rest in their supply. Place 2 of their agents in
their supply, and insert the swordmasters (third agents) for both
rivals into the conflict deck, putting exactly the number of cards
on top of them as indicated for your difficulty.
```
```
Remove from the House Hagal deck all cards marked 2P in the
upper right corner (the Reshuffle card and 3 Arrakeen cards).
Shuffle the remaining cards and place the deck near your rivals.
```
```
If your difficulty calls for it, place a 5 solari token on the Mentat
space: for this game, this board space costs 5 solari instead
of 2. You and your rivals each start with 1 water, plus the extra
resources indicated for your chosen difficulty. The rival on your
left takes the first player marker.
```
#### RIVALS’ TURNS

```
During Phase 2: Player Turns, your rivals each take agent turns
in sequence with you, as long as they have an agent remaining in
their supply.
```
```
When a rival uses harvest spice to send an agent to a board
space, it gains all spice there (base and bonus). Place any
accumulated resources in the rival’s supply.
```
#### COMBAT

```
Rivals gain first and second place rewards from conflicts, even
things they otherwise don’t take from board spaces: they gain
VPs, and influence with factions. They gain solari, spice, water,
and intrigue cards (keep these in the rival’s supply). They win
control of board spaces, placing a control marker on the flag
below it. On future turns, they get the control bonus whenever you
or a rival sends an agent there. They also receive the defensive
bonus of 1 troop if a conflict over that board space is later
revealed. They gain the Mentat, and use it as an agent during the
next round.
```
#### ADDITIONAL RULES

```
Swordmasters: When you reveal the conflict card above the rival
swordmasters, your rivals each immediately receive their third
agents; they will use them in the current round and for the rest of
the game.
Choices: Whenever a rival has a choice about gaining influence,
they choose the faction in which they have the least. On a tie (or
when there is a choice not involving influence), you decide.
Corner the market: For the purposes of this intrigue card, treat
each rival as though they have 2 The Spice Must Flow cards (you’ll
need 3 yourself to get 2 VPs).
Expert troop deployment: When playing at expert difficulty, your
rivals are more selective about deploying troops to a conflict.
When fighting for a conflict I or II card, a rival won’t deploy troops
if it is already leading by 2 or more troops (saving them in its
garrison instead). For a critical conflict III card, a rival will resume
deploying all the troops it can at every opportunity.
```
## SPENDING RESOURCES

```
At any time, when a rival has the following resources, they’ll spend
them to earn a VP.
1 VP = 3 intrigue cards / 3 water / 7 solari / 7 spice.

1 turn at a time. On your turn, take either an agent turn or a
reveal turn (commonly, you take agent turns until you run out
of agents, then you take a reveal turn). Once you’ve taken a
reveal turn, your turns are skipped for the rest of the phase.
Once all players have taken a reveal turn, this phase ends.

You may play any plot intrigue cards at any point during one of
your own agent or reveal turns.

## AGENT TURN

Play 1 card from your hand, using it to send an agent to an
unoccupied space. This space must have an icon in its upper
left corner matching one of the agent icons on the card.Pay
any cost or requirement of the space.

Gain the effects of the board space and the effects in the
card's agent box. If the board space belongs to one of the
factions, move your cube 1 space up on its influence track.

Arrows ( ) indicate there is a cost to pay to get the effect.

#### DEPLOYING TROOPS TO THE CONFLICT

Whenever the cube icon appears on a card or board space,
recruit 1 troop, placing it in your garrison.

When you send an agent to a combat space, you may deploy
any or all units recruited during your current turn, plus up to 2
more from your garrison.

#### CONTROL BONUSES

Some conflict cards reward you with control over Arrakeen,
Carthag, or Imperial Basin. If you win such a conflict, place a
control marker on the flag below the space.

You receive the bonus shown whenever any player (yourself
included) sends an agent there (1 solari for Arrakeen or
Carthag, and 1 spice for Imperial Basin).

When a conflict card is revealed for a space that you already
control, you receive a defensive bonus: you may deploy 1 troop
from your supply to the conflict.

#### HARVESTING SPICE

When you send an agent to a space with a Maker icon (The
Great Flat, Hagga Basin, and Imperial Basin), you gain the base
value of spice shown, plus any bonus spice there.

## REVEAL TURN

#### 1. REVEAL CARDS

Reveal all cards remaining in your hand.

#### 2. RESOLVE REVEAL EFFECTS

Gain the effects in the reveal boxes (bottom box) of all the
cards you just revealed. You may also may use persuasion
you’ve gained to acquire new cards for your deck. You may
acquire any of the 5 cards in the Imperium row, or Arrakis
Liaison or The Spice Must Flow from the reserve.

You may acquire as many cards as you like, as long as you have
enough persuasion to spend. Any persuasion you don’t use
during your reveal turn is lost.

```
When you acquire a card, place it in your discard pile.
```
```
Whenever the Imperium row does not have 5 cards, replace
missing cards from the top of the Imperium deck.
```
#### 3. SET STRENGTH

```
Total your strength. Each troop you have in the conflict is worth
2 strength. Each sword you revealed during your reveal turn is
worth 1 strength. You must have at least 1 troop in the conflict
to have any strength.
```
```
Announce your total strength to your opponents and move
your combat marker to the corresponding space.
```
#### 4. CLEAN UP

```
Remove all the cards from in front of you (from your agent and
reveal turns) and put them in your discard pile.
```
## 3. COMBAT

#### 1. COMBAT INTRIGUE CARDS

```
Starting with the player who has the first player marker and
going clockwise, each player with at least 1 troop in the
conflict may play any number of combat intrigue cards, or
may pass.
You are not required to pass just because you passed earlier
in the combat phase. Once all players involved in combat pass
consecutively, you then resolve the combat.
```
```
If a card changes the number of troops a player has in the
conflict (or otherwise alters their strength), they adjust their
combat marker accordingly on the combat track (if you have
no troops in the conflict, your strength is 0).
```
```
If an intrigue cards says you do something “when you win a
conflict,” you must wait until you’ve won the conflict before
playing the card.
```
#### 2. RESOLVE COMBAT

```
Rewards from the conflict card are given to players based on
their strength, as shown on the combat track.
```
```
The player with the highest strength wins the conflict and gains
the top reward on the conflict card. The player with the second
highest strength gains the second reward. In a 4 player game
(only), the player with the third highest strength receives the
third reward. A player with 0 strength does not receive any
reward.
```
```
Once all rewards have been given, each player takes their
troops from the conflict and puts them in their supply (not their
garrison). Reset all combat markers to 0 on the combat track.
On a tie for first place, no one wins. The tied players each
receive the second reward. In a 4 player game, if 2 players tie
for first, the other 2 players still compete for the third reward.
```
```
When players tie for second place, they each receive the third
reward. Players tying for third place receive nothing.
```
## 4. MAKERS

```

the first player marker clockwise to the next player, and begin
a new round.

```
#### DEPLOYING TROOPS TO THE CONFLICT

```
Whenever the cube icon appears on a card or board space,

## ICON AND TERMS GUIDE ICON AND TERMS GUIDE


## RISE OF IX

## ADDITIONS TO SETUP

Place the CHOAM board overlay on top of the upper right corner
of the game board (covering the original Landsraad and CHOAM
sections).

Place the Ix board next to the game board.

Shuffle the 18 tech tiles facedown, then divide them into 3 stacks
of 6 tiles. Place the stacks on the 3 spaces of the Ix board, then
turn the top tile in each stack faceup.

Add the new conflict cards, intrigue cards, and Imperium cards to
their respective decks before performing their setup as normal.

Add the 6 new leaders. When taking leaders, players may choose
any combination of new or existing leaders.

Each player takes the new components of their color. Place the 2
dreadnoughts with your other starting components. Place the disc
as a freighter on the bottom space of the shipping track.

#### UNITS

This new term means either a troop or a dreadnought. New
cards may refer to a unit generally, or to a troop or dreadnought
specifically. All cards from the base game that refer to troops
don’t affect units, and so can’t affect dreadnoughts.

## TECH TILES

```
The acquire tech icon is the only way to acquire a
tech tile. Each time you trigger one, you may
acquire 1 tech tile from the Ix board. There is no
limit to the number of tech tiles you may have.
```
To acquire a tech tile, choose a faceup tile on top of any of the
3 stacks, pay the cost in spice shown, then put the tile in your
supply (visible to all players). Finally, turn the next tile in the stack
faceup. If a stack is emptied, there will be fewer choices available
for the rest of the game.

There are 2 means of reducing the cost of a tech tile, though the
cost can never be less than 0:

```
Tech discounts: When the acquire tech icon
appears with a -1 or -2 spice icon on the corner,
the cost of that single purchase is reduced by that
amount of spice. You can’t combine the discounts
from more than 1 icon.
```
```
Tech negotiation: Each time you trigger this icon
you may take a troop from your supply and place it
as a negotiator on the Ix board, on the banner to
the left of the tech tiles. If you have no troops in
your supply, nothing happens.
```
Your tech negotiation pays off later, when using the acquire tech
icon. At that time, you may return to your supply any number of
your negotiators from the Ix board.

For each negotiator you return, reduce the cost of the tech
tile you’re buying by 1 spice. You may combine this with a tech
discount.

An ability with this icon is used during one of your
agent turns, and can be used only once per round.
When you use such a tech tile, flip it facedown.
At the start of the next round (during phase 1: round start), return
it to its faceup side to show you can use it again.

## THE SHIPPING TRACK

#### MOVING AND RECALLING FREIGHTERS

```
Each time you trigger the freighter icon, you may move
your freighter in one of 2 ways:
```
1. Advance your freighter 1 space up on the shipping track. You
    can’t choose this if your freighter is already on the top space.
2. Recall your freighter back to the bottom of the shipping track.
    When you do, you collect all the shipping rewards associated
    with your freighter’s current space and each space below it.

#### COLLECTING SHIPPING REWARDS

```
When you recall your freighter, take your rewards in any order.
The rewards for each space on the shipping track are:
```
```
Top: You may acquire tech with a tech discount of 2 spice.
Middle: You recruit 2 troops, and also gain 2 influence with any
one of the 4 factions.
```
```
Bottom: Gain 5 solari and each of your opponents gains 1 solari
or gain 2 spice.
```
## DREADNOUGHTS

```
Each time you trigger the dreadnought icon, you may
commission 1 dreadnought : take it from your supply
and put it in your garrison.
```
```
If you commissioned the dreadnought while sending an agent to a
combat space, you may deploy it to the conflict.
```
```
Each player may have only 2 dreadnoughts commissioned at a
time; if you have none left in your supply, you can’t commission
any more.
```
```
Each dreadnought in a conflict is worth 3 strength. They provide
strength even if you have no troops in a conflict; your strength
does not become 0, your swords still count, and you may play
combat intrigue cards.
```
```
When combat resolves, your dreadnoughts don’t return to your
supply. If you don’t win, return them to your garrison instead.
```
#### CONTROLLING LOCATIONS

```
A dreadnought can control any of the 3 spaces where a control
marker can be placed: Arrakeen, Carthag, or the Imperial Basin.
```
```
When you win a conflict in which you had at least 1 dreadnought,
you must choose one of those spaces where there is not already
a dreadnought. Place your dreadnought on the flag below that
space, covering any control marker that may already be there.
If your second dreadnought was also in the conflict, return it to
your garrison.
```
```
While your dreadnought is at a location, you gain any bonus that
would normally be given for a control marker: 1 solari for Arrakeen
or Carthag, 1 spice for the Imperial Basin, and 1 troop if a conflict
card awards a defensive bonus. Your control lasts until the end of
the next combat phase. At that time, your dreadnought returns to
your garrison (and control of the location returns to the owner of
any control marker your dreadnought may have been covering).
```
## NEW ICONS

#### DISCARD

```
The discard icon means you choose a card from your
hand (not an intrigue card) and put it in your discard pile,
usually to pay a cost to get some other effect.
```
#### UNLOAD

```
The reveal boxes of some new cards are marked
with an unload icon. This indicates 2 additional
ways to gain the effects: when you discard the
card, and when you trash the card.
```
```
Unload reveal boxes also work like all other cards on one of your
reveal turns: if you reveal the card, ignore the unload icon, and
gain its reveal effects normally.
A card with an unload reveal box does not itself provide the option
to discard or trash it. Unless specifically stated, you must use
other means to do so.
```
#### INFILTRATION

```
Some new cards have special agent icons that
show the partial profile of an agent. This indicates
that you may infiltrate an occupied board space:
enemy agents (even multiple ones) don’t block your agent from
being placed on a board space that shares the agent icon.
You can’t use infiltration to send a second agent to a board space
where you already have one; infiltration only works against enemy
agents. Infiltration does not allow you to ignore the effect of the
card The Voice.
If you use the intrigue card Dispatch an Envoy to add icons to a
card that has an infiltration icon, the new icons you add do not
allow you to infiltrate.
```
## SOLO & 2 PLAYER GAMES

#### SETUP

```
Remove the 2 Hall of Oratory cards and the 2 Rally Troops cards
from the House Hagal deck. Shuffle in the new House Hagal cards
(some are excluded, depending on the number of players).
For a solo game, remove the 2 Dreadnought cards marked 2P. For
a 2 player game, remove the 4 cards marked 1P (2 Dreadnought
cards and 2 Tech Negotiation cards).
```
#### NEW HOUSE HAGAL CARDS

```
The new cards send rival agents to board spaces on the Ix board
and CHOAM overlay, giving them the effects shown on the cards.
```
```
Dreadnought: If this card is revealed for a rival that already has
2 dreadnoughts, skip it and reveal another card instead.
Interstellar Shipping: The Interstellar Shipping board space
requires that a player has 2 influence with the Spacing Guild. This
also applies to rivals, so each Interstellar Shipping card provides
an alternative for a rival that doesn’t have enough influence:
either skipping the card to reveal another, or specifying an
alternate space for the rival’s agent.
```
#### THE SHIPPING TRACK

```
When a rival moves its freighter on the shipping track, it always
advances until it reaches the second space (recruit 2 troops and
gain 1 influence), and then it will recall its freighter. It always
chooses dividends (not spice) as its reward for the first space:
gaining 5 solari (in a solo game) while all other players gain 1
solari. Rivals in a solo game gain 1 solari from dividends whenever
another player chooses it (a human or a rival).
```
#### DREADNOUGHTS

```
A rival always prefers to deploy dreadnoughts over troops, and will
deploy a dreadnought to the conflict whenever it can.
Whenever a rival wins a conflict and its dreadnought must
take control of a board space, it always covers an opponent’s
control marker when possible, and will avoid covering one of its
own. When there are still multiple places a rival could send its
dreadnought, it prefers Imperial Basin, then proceeds counter-
clockwise around the board (to Arrakeen, then Carthag).
```
#### SOLO GAME RIVALS

```
Two of the new leaders can be played by a rival in a solo game:
Prince Rhombur Vernius and Viscount Hundro Moritani. You may
freely mix them with existing leaders when selecting your rivals.
```
```
Prince Rhombur Vernius: When this rival activates his Signet
Ring, he will acquire tech if he can. If not, he will use the tech
negotiation icon.
```
```
Viscount Hundro Moritani: When this rival activates his Signet
Ring, he will always spend 1 spice (if he has it) for the freighter
icon. Some new conflicts reward players with troops; a rival in a
solo game does collect these rewards.
```
#### TECH TILES

```
In a 2 player game, your rival ignores tech tiles completely. None
of these tech tiles rules apply.
```
```
In a solo game, rivals can acquire tech tiles, but only those that
are marked with a small House Hagal icon in the lower right
corner. If at any time there are no faceup tech tiles with that mark
on any of the stacks, trash the tile from the largest stack and
reveal a new one (if multiple stacks are tied for the largest, trash
the tile from the topmost stack).
```
```
A rival will hoard spice for tech tiles; they will not spend 7 spice for
a VP unless the current conflict card is a conflict III card.
```
```
When a rival uses an acquire tech icon, it acquires the most
expensive tech tile it can (in the case of a tie, it chooses the tech
tile from the topmost stack).
When a rival sends an agent to tech negotiation, it will acquire
tech with a 1 spice tech discount. If it can’t afford any tech tiles,
but it does have at least 1 troop in its supply, it will instead place a
troop as a negotiator on the planet Ix. The next time the rival has a
chance to acquire tech, it will use that negotiator (and any others
it has on Ix) to reduce the cost of a tech tile if it can.
```
```
When a rival acquires a tech tile, it generally works as normal.
Some tech tiles require specific clarification:
```
```
Detonation Devices: A rival will always gain a VP when it can.
Flagship: Whenever a rival sends an agent to a combat space, if it
has 4 solari (and at least 3 troops in its supply), it will spend that
solari and flip this tile to recruit and deploy 3 troops.
```
```
Holtzman Engine: This tile is worth 1 VP to a rival at endgame. As
with the Corner the Market intrigue card, each rival is considered
to have 2 The Spice Must Flow cards.
```
```
Invasion Ships: A rival flips this tile when needed to avoid its agent
being blocked. It does so without having to pay the discard cost.
```
```
Sonic Snoopers: A rival will draw an intrigue card when acquiring
this, but it will never trash the tech tile.
```
```
Spy Satellites: If a rival has 3 spice on its turn, it will spend that
spice to trash this tile for a VP.
```
```
Training Drones: A rival will flip this during its turn at the first
opportunity each round, including immediately when it acquires
the tile.
Troop Transports: A rival will always deploy to the conflict all
troops it recruits from the shipping track (unless you’re using the
Expert Troop Deployment rule).
```
## EPIC GAME MODE

```
This optional variant is for a longer and more intense multiplayer
game. For an especially epic game, you can also use the Arrakeen
Scouts mode in the companion app.
In an epic game, play to 12 VPs instead of 10. All other changes
are made during the setup:
Do not use any conflict I cards when building the conflict deck.
Instead, use 5 randomly selected conflict II cards on top of 5
conflict III cards. Each player removes 1 copy of Dune, the Desert
Planet from their starting deck and replaces it with 1 copy of
Control the Spice.
```
```
Each player draws an intrigue card (a player using Viscount
Hundro Moritani should wait until all players have drawn their
intrigue card, then use the Intelligence ability).
Each player begins with 5 troops in their garrison (instead of 3).
```

## IMMORTALITY

## ADDITIONS TO SETUP

Shuffe the 30 Imperium cards into the Imperium deck (before
forming the Imperium row).

Place the Bene Tleilax board above the Imperium row and reserve
cards. Place 2 spice from the bank on the fourth space of the
Tleilaxu track.

Each player takes the 2 new discs of their color, then places 1 as a
Tleilaxu token on the leftmost space of the Tleilaxu track and 1 as
a research token on the leftmost space of the research track.

Create a Tleilaxu row above the Imperium row. Place the
Reclaimed Forces card to the left of the Bene Tleilax board.

Shuffle the Tleilaxu deck and place it facedown above the
Imperium deck. From it, deal 2 cards faceup next to the
Reclaimed Forces card.

Place the Research Station overlay on top of the Research Station
space of your original game board.

Each player takes a family atomics token and place it in their
supply.

Each player returns their 2 starting deck copies of Dune, the
Desert Planet to the box, replacing them with 2 copies of
Experimentation from this expansion.

Shuffle the 15 intrigue cards into the intrigue deck.

## THE BENE TLEILAX BOARD

#### THE RESEARCH TRACK

```
Each time you trigger the research icon, advance
your research token 1 space to the right on the
research track.
```
You may have a choice between 2 rightward directions, but you
may never move straight up or down, or to the left.

When you advance to a research space, immediately gain the
bonus shown there:

```
Genetic markers: For the rest of the game,
any effects on cards marked with this icon are
active for you.
```
Some effects will work with just 1 genetic marker, while others
require you to reach the second marker at the end of the research
track.

When you reach the first genetic marker, for the rest of the game,
you may put Tleilaxu cards you acquire on top of your deck.

When you reach the second genetic marker, for the rest of the
game, triggering the research icon no longer advances your
research token; instead, draw a card.

#### THE TLEILAXU TRACK

```
Each time you gain a Tleilaxu icon, advance your Tleilaxu
token 1 space on the Tleilaxu track. When your Tleilaxu
token reaches a space with a bonus, gain it immediately.
```
A player gains a VP when they reach the central victory point
space, and the first player to reach it takes an additional bonus:
the 2 spice placed here during setup.

## TLEILAXU CARDS

```
Tleilaxu cards are similar to Imperium cards, however they come
from the Tleilaxu row and cost specimens to acquire.
```
```
Whenever the specimen icon appears on a card or board
space, generate 1 specimen: take a troop from your
supply and place it in the Axolotl tanks on the Tleilaxu
board.
```
```
You can spend your specimens in the Axolotl tanks to acquire a
Tleilaxu card in the Tleilaxu row (paying the specimen cost shown
in the top right corner) or to pay for an effect with a specimen cost
on one of your cards. Whenever you spend a specimen, return it to
your supply. You may return any of your specimens to your supply
at any time.
```
```
The Tleilaxu Row must always have 2 cards plus Reclaimed
Forces. Whenever it does not, replace missing cards from the top
of the Tleilaxu deck. The Reclaimed Forces card is never removed
from the Tleilaxu Row. When you ‘acquire’ it, choose one of its
effects (recruit 2 troops, or advance their Tleilaxu token 1 space
on the Tleilaxu track), but leave the card in place.
```
```
You can’t acquire Tleilaxu cards using effects that acquire
cards from the Imperium row. Since Tleilaxu cards don’t cost
persuasion, you can’t acquire them using effects that refer to or
modify a persuasion cost.
```
## GRAFT

```
These cards have a modified agent box with a special background
and the word GRAFT above it.
```
```
When you play a GRAFT card during an agent turn, it can’t be
played alone. You must play 2 cards (and only 2) on that turn. You
may either play 2 GRAFT cards together, or one card with GRAFT
and one without.
```
```
You may use an agent icon from either card to send your agent to
a board space. Both played cards are considered to have ‘sent’
the agent, no matter which card’s icon you use.
You gain the effects on both cards, in addition to the board space
effects, in any order you choose.
GRAFT cards may be revealed as usual during your reveal turn,
for the effects in their reveal boxes.
When you play a pair of cards using GRAFT, both cards are
considered to be grafted together. Additional effects can be
triggered on some cards ‘if grafted.’
```
```
When a card refers to ‘the other grafted card,’ it means the card
it’s grafted to.
```
## FAMILY ATOMICS

```
Each player receives a family atomics token during
setup. Once per game, you may spend yours during your
turn (returning it to the box) to remove all cards from the
Imperium row, then deal a new Imperium row from the
top of the Imperium deck.
```
## VARIANTS

#### EPIC GAME MODE FROM RISE OF IX

```
If you add Immortality to the Rise of Ix epic game mode, do
not replace any of the 10 starting cards with Control the Spice.
Instead, each player places their Control the Spice in their discard
pile at the start of the game.
```
#### GO TO 11

```
For those groups desiring a longer game (including veteran and
tournament players), play to 11 VPs. For a 4 player game, start at
0 and play to 10.
```
## SOLO GAMES

```
These rules govern how rivals in a solo game interact with
Immortality; these rules don’t apply to 2 player games.
```
#### SETUP

```
Remove the 3 original Carthag cards from the House Hagal deck.
```
```
Shuffule the 4 new House Hagal cards from Immortality into the
House Hagal deck (3 new Carthag cards and a Research Station
card).
```
```
Place Tleilaxu tokens for each rival at the start of the Tleilaxu
track. Do not place tokens for your rivals on the research track
(rivals don’t use it).
```
```
If you’d like solo games to allow a little more time for maneuvers
and schemes, consider using the Go to 11 variant.
```
#### NEW HOUSE HAGAL CARDS

```
Tleilaxu track: If a rival uses a House Hagal card with a
Tleilaxu icon to send an agent, it also advances 1 space on
the Tleilaxu track, gaining any bonus on the new space.
Tleilaxu row: These icons on a House Hagal
card reference 2 of the cards in the Tleilaxu
row (not Reclaimed Forces). Whenever a rival
uses such a card to send an agent, remove and replace the card
corresponding to the crossed-out icon (either the left or the right
card).
```
## CLARIFICATIONS

```
Clandestine Meeting: To play this card on an agent turn, you must
somehow add at least 1 agent icon to it (eg, by grafting it.)
```
```
Dispatch an Envoy: If you play 2 cards grafted together to send an
agent, choose which card gains the agent icons.
```
```
Ghola: If you graft this card with Power Play to send an agent to a
faction board space, you gain only 2 influence with that faction,
the same as if you’d played Power Play alone.
```
```
Ghola copies the entire agent box of the card it’s grafted to,
including effects like Trash this card.
```
```
If you graft Ghola to a Bene Gesserit card with an effect that
checks ‘if you have a Bene Gesserit card in play’ (such as
Reverend Mother Mohiam), the Ghola’s version of the effect will
count that Bene Gesserit card in play. However, Ghola can’t be
counted by other cards looking for a Bene Gesserit card, since it is
not itself a Bene Gesserit card.
```
```
If you graft Ghola to Weirding Way (from Rise of Ix), you may take
2 extra turns in a row.
```
```
Ilesa Ecaz: When you graft a card to the one you set aside using
this leader (from Rise of Ix), you receive 1 spice or 1 solari
depending on the icons of the card you set aside, even if you send
your agent to a board space allowed by the other grafted card.
```
```
Kwisatz Haderach: This card’s agent effect replaces the normal
rules for sending an agent to a board space. If you graft another
card to it, you still only send 1 agent that turn. Even Ghola won’t
allow you to send a second agent in a single turn.
Spaceport: This tech tile (from Rise of Ix) allows you to put
Tleilaxu cards you acquire on top of your deck, even if your
research token hasn’t reached the first genetic marker.
```
```
Usurp: You may graft this to another card in your hand instead
of grafting it to a card in the Imperium row. A grafted card in the
Imperium row isn’t considered to be in play.
```
```
Trashing a card with Usurp does trigger effects like Replacement
Eyes and cards with unload (from Rise of Ix).
```
