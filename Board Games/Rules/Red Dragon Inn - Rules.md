###### Introduction

Welcome to the Undercity! If you have never played The Red Dragon Inn before, please
read the first few pages of this document (up to “Other Rules”), plus the section describing the
characters, starting on page 8. The other sections include clarifications and variants that you
probably won’t need during your first game.
If you have played before, pages 8 and 9 will tell you everything you need to know about
the new characters.

########## Object of the Game

Keep your Gold and stay conscious. If you run out of Gold, or if your Alcohol Content is
ever greater than or equal to your Fortitude, you are out of the game.

###### Getting Started

Shuffle the 30-card Drink Deck and place it where everyone can reach it. Leave space for
a discard pile next to the Drink Deck.

Each player chooses a character and takes all the material for that character.
Shuffle your Character Deck and place it next to the space labeled Deck on your player mat.
When you must discard Character Deck Cards, place them next to the space labeled Discard
on your player mat.

Take 10 Gold and place it near your player mat where everyone can see it. This is your
“Stash.” (For games with 2 players, take 8 Gold instead. For games with 7 or more players,
take 12 Gold instead.) Put the extra Gold to the side. This is the “Inn.”

```
Place a red Fortitude Marker on the 20 on your player mat to track your Fortitude. Place
```
```
a clear Alcohol Content Marker on the 0 on your player mat to track your Alcohol Content.
Take a card from the Drink Deck and place it face down next to the space labeled Drink
Me! This is your Drink Me! Pile. Do not look at the cards in your Drink Me! Pile yet.
Draw the top seven cards from your Character Deck. This is your hand. You may look at
these cards, but you must keep them hidden from the other players.
Choose someone to go first.
```
###### On Your Turn

```
Your turn consists of four Phases, which must be played in order: Discard and Draw,
Action, Order a Drink, Drink.
```
########## 1. Discard and Draw

```
You may discard any cards from your hand that you do not want and then draw from your
Character Deck until you are holding seven cards. You may not play any cards or effects until
you have finished drawing cards.
If you draw the last card from your Character Deck, shuffle your discarded Character Cards
and put them back on the Deck space on your player mat.
If you are holding seven or more cards you may opt to keep all of them and draw no new
cards.
```
########## 2. Action

```
You may play one Action Card. To play an
Action Card, read the title of the card out loud
and pick the affected player(s). Give other players
a chance to respond to the card, then follow any
instructions on the card and discard it to the
Discard space on your Player Mat.
If you play a “Gambling? I’m in!” card, you
start a Round of Gambling (see “Gambling” on
page 4 for more details).
If you cannot or do not want to play an Action
Card, you don’t have to.
```
########## 3. Order a Drink

```
Take the top card from the Drink Deck and
place it face down, without looking at it, on top
of any other player’s Drink Me! Pile.
If the Drink Deck runs out of cards, each
player must pay the tavern 1 Gold to serve up a
new round of Drinks. (See “More Drink Rules”
on page 5 for details.)
```
########## 4. Drink

```
Reveal the top card of your Drink Me! Pile, follow the instructions on the card and place
it in the Drink Deck discard pile. Some of the instructions on Drink Cards are represented by
icons:
```
```
If you don’t have any cards in your Drink Me! Pile when you have to drink, you start to
sober up; reduce your Alcohol Content by one.
```
########## Ending Your Turn

```
After your Drink Phase, the player to your left goes next.
```
```
Gain [X] Alcohol Content
```
```
Add a Chaser - see “Chasers”
on page 5
```
```
Gain [X] Fortitude
```
```

```
Wine
Drink
```
```
Mmm. Classy!
9
```
```
Sign right here and
there you go!Action
```
```
Pick another player. They pay you 1
Gold. If it’s your Action Phase, you may
play another Action Card this phase.
You may spend 2 Momentum. If you do,
put the top card of your Drink Me! Pile
onto that player’s Drink Me! Pile.
```
```

rules and other resources!

```

###### Sometimes and Anytime Cards

```
Sometimes Cards can only be played under certain
conditions. Each Sometimes Card tells you when it can
be played in its text.
Some Sometimes Cards allow you to Negate or
Ignore another card. These cards are described under
“Negate and Ignore Effects” on page 6.
You may play multiple Sometimes Cards in response
to the same game event, even if they are multiple copies
of the same card. However, you must play the cards one
at a time and give your opponents an opportunity to
respond to each one.
```
Anytime Cards may be played at any time, even if
they interrupt another action.
Relevant Sometimes and Anytime Cards may be
played in any phase of a turn, either before or after the
special action for that phase. For example, you may play
an Anytime Card during your Discard and Draw Phase
before you discard and draw.
If two or more players would like to play Sometimes
or Anytime Cards at the same time, see “Timing” on
page 6.

###### Losing the Game

########## Running Out of Gold

```
If you run out of Gold, it’s back out to the Undercity for you. You are out of the game.
```
########## Passing Out

If your Alcohol Content is ever greater than or equal to your Fortitude, you fall unconscious
and the party continues without you. Your Gold is divided between the Inn and any players
still in the game. Split your Gold in half. One half, rounded up, goes to the Inn. What’s left
gets split evenly among the remaining players, with any remainder going to the Inn. You are
out of the game.

If you run out of Gold or pass out, you don’t lose immediately. First, finish resolving any
cards that have been played but have not yet resolved. After these cards resolve, you have one
last chance to play Sometimes or Anytime Cards to save yourself or attack others. If you can’t
save yourself, then you’re out of the game.
If you have any cards in your Drink Me! Pile when you lose, put them in the appropriate
discard pile(s).
It is possible for multiple players to lose at the same time. If this happens, first determine
which players are passing out. Each of those players divides their Gold among the players
who aren’t passing out, as described above. After this, if any players have no Gold, they
lose the game as well. This means that if one player passes out and another runs out of Gold
simultaneously, the player who is running out of Gold could be saved by getting a share of the
Gold from the other player!
If all remaining players would lose the game simultaneously, the game is a tie between
those players.

###### Gambling

```
When a player plays “Gambling? I’m in!” as their Action, this starts a Round of Gambling.
When a Round of Gambling begins, normal play is suspended and each player must ante
1 Gold, putting it in the middle of the table (making sure not to get it confused with the Inn’s
Gold). This counts as “losing Gold” for the purpose of cards which affect that.
The player who started the Round of Gambling is currently winning (“in control” of the
Round).
Play proceeds clockwise around the table from the player who started the Round. On your
turn you may either play a Gambling or Cheating Card or pass.
```
```
Play a Gambling or Cheating Card: Playing either of these two types of card gives you
control of the Round of Gambling. The card you play may have other effects, as well.
Pass: You may choose to pass instead of playing a card. You may pass even if you have a
Gambling or Cheating Card that you could play (and it is often correct to do so!). If you pass,
you are still in the Round of Gambling and may play Gambling or Cheating Cards later in the
Round, as long as the Round does not end first.
```
########## Ending the Round

```
If you play a Gambling or Cheating Card and everyone else passes, the Round of Gambling
ends, and you win. Take all of the anted Gold and add it to your Stash.
As soon as the last player passes, the Round of Gambling ends immediately. You may not
play cards that would affect the Round after this point unless the card explicitly states that you
can.
If a card effect says that you win the Round, the Round ends immediately, and you take
the anted Gold.
When the Round of Gambling is over, normal game play resumes. The player who started
the Round moves on to their Order a Drink Phase.
```
########## Winning Hand!

```
“Winning Hand!” is a special Gambling Card, because
only Cheating Cards (and a few specific other cards) can
be used to take control after it has been played. If “Winning
Hand!” is played and it is followed by a Cheating Card, then
any Gambling or Cheating Card can be played next. Just
remember:
```
**- A Cheating Card can be played after anything.
- A Gambling Card can be played after anything
except a “Winning Hand!”**

########## Leaving a Round of Gambling

```
Some cards allow you to leave a Round of Gambling. If you leave a Round of Gambling,
you cannot play Gambling or Cheating Cards for the rest of that Round, but you may still play
Sometimes or Anytime Cards. You are no longer affected by cards that require you to ante,
such as “I raise!” Any Gold that you previously anted stays in the pot.
If you play a card that requires players to ante, then immediately leave the Round (for
example, with “Gambling? I’m in!” followed by “Can’tcha see I’m sharpenin’ my tools?”),
then the Round proceeds normally, but currently has no winner. If the Round ends before any

player takes control, all anted Gold goes to the Inn.

########## Forcing a Player to Leave a Round of Gambling

Some cards force a player to leave a Round of Gambling. When a player is forced out of
the Round, each player, including the one being forced out, has a chance to respond with an
appropriate Sometimes Card.
If there is ever only one player left in the Round, the Round of Gambling ends and the
remaining player wins.

########## Running out of Gold During Gambling

If you run out of Gold during a Round of Gambling, you will remain in the game at least
until the Round of Gambling ends, even if you leave the Round of Gambling or are forced
out. Ignore any effects that force you to pay or ante Gold. If you do not win the Round of
Gambling, you are out of Gold and out of the game!
If you play a card that would require players to ante, but you cannot ante (because you are
out of Gold and cannot use a card like “How did this get in my snack pouch?”), then no player
is required to ante.

########## Gambling Example

```
On his turn, Jett plays “Gambling? I’m in!” to start a Round of Gambling.
Dale plays “Can’tcha see I’m sharpenin’ my tools?” to leave the Round of
Gambling. He does not have to ante, but he cannot play any Gambling or Cheating
Cards for the rest of this Round.
Jett, Terci and Ygella each ante one Gold. Since Jett started the Round, he’s
winning (in control).
Terci goes next and passes.
Ygella plays “I raise,” a Gambling Card that forces all players in the Round to
ante an additional Gold. Jett, Terci and Ygella each ante one more Gold (bringing
the pot to 6 Gold). The “I raise” card also puts Ygella in control of the Round of
Gambling, so she is now winning.
Jett plays “Winning Hand!” This is a special Gambling Card that can only be
beaten by Cheating Cards. Jett is now winning.
Terci plays “I’m a doctor, not a cheater”, which is (of course) a Cheating Card.
Terci is now winning.
Ygella passes.
Jett plays “Gambling? I’m In!” In addition to starting a Round of Gambling,
“Gambling? I’m in!” can be used during a Round to take control. Jett is now winning.
Terci passes and so does Ygella.
Jett wins the 6 Gold in the pot.
```
###### More Drink Rules

########## Running Out of Drinks

When you reach the end of the Drink Deck, each player must pay one Gold to the Inn to
get the tavern to bring more Drinks.
After each player pays one Gold, shuffle the discarded Drink Cards into a new Drink Deck.
This happens instantly, so the Drink Deck is never out of cards. Drink Cards that have been
put on Drink Me! Piles remain where they are.

########## Drink Events

```
Some cards in the Drink Deck are Drink Event Cards.
If you reveal a Drink Event, follow the instructions on
the card. Cards that affect Drinks do not affect Drink
Events unless they specifically say that they do so.
```
########## Chasers

```
If you reveal a Drink Card that has the phrase “with
a Chaser” in the title and/or the “+” mug icon, reveal the
next card from the deck from which you revealed the
previous Drink. If it’s a Drink Card, add its effects to
the original Drink. If it’s another Drink with a Chaser,
add its effects to the original Drink and continue this
process.
If no cards remain in your Drink Me! Pile when you
would reveal a Chaser from it, or if you reveal a Drink
Event as your Chaser, there is no additional effect. Do
not continue revealing cards, and if you revealed a Drink
Event, discard it without taking its effects. You do not
sober up if your Drink Me! Pile runs out while revealing
Chasers.
The Drink Deck is never out of cards, so if you run
out of cards while revealing Chasers from the Drink
Deck, follow the “Running Out of Drinks” rule above and then continue revealing Chasers.
The original Drink and its Chasers all count as a single Drink. A card that allows you to
Ignore a Drink will Ignore the original Drink and all of its Chasers.
No player may respond to a Drink until all of its Chasers have been revealed.
```
```
Chaser Example 1: Dale drinks from his Drink Me! Pile and gets Wine with a Chaser.
He reveals the next card on his Drink Me! Pile and gets Dragon Breath Ale. He adds the
effects of both Drinks, for a total Alcohol Content of 6. Dale plays “This’ll keep the vermin
offa my crops” to Ignore the Drink, so he gains no Alcohol Content.
```
```
Chaser Example 2: During a Drinking Contest, Terci reveals Light Ale with a Chaser
from the top of the Drink Deck. They reveal the next card from the Drink Deck and get
Round on the House! Since Round on the House is a Drink Event, it has no effect as a
Chaser and is discarded. Terci gains 1 Alcohol Content.
```
########## Discarding and Drawing

```
Some Drinks cause you to draw cards, discard cards or reveal cards from your Character
Deck. If a Drink includes multiple such effects due to Chasers or other effects added to the
Drink, resolve them in the order of your choice. However, you must fully resolve one such
ability before moving on to the next - you may not interrupt one ability to resolve another.
```
########## Drinks That Aren’t Discarded

```
Some Drinks, such as the Old-Fae-shioned in the Star
Mole Tavern Deck, instruct you to do something with a
physical Drink Card other than putting it in a discard pile after
it resolves. In certain cases, multiple players can end up being
affected by such an effect, but only one of those players can
move the physical card. If that happens, start with the player
who controlled the Drink when it resolved, or the active
player if the Drink had no single controller (like in the case of
“Round on the House”). Then proceed in turn order among all
players who were instructed to move the Drink, skipping any
players who Ignored the Drink or passed it to another player.
The first player in that order takes the indicated action with
the physical card. If no player is eligible to take the action, the
Drink goes to the Drink discard pile as normal.
```
```
Wine with a Chaser
Drink
```
```
Mmm. Classy!
9
```
```
Round on the House! Drink Event
```
```
Reveal a Drink (with possible Chasers)
from the Drink Deck. If you reveal a
Drink Event before revealing a Drink,
discard it and reveal again.
Each player (including you) drinks a
copy of the revealed Drink.
9
```
```
Put this card in front of
you. While it’s there, you
may play it as a Sometimes Card with the
effect “Ignore an Action,
```
```
Old Fae-shioned
```
```
Sometimes or Anytime Card that
affects your Fortitude.”
```
```
Drink
```

```
Example: On her Drink Phase, Ygella reveals Old Fae-shioned. She plays “This’ll
curl your whiskers!” to split the Drink with Petra. Ygella and Petra each gain 2 Alcohol
Content. Since Ygella is the first affected player in turn order, she puts the Old Fae-shioned
in front of her. Unfortunately for Petra, she does not gain the benefit of the Drink.
```
########## Ordering Additional Drinks

Some cards allow you to order additional Drinks during your Order a Drink Phase. When
you do this, you may put the Drinks face down on any other players’ Drink Me! Piles. They
can all go to the same player, or they can be distributed however you like among multiple
players.

###### Other Rules

########## Minimum and Maximum Fortitude, Alcohol Content, Gold

Your Fortitude and Alcohol Content can never go below 0 or above 20. Your Gold can
never go below 0, but it has no maximum. If the Inn runs out of Gold Pieces, use some other
markers as a substitute.
If a card effect cannot fully take effect due to these limits, the card still takes effect as
completely as it is able.

```
Example: Petra is at 0 Alcohol Content. Fleck (from RDI 2) plays “And now I’m going
to play something really sad” to make each player lose 1 Alcohol Content and pay him
1 Gold. Petra cannot lose 1 Alcohol Content, since she is already at 0, but she still must
pay Fleck 1 Gold.
```
########## Cards That Affect Your Fortitude, Alcohol Content, Gold

Some cards specify that they can be played in response to a card that affects your Fortitude,
Alcohol Content or Gold. A card affects one of these attributes only if it would directly change
that attribute when it takes effect.
If a card would normally affect an attribute but can’t because that attribute is already at its
minimum or maximum value, the card is still considered to affect that attribute.
You may not Ignore a Round of Gambling with a card that allows you to Ignore a card that
affects your Gold.

```
Example 1: Terci plays “Tip the Barkeep” to make Ygella
pay 1 Gold to the Inn. In response, Ygella plays “Uh-oh!
Time to dig our way out of trouble!”, allowing her to Ignore
the card, since it would directly change her Gold.
Example 2: Ygella reveals Wine on her Drink Phase.
Dale plays “Mushroom spores, pixie dust, same difference!”
to add 1 Alcohol Content to the Wine. Ygella may not play
“Time to dig our way out of trouble” here, because Dale’s
card is not changing Ygella’s Alcohol Content directly—it is
changing the effects of the Wine.
Example 3: Ygella reveals Dragon Breath Ale on her
Drink Phase. She plays “I’ve drunk stronger stuff running
down cavern walls!” to Ignore the Drink. Jett plays “I don’t
think so!” to Negate Ygella’s Ignore card. Ygella may not
play “Time to dig our way out of trouble” here, because Jett’s
card is not changing Ygella’s Alcohol Content directly—it is
Negating Ygella’s card that would allow her to Ignore the Drink.
Example 4: Ygella wins a Round of Gambling. At the end of the Round, Gerki (from the
original Red Dragon Inn game) plays “Um...I know you think you won, but...” to take the
pot. Ygella may not play “Time to dig our way out of trouble” here, because Gerki’s card is
not directly changing Ygella’s Gold. It is affecting the outcome of the Round of Gambling.
```
########## Negate and Ignore Effects

Some Sometimes Cards allow you to Negate or Ignore another card.
When you Negate a card, you completely prevent it from resolving. The Negated card goes
to the appropriate discard pile. None of its effects happen.

```
When you Ignore a card, the card resolves normally, but it has no effect on you. It still
affects other players as usual.
```
```
Negate Example: Jett plays “Sorry ‘bout the claws” on Ygella. Ygella loses 2
Fortitude, then plays “Careful! They swarm when threatened” to try to hit Jett back. Jett
responds with “I don’t think so!” Ygella’s card is Negated, so it has no effect. Jett loses
no Fortitude.
```
```
Ignore Example: Ygella plays “Group hug!” to make each other player lose 1
Fortitude. In response, Jett plays “Rise above adversity” to Ignore the card. Jett does not
lose Fortitude, but the other players do, since Ygella’s card affects them normally when
it resolves.
```
```
Cards do not Negate or Ignore other cards unless they specifically use the word “Negate”
or the word “Ignore.” So, for example, cards which reduce or redirect damage, reduce Alcohol
Content, or pass Drinks to other players are not Negating or Ignoring anything.
Many cards allow you to Ignore a Drink. You may only play a card of this type on a Drink
that would affect you in some way. You may not Ignore someone else’s Drink unless that
player first passes it to you or splits it with you, or if you would somehow take effects from it.
Some cards allow you to Ignore a card that affects your Gold. You may not use such a card
to avoid a Gold payment on a card that you played yourself. You may still use cards that reduce
payments or pay with Gold from the Inn, however.
Some cards allow you to Ignore an Event. This includes Drink Events, Tavern Events,
Sea Events and Dungeon Events. You may not Ignore an Event after it has started resolving
in order to selectively Ignore the later parts of the Event. (This can be relevant for cards like
Drinking Contest.)
```
########## Timing

```
Whenever any card is played or a Drink or Event is revealed, each player (in turn order,
starting with the player who played or revealed the card) may play relevant Sometimes Cards
in response.
If no player has any response to a card, that card resolves and its instructions are carried
out.
If a player plays a response to a card and that response resolves, each player (in turn
order, as above) has another opportunity to respond to the original card. If no player does, the
original card resolves.
```
```
Timing Example 1: Jett reveals Light Ale during his Drink Phase. He is holding
“Parkour!”, which would allow him to Ignore the Drink. He chooses not to play it, since
the Drink only has an Alcohol Content of 1. Dale plays “Mushroom spores, pixie dust,
same difference!” to add 1 Alcohol Content to the Light Ale. After Dale’s card resolves,
Jett will have another opportunity to play “Parkour!” to Ignore the spiked Light Ale, even
though he previously chose not to respond.
```
```
If two or more players are instructed to reveal and drink Drinks at the same time (for
example, with the Drink Event “Drinking Contest!”), they first reveal Drink Cards and
Chasers, as appropriate. After that, in turn order (as above), players may play Sometimes
```
```
I don’t think so!
Sometimes
```
```
Negate a Sometimes Card.
This card can only be affected
by another I don't think so!
```
```
Sometimes
```
```
Ignore a Drink.
(Reveal the Drink first!)
```
```
Oh hey, alcohol is sterile!
```
```
Sometimes - Pet
```
```
Ignore an Action, Sometimes or
Anytime Card that affects your
Fortitude, Alcohol Content or Gold.
You may not use this card to Ignore a
Round of Gambling.
```
```
Uh-oh! Time to dig our
way out of trouble!
```

Cards that modify Drinks. Anytime Cards may also be played here. When no player has any
further responses, each player drinks their Drink simultaneously.
If two or more players wish to respond to the same game event with Sometimes or Anytime
Cards, players should take back their plays, then play and resolve their Anytime Cards in turn
order, beginning from the player whose turn it is. After that, they should play and resolve their
Sometimes Cards in the same way.
If a situation arises in which two or more players are each waiting for the others to act
before making a decision, the deadlock should be broken with a similar method. In turn order,
beginning with the player whose turn it is, each player declares their choice, then the game
continues normally.

```
Timing Example 2: Jett is at 12 Fortitude and 10 Alcohol Content. On his Drink
Phase he reveals Elven Wine. In order to keep from passing out, he plays “Parkour!” to
Ignore the Drink. Terci (sitting to Jett’s left) and Dale (sitting to Terci’s left) each hold an
“I don’t think so!”, and each suspects that the other is holding one. Both Terci and Dale
are interested in Negating Jett’s Ignore card, but neither wants to be the one to spend their
critical “I don’t think so!” To resolve the deadlock, first Terci, then Dale must either play
a response to Jett’s card or choose not to. If neither Terci nor Dale decides to play “I don’t
think so!” on Jett’s card, he Ignores his Drink and remains in the game.
```
If two or more players wish to respond to sequential game events that occur as the result
of a card being played, then players should take back their plays, then play them sequentially.

```
Timing Example 3: Ygella plays “Group hug!” to make each other player lose 1
Fortitude. At this point, Jett wants to play “Rise above adversity” to Ignore the effect and
Terci wants to play “Take that and call me in the morning” to hit Ygella back. Since the
game event of responding to Ygella’s card happens before the game event of players losing
Fortitude, Jett plays his card first. Once that card takes effect, Ygella’s card resolves,
causing the other players to each lose 1 Fortitude. After that happens, Terci may play their
card to hit Ygella back.
```
########## Cards that “Change the Effects of a Drink”

Several cards allow you to Negate a Sometimes Card that changes the effects of a Drink.
Negating or Ignoring a Drink, passing a Drink to another player, splitting a Drink, and
increasing or decreasing a Drink’s Alcohol Content are all considered changing the Drink’s
effects, so such cards can be played in all of these cases.
Cards that Order Drinks, force a player to drink, or directly increase a player’s Alcohol
Content do not count as changing the effects of a Drink.
Altering or interacting with a Drink Event does not count as changing the effects of a
Drink, since a Drink Event is not a Drink.
Negating a card that would change the effects of a Drink does not itself count as changing
the effects of a Drink. (Quite the opposite, in fact!)

########## Splitting Drinks

When a card is played that can split or duplicate a Drink, it creates separate, independent
Drinks. A card that affects a Drink can only affect one of the split Drinks unless it specifically
says otherwise. If a Drink is altered before it is split, then the altered Drink is split.
To split a Drink with one or more Chasers, first combine all like numeric effects (Alcohol
Content, Fortitude, drawing cards, etc.), then split each combined effect in half, rounding up.

```
Split Example 1: Ygella reveals an Elven Wine (3 Alcohol Content). She plays “This’ll
curl your whiskers!”, which splits the Drink into two Drinks with 2 Alcohol Content each
(3 Alcohol Content split in half, then rounded up). Dale then plays “Mushroom spores,
pixie dust, same difference!” to add 1 Alcohol Content to one of the two Drinks. The result
is one Drink with 2 Alcohol Content and another with 3 Alcohol Content.
```
```
Split Example 2: Dale plays “Mushroom spores, pixie dust, same difference!” as soon
as the Elven Wine is revealed, making the Elven Wine a Drink with 4 Alcohol Content.
Ygella then plays “This’ll curl your whiskers!”, creating two Drinks with 2 Alcohol
Content each.
```
########## Self-Splitting Drinks

```
Some Drinks, such as Mead, have their own built-in split effects. When a player reveals
one of these Drinks, players first get an opportunity to affect the Drink. When players are done
affecting the Drink, the player who revealed it may choose a player with whom to split it.
Players then have another opportunity to affect the split halves of the Drink. Because players
have an opportunity to affect the Drink after it is split, the
two players sharing the Drink could end up taking different
effects from it!
```
```
Example: Jett reveals Mead during his Drink Phase.
No player alters the Drink, so he decides to split it with
Terci. This creates two copies of Mead with 2 Alcohol
Content each (half of 3 rounded up). After this, Dale
plays “Mushroom spores, pixie dust, same difference!”
on Terci’s Mead, giving it a total Alcohol Content of 3.
Each player then drinks their half, so Jett gains 2 Alcohol
Content and Terci gains 3.
```
```
If a self-splitting Drink is the result of a Drink Event or
is revealed as a Chaser to another Drink, it may not be split
with another player. The player drinking the Drink takes
its full effects.
```
########## Round on the House

```
The card Round on the House is similar to a split effect, but is not considered a split
effect. When a Drink is revealed for Round on the House, each player immediately receives
a separate, independent copy of that Drink. Players do not have an opportunity to affect the
Drink before it is copied, but may affect the individual copies afterward.
```
########## Drinking Contest

```
When a player reveals a Drinking Contest card, each player, starting with the player whose
turn it is, reveals the top card of the Drink Deck. If that card is a Drink Event, it has no effect
and counts as a 0 Alcohol Content Drink. If it is a Drink with a Chaser, the player continues
revealing Drink Cards as appropriate. Once all players have revealed one or more cards
from the Drink Deck, players may, in turn order, play Sometimes Cards that modify Drinks.
Anytime Cards may also be played here. When all players are done playing cards, each player
drinks and discards their Drink, then the player who revealed the Drink with the highest total
Alcohol Content receives one Gold from each other player.
If two or more players tie for the Drink with the highest
total Alcohol Content, the tied players repeat the process
of revealing, modifying, drinking and discarding Drinks
until there is a clear winner. If all tied players but one
pass out during this process, the remaining player wins
the Drinking Contest and does not continue drinking. If
all tied players pass out during this process, the Drinking
Contest has no winner.
If a player would win the Drinking Contest and pass
out at the same time, that player collects Gold for winning
the contest, then passes out.
If a player passes out during a Drinking Contest,
that player loses the game, but does not split their Gold
among the other players until after the Drinking Contest
is completed. Players who lose the game in this way still
must pay one Gold to the winner of the Drinking Contest
before splitting their Gold.
Cards that increase or decrease the Alcohol Content of a Drink will affect the outcome of
a Drinking Contest. If a Drink is split, Ignored, or given to another player, this does not affect
the outcome of the contest. If a player somehow takes extra Drinks during a Drinking Contest,
these extra Drinks do not affect the outcome of the Drinking Contest.
If a Drink’s total Alcohol Content is less than 0 (such as Pot of Tea), it counts as a 0
Alcohol Content Drink in a Drinking Contest. The Drink will still affect your Alcohol Content
as normal.
```
```
If Mead was not the result of a
Drink Event or Chaser, you may split it with another
player (round up).
Mead any other card that splits a cannot be affected by
Drink.
It’s so good you just have to share!
```
```
Mead

```
Drinking Contest!

```
Each player reveals a Drink from the Drink Deck and drinks it. The player who reveals
the Drink with the highest Alcohol Content (even if they avoid the effects of the Drink)
wins 1 Gold from each other player.
If and drink again until there is a winner.there is a tie, the players who tied reveal
The effects of Drink Event Cards and they count as 0 Alcohol Content.are ignored
9
```

```
Drinking Contest Example 1: In a Drinking Contest, Petra reveals Wine (2 Alcohol
Content), and Jett reveals Light Ale (1 Alcohol Content). Dale plays “Mushroom spores,
pixie dust, same difference!” to increase the Alcohol Content of Jett’s Drink to 2, causing
his Drink to tie with Petra’s. Petra and Jett each gain 2 Alcohol Content, then the Drinking
Contest continues.
```
```
Drinking Contest Example 2: In another Drinking Contest, Ygella reveals Dragon
Breath Ale (4 Alcohol Content), and Terci reveals Dark Ale (1 Alcohol Content). Ygella
plays “This’ll curl your whiskers!” to split her Drink with Terci. Terci gains a total of 3
Alcohol Content and Ygella gains 2 Alcohol Content, but Ygella still wins the Drinking
Contest.
```
If you run out of Gold during a Drinking Contest, you will remain in the game at least until
the Drinking Contest is finished. Ignore any effects that force you to pay Gold. If you do not
win the Drinking Contest, you are out of Gold and out of the game!

```
Drinking Contest Example 3: Petra has 1 Gold, and reveals a Drinking Contest on
her Drink Phase. As Drinks are revealed by each player, the Drink Deck runs out, so
everyone pays 1 Gold to the Inn to get a new round of Drinks. Petra pays her last Gold, so
she will be out of the game if she does not win. She reveals a Dragon Breath Ale and wins
the Drinking Contest, receiving a Gold from each other player and staying in the game.
```
## Character Rules

###### Dale the Mycologist

Dale is a farmer who made the unusual choice (for a pixie, anyway) to move to the
Undercity to cultivate mushrooms. He is known for the fine quality of his crops, both culinary
and medicinal.

```
Setup: Shuffle the 15-card Mushroom Deck and put
it next to your player mat. Reveal the top card of the
Mushroom Deck and put it in the “Planter Box” above
your player mat, then put a Rake Token pointing to the
topmost number on that card. The Rake Token indicates the
Mushroom’s current Harvest Value.
```
```
Mushrooms: Dale’s Mushrooms are planted in his
Planter Box and grow over time. You may Harvest these
cards to enhance cards you play from your hand. At the end
of your turn you will Gather any fully-grown Mushrooms
that have not yet been Harvested.
```
**Plant:** To Plant a Mushroom, reveal the top card of the
Mushroom Deck, put it into the Planter Box and put a Rake
Token on the topmost number on that card. The Planter Box
may hold a maximum of four Mushrooms. If you would Plant a Mushroom but there are
already four in the Planter Box, reveal the Mushroom you would plant, then either discard a
Mushroom from your Planter Box to make room for the newly-revealed Mushroom or discard
the newly-revealed Mushroom. No player may take any game actions until after you have
made this choice. If the Mushroom Deck runs out of cards, shuffle the Mushroom discards and
use that as the new Mushroom Deck.

**Grow:** To Grow a Mushroom, move its Rake Token down one spot. In most cases, this
will cause the Mushroom’s Harvest Value to increase. If you would Grow a Mushroom whose
Rake Token is already pointing to its bottom-most number, nothing happens.

```
Beginning of Turn: At the beginning of your turn, before your Discard and Draw Phase,
```
```
first Grow all Mushrooms in your Planter Box, then Plant
a Mushroom.
```
```
Harvest: Many cards in Dale’s Character Deck have
an improved effect if you Harvest Mushrooms from your
Planter Box as you play them. When you play a card
with a Harvest effect, you may discard Mushrooms with
a total Harvest Value equal to or greater than the Harvest
number listed on the played card. If you do, the Harvest
effect happens. If a Harvest effect uses the word “instead”,
it replaces the base effect. Otherwise, the Harvest effect is
added to the base effect.
```
```
Harvesting is an additional cost that you must pay as you
play the card. You may not wait to see if other players want
to respond, then decide to pay the Harvest cost. If you pay
a Harvest cost and your card is Negated or Ignored, you do not get your Harvest cost back.
There is no additional effect if you overpay a Harvest cost, and you may not pay a Harvest cost
multiple times on a single card.
```
```
Gather: At the end of your turn, you must discard any Mushroom whose Rake Token is
pointing to its bottom-most Harvest Value. If any card discarded in this way has a Gather effect,
resolve that effect as you discard the card. A Gather effect may be responded to as though it
came from an Action Card that you played from your hand. Note that The Evershroom is an
exception to the “forced Gather” rule. It is never Gathered - it simply stays on its bottom-most
Harvest Value for as long as you like!
```
```
You do not get the Gather effect for any Mushroom used to pay a Harvest cost, even if that
Mushroom was on its bottom-most Harvest Value.
```
###### Jett the Courier

```
The fastest courier in the Undercity is ready to deliver any package at lightning speed.
After hours, he likes to relax at the Star Mole Drinking Hole, but he generally likes to keep
moving, even while off-duty.
```
```
Setup: Place the Momentum Tracker Card next to your
player mat with Jett’s Hat Token on the “0” space.
```
```
Momentum: Many of Jett’s cards cause his Momentum
to change. In addition, many cards have a different effect
depending on his Momentum, which can range from 0 to 3.
```
```
If a card causes you to Gain or Lose Momentum, that
is part of the card’s effects, so if the card is Negated, you
do not gain or lose the Momentum. If it gets Ignored or
otherwise altered, your Momentum changes as normal. You
may play a card that causes you to lose Momentum even if
you have less Momentum than the card would make you
lose.
```
```
Spending Momentum: If an effect allows you to Spend Momentum, that is an additional
cost to play the effect, so you must have at least that much Momentum to spend in order to
activate that effect. If the card is Negated or Ignored, you do not get the spent Momentum
back.
```
```
Beginning of Turn: At the beginning of your turn, before your Discard and Draw Phase,
gain 1 Momentum.
```
```
Pick another player. They
lose 2 Fortitude.
Harvest 3: They also gain 1
Alcohol Content.
```
```
Action
```
```
Nosiree, those aren’t edible.
```
```
Yer Classic Tallcap
```
```
Gather: No effect.
```

```
Setup: Shuffle the 14-card Patient Deck and place it next to your player mat. Reveal the
top two cards from the Patient Deck and place them in the “Waiting Patient” slots above your
player mat. Keep the 3 Salve Tokens, 3 Splint Tokens and 3 Bandage Tokens near your player
mat.
```
```
Medical Supplies: Many cards in Terci’s Character
Deck have a Medical Supplies icon in the bottom left. When
you play such a card, take one of that Medical Supply Token
and put it on your player mat after all other effects on the
card have been carried out. If the card has a split icon with
multiple Medical Supplies, choose one of the tokens shown.
```
```
Patients: Terci’s Patients can be treated with the right
combination of Medical Supplies. At any time, you may
spend a Patient’s required Medical Supply Tokens from
your player mat, putting them back into the supply. If you
do, take that Patient Card into your hand. It now counts as a
card in your hand of the given type (representing the often-
non-monetary compensation that the Patient gives you).
Patient Cards in your hand act like any other cards in your
hand - you may discard them to effects that cause you to
discard cards, and they count toward your hand limit.
```
```
Example: During a Round of Gambling, Terci
plays “Sometimes, my patients actually pay me!” to
avoid paying Gold. They take a Salve Token and put
it on their player mat. Later, they use that Salve Token
to treat the hung-over adventurer. They remove the
Salve Token from their player mat and put the Patient
Card into their hand. It now counts as a Sometimes
Card that can spike a Drink.
```
```
Beginning of Turn: At the beginning of your turn, before your Discard and Draw Phase,
fill any empty Waiting Patient slots by revealing new cards from the Patient Deck. Note that
you may not discard Waiting Patients unless a card specifically says that you may do so. To
get more Patients, you’ll have to treat (or discard) the ones you have, then wait for new ones
to come through the door!
```
```
Other Rules: If a card that would give you a Medical Supply Token is Negated, you don’t
get the token. If it is Ignored or otherwise altered, you do. If you would gain a Medical Supply
Token, but all three of that particular token are already on your player mat, you don’t gain
anything. If your Patient Deck runs out, shuffle the Patient discard pile and use that as the new
Patient Deck.
```
###### Beastsergeant Ygella

```
Ygella is a high-ranking member of the Runoff Rangers,
a team of experts charged with keeping the Undercity safe
from the many wild beasts that live under the surface. She is
highly skilled at befriending those wild beasts and enlisting
their help!
```
```
Pets: Many cards in Ygella’s deck have the subtype
“Pet”. This is shown both by the type line under the title
and by the paw symbol in the upper left. Several of Ygella’s
cards refer to Pet Cards, allowing her to get fancy with
those cards!
```
###### Petra the Devious

Petra earned her “devious” moniker by maneuvering her way onto the governing board of
the Thieves’ Guild. Her passion for plotting and scheming makes her a dangerous foe!

**Setup:** Place the Hellfire Tracker Card next to your player mat with the Hellfire Token on
the lowest-numbered space. Be sure to use the side that says “Hellfire” unless you are playing
Petra as the Boss in the Boss Battle Variant (see page 12).

```
Schemes: Many of Petra’s cards have the subtype
Scheme. These cards have a different effect if they are
played from the Plotted Cards area than they would have
if played from your hand. If a Scheme is played from the
Plotted Cards area, use the effect marked with the icon.
If a Scheme effect uses the word “instead”, it replaces the
base effect. Otherwise, the Scheme effect is added to the
base effect. A Scheme played from the Plotted Cards area
may be responded to just like a card played from your hand.
```
**Plotting Cards:** After your Discard and Draw Phase,
or whenever a card says so, you may Plot a card from your
hand. To do this, put a card from your hand face down into
the Plotted Cards area above your player mat. You may
put any card face down in this way, but you may only play
Schemes from the Plotted Cards area. There is no limit to the number of cards that can be in
your Plotted Cards area.

**Hellfire:** Petra’s Hellfire causes her to deal periodic
extra damage. When you gain Hellfire, move the Hellfire
Token up on the circular Hellfire track. If the Hellfire Token
gets to the “fire” spot, resolve the effect at the bottom of
the Hellfire card, then move the Hellfire Token back to the
first spot. If you would gain Hellfire that would move you
past the fire spot, first move to the fire spot, then resolve the
Hellfire effect, then continue gaining Hellfire.

**Beginning of Turn:** Before your Discard and Draw
Phase, first discard all Plotted Cards and gain 1 Hellfire for
each card discarded in this way. Then Discard and Draw as
normal. After this, you may Plot one card from your hand.

**Other Rules:** You may look at your face-down Plotted
Cards at any time. Plotted Cards may be played as though
they were in your hand, but they are not actually part of your hand. This means, for example,
that you may not discard them to effects that cause you to discard cards from your hand. It also
means that a player may not look at them if they play an effect allowing them to look at your
hand. Petra may Plot only her own Character Cards. She may not Plot other cards that could
end up in her hand, such as Murgath’s Blessings.

**Boss Battle:** Petra may be played as the Boss in the Boss Battle Variant (see page 12).
If you do this, be sure to shuffle in the 15-card Boss Deck (with dragon heads in the corners).
In addition, Boss Petra uses the “Boss Battle” side of her Hellfire Tracker Card, which has a
more powerful ability when it fires!

###### Doctor Terci

Doctor Terci is one of a small handful of non-magical healers in town, always ready to
discreetly provide medical help to Undercitizens in need. Terci will ply their craft anywhere -
in the privacy of their office, or in a busy tavern!

```

Drink: In any order, each player on the active team drinks the top card of their Drink Me!
Pile. A player reveals and completely resolves their Drink before their next teammate drinks.
This means that you must decide whether or not to Ignore your Drink before seeing what
Drinks your teammates get!
Remember that you may Ignore a Drink on behalf of a teammate!
```
########## Drink Rules

```
Each player in a team game has their own individual Drink Me! Pile. Each player’s Drink
Me! Pile starts the game with one Drink Card on it, as usual.
You may not pass a Drink you are about to drink to a teammate or split a Drink with a
teammate.
When the Drink Deck runs out of cards, each team ( not each individual player) pays 1 Gold
to the Inn to get a new round of Drinks.
```
########## Gambling, Events and Team Champions

```
Many card effects, such as a Round of Gambling or a Drinking Contest, would normally
force multiple players on a team to face off against one another. In these cases, the team chooses
a player to act as their Champion. A team chooses a Champion in each of the following cases:
```
**- An Event would affect all players
- A Round of Gambling begins
- A player plays a card that would affect “each player (including you)”**

```
If a player reveals a Drink Event, starts a Round of Gambling, or plays an “each player
(including you)” effect, that player is automatically chosen as their team’s Champion. If a
team reveals a Sea Event or Dungeon Event at the end of their shared turn, they still choose
a Champion for the Event, regardless of which teammate revealed the card. If a member of
a team Crawls to a new Tavern in the Pub Crawl Variant, each team chooses a Champion,
including the team that Crawled.
Each time a team must choose a Champion, they may choose a different teammate. In other
words, you do not need to choose the same player to be your Champion for the entire game.
```
```
Drink Events: When a player reveals a Drink Event that would affect all players, the player
who revealed the Drink Event is automatically chosen as their team’s Champion. Each other
team chooses a Champion, then the Drink Event resolves normally, affecting only the chosen
Champions. However, each Champion’s teammates may still play defensive Sometimes Cards
to help out. (Note that this means that a team’s choice of Champion often doesn’t matter in the
case of Events. See “Static Effects” below for an important exception!)
```
```
Event Example 1: Boss Petra reveals “Round on
the House!” The Challengers choose Zakhan (from RDI
5) as their Champion so he can gain some Drunken
Chi. Petra reveals Wine from the Drink Deck. Petra
and Zakhan each gain 2 Alcohol Content, then Zakhan
decides to increase his Drunken Chi by 1.
```
```
Event Example 2: Dale and Terci are on a
team. Terci reveals “Round on the House!”, so they
automatically become their team’s Champion. After
each other team chooses their Champion, Terci reveals
Dragon Breath Ale. Dale plays “This’ll keep the vermin
offa my crops!” to Ignore the Drink on Terci’s behalf.
```
```
Other Events: If a team causes a Tavern Event, or
reveals an Event Card that isn’t a Drink Event, and that
Event would affect all players, each team chooses a Champion, then the Event resolves
normally, affecting only the chosen Champions. This applies to Sea Events, Dungeon Events
and Tavern Events.
```
```
Event Example 3: Petra and Dale are on a team. At the end of their turn, they reveal
the Dungeon Event “Feats of Heroism”. They choose Dale as their Champion, so they
gain 1 Alcohol Content rather than losing 1 Fortitude.
```
## Team Variants

General rules for **all** team variants are described here. Rules specific to each specific team
variant are described below. Read this section first, then read the section explaining the team
variant you wish to play. For more detailed Team Variant rules, including card-specific notes
for previous characters, consult the RDI 6 rules, available on the SlugFest Games website
(https://slugfestgames.com).
When you play on a team, you are working together with your teammates. You each have
your own Character Deck, hand of cards and Drink Me! Pile as normal. You can look at each
other’s hands and consult on the correct plays to make. You win or lose the game together.

########## Shared Fortitude, Alcohol Content and Gold

A team has shared Fortitude, Alcohol Content and Gold. Each player may have their own
player mat if they like, but only one player per team tracks the team’s Fortitude, Alcohol
Content and Gold. When any player on a team gains or loses Fortitude, Alcohol Content or
Gold, the team’s shared stats are affected. Each **team** starts the game with 20 Fortitude, 0
Alcohol Content and 10 Gold. As with the individual game, your Fortitude may not go above
20 and your Alcohol Content may not go below 0.

########## Potion Tokens

In a team game, each team starts with a number of Potion Tokens specified
in the rules for the specific variant being played. A team may discard a Potion
Token at any time to choose **one** of the following effects: gain 6 Fortitude **OR**
lose 6 Alcohol Content **OR** gain 3 Gold from the Inn. These effects may not be
Negated, Ignored or affected in any way.

########## Shared Defense

Players on a team may play Sometimes Cards to defend each other! This includes cards that
reduce or Ignore Fortitude loss or Alcohol Content gain, cards that Ignore Drinks or Events,
cards that pay costs with Gold from the Inn or avoid paying, cards that avoid a Round of
Gambling, or even cards that “hit back” after losing Fortitude.
You may play a Sometimes Card whenever you _or a teammate_ meet the conditions that
would allow you to play that card.

```
Example 1: Ygella plays “Ooh, he’s taken a lichen to you!” to make Terci gain 2
Alcohol Content. Terci’s teammate Jett plays “Rise above adversity” to help them Ignore
Ygella’s card. The team gains no Alcohol Content.
```
```
Example 2: Terci plays “Tip the Barkeep” to make Petra pay a Gold to the Inn. Petra’s
teammate Ygella plays “How ‘bout a fancy rock instead?” so that Petra doesn’t have to
pay.
```
```
Example 3: Deirdre and Fiona (from RDI 1) are teammates. Deirdre reveals a Dragon
Breath Ale. Fiona plays “Nothing like a little belt of liquid courage!” on it, so the team
gains 4 Fortitude instead of 4 Alcohol Content.
```
########## Shared Turn Structure

A team takes their turn together, by playing the usual four phases in order. A player may not
move on to the next phase until her entire team is ready to move on.

**Discard and Draw:** Each player on the active team discards any cards they don’t want,
then they refill to their hand size simultaneously. A player may not see what their teammates
have drawn before deciding what cards to discard.

**Action:** In any order, each player on the active team may play one Action Card. A player
plays and completely resolves their Action Card before their next teammate acts. A player may
not play an Action Card on behalf of a teammate. If a player on a team doesn’t play an Action
Card, that doesn’t allow her teammates to play extras!

**Order a Drink:** The active team Orders the number of Drinks specified in the rules for the
specific team variant being played. An ordered Drink may be placed on any opponent’s Drink

```
Round on the House! Drink Event
```
```
Reveal a Drink (with possible Chasers)
from the Drink Deck. If you reveal a
Drink Event before revealing a Drink,
discard it and reveal again.
Each player (including you) drinks a
copy of the revealed Drink.
9
```

**Round of Gambling:** When a player begins a Round of Gambling, that player is
automatically chosen as their team’s Champion. Each other team chooses a Champion, then
the Round continues with only the chosen Champions participating.

```
Gambling Example 1: Jett plays “Gambling? I’m in!” to start a Round of Gambling.
His teammate Terci sits out, since Jett is automatically their team’s Champion. The Dale/
Ygella team chooses Ygella as their Champion, then the Round of Gambling continues.
```
Players other than the Champions are not included in the Round, even if the card that
started the Round would normally prevent players from avoiding it.
A Champion chosen for a Round of Gambling stays Champion for the entire Round. A
team may not switch Champions in the middle of a Round of Gambling.
Players other than the Champions may not play Gambling or Cheating Cards during the
Round. They also may not play any cards that say that you may not play them if you have
already left the Round. However, they **may** play cards that could otherwise be played during
a Round.

```
Gambling Example 2: Terci plays “Gambling? I’m in!” to start a Round of Gambling.
Later in the Round, their teammate Gerki (from RDI 1) plays “Grab a coin while no
one’s lookin’!” to steal a Gold from the pot. This is a legal play, even though Gerki is not
participating in the Round of Gambling.
```
```
Gambling Example 3: Terci plays “Gambling? I’m in!” to start a Round of Gambling.
Later in the Round, their teammate Gerki plays “Oh, I guess the Wench thought that was
her tip...” to end the Round and cause all of the anted Gold to go to the Inn.
```
**“Each player (including you)”:** When a player plays a card that affects “each player
(including you)”, each team chooses a Champion to take the effect. The player who played the
card affecting everyone **must** be chosen as that team’s Champion. (Note that this rule does not
apply to cards that affect “each other player” - see below.)

```
Example: Deirdre (from RDI 1) plays “Let’s toast the Goddess!” to make each player
drink from the Drink Deck. Deirdre is automatically her team’s Champion. Each other
team chooses a Champion, then each of the Champions takes a Drink from the Drink
Deck.
```
########## Targeting Other Players

**Another player:** If a card requires you to pick one or more other players (using the phrase
“another player” or “other player[s]”), you must pick players who aren’t on your team. If a
card requires you to pick more than one player, you may not pick the same player multiple
times, but you may pick multiple players on the same team. (If you pick multiple players on a
team, follow the rules for “each other player” below.) Note that which player(s) on a team you
choose is often not relevant due to shared defense, but Static Effects sometimes lead to game
states where the choice matters (see below).

**Pick a player:** If a card says to “pick a player” (like “Tip the Barkeep”), you may choose
any player, including a teammate or yourself.

```
Each other player: If a card affects “each other player”,
it affects each player that isn’t on your team. Note, however,
that shared defense means that a team may reduce or Ignore
such an effect with just one card!
```
```
Example 1: Jett and Ygella are teammates. Petra plays
“This is fine” to make each other player lose 1 Fortitude
(without the additional Hellfire effect). The Jett/Ygella team
loses a total of 2 Fortitude.
```
```
Example 2: Jett and Ygella are teammates. Petra plays
“This is fine.” Ygella plays “Good thing I was wearing my
great-grandmother’s bucklers!” to reduce the Fortitude
loss by 2. The Jett/Ygella team loses no Fortitude.
```
```
Each player (including you): If a card affects “each
player (including you)”, each team chooses a Champion to
```
```
take the effect. The player who played the card affecting everyone must be chosen as that
team’s Champion.
```
```
Redirection: A card that redirects an effect to another player may redirect it to a teammate
of the person who originally played that effect, even if that teammate couldn’t have been
targeted originally.
```
```
Example: Jett and Ygella are teammates. Ygella
plays “Someone’s got ants in their pants!” to make Boss
Daareka (from RDI 6) lose 2 Fortitude. Daareka plays
“My, what selfless adventurers you are!” to redirect the
effect to Jett. The Jett/Ygella team loses 2 Fortitude.
```
########## Static Effects

```
Some characters have cards or other objects that stay in
front of them and provide an effect that is “always on” while
the card or object is in play. These Static Effects include
things like Kaylin’s “Private Pixie Time”, Wulfric’s moods,
Erin’s forms, Cormac’s Rage Tiles, some of Wrench’s
Gizmos, some of Keet’s Artifacts and some of Torglesnarf’s
Minions.
Static Effects only affect an individual player, not that
player’s teammate(s). In most cases, an attacking player
can play around Static Effects by simply targeting a teammate that isn’t defended by a Static
Effect, but this isn’t always possible!
```
```
Example 1: Kaylin is on a team with Dale. Wulfric is feeling Loyal, so any Fortitude
loss that Kaylin would take is reduced by 1. Ygella plays “Someone’s got ants in their
pants!” and decides to target Dale. The Kaylin/Dale team loses 2 Fortitude, since Dale
gets no help from Wulfric’s Loyal mood.
```
```
Example 2: Ygella is on a team with Cormac who is on Rage Tile B, which makes him
deal extra damage, but take more Alcohol Content from Drinks. Ygella plays “Someone’s
got ants in their pants!” to make Terci lose 2 Fortitude. Ygella deals no additional
Fortitude loss because of Cormac’s Rage Tile. (She also takes no additional Alcohol
Content from Drinks that she drinks!)
```
```
Example 3: Jett, Erin, Wrench and Kaylin are on a team together. Erin is a Tree,
Wrench has a Buckler in a Box, and Kaylin has Wulfric feeling Loyal (all of which reduce
Fortitude loss they would take). Boss Petra plays “First rule of villainy: Burn it with fire”
to make each player on the team lose 1 Fortitude (among other effects). Erin reduces her
Fortitude loss by 2 (to a total of 0), Wrench reduces his Fortitude Loss by 1 (to a total
of 0), and Kaylin reduces her Fortitude Loss by 1 (to a total of 0). When Petra’s card
resolves, the team will lose a total of 1 Fortitude (because Jett didn’t reduce the 1 point
done to him).
```
########## “Your Turn Ends Now”

```
If a player’s turn would prematurely end, that player (and only that player) stops taking
game actions. They may not play cards for the rest of this turn, they Ignore all effects, and they
do not participate in phases for the rest of the turn. That player’s teammates continue with the
turn normally, though. The “Ignore all effects” shield does not affect them.
A character who is “not there” due to a turn-ending effect may still be chosen to act as the
team’s Champion. That character automatically Ignores the effects of whatever they are the
Champion for.
```
```
Example: Kaylin is under the turn-ending effect of “Private pixie time” when one
of her opponents reveals a Drinking Contest. Kaylin’s team chooses Kaylin as their
Champion, thereby automatically Ignoring the Drinking Contest (they don’t draw a Drink
and don’t risk any Gold).
```
```
This is fine.
Action
```
```
Each other player loses 1 Fortitude.
If you have at least 2 Hellfire, pick
another player. That player loses an
additional Fortitude.
```
```
Pick another player. They
lose 2 Fortitude.
```
```
Action - Pet
```
```
Someone’s got ants
in their pants!
```

########## Skipping or Repeating Phases

If a player plays a card that makes a player skip or repeat a phase, or repeat the special
action associated with that phase, the player playing the card chooses which player on the
affected team skips or repeats that phase or special action. Only the chosen player is affected

- their teammates are not.

```
Example 1: After each teammate has played an Action Card, Chronos plays
“Timewarp” to get another Action Phase, choosing himself as the affected player. During
the extra Action Phase, only Chronos may play another Action Card, not his teammates.
```
```
Example 2: After ordering Drinks, Chronos plays “Timewarp” to get another Order
a Drink Phase, choosing himself as the affected player. During the extra Order a Drink
Phase, Chronos may order a single extra Drink for an opponent. His teammates may not.
```
```
Example 3: Gog (from RDI 2) plays “Gog say you drink MORE!” to make Petra drink
again during her team’s Drink Phase. Only Petra drinks again. Her teammates do not.
```
###### Two-Headed Dragon

Two-Headed Dragon is a team variant in which players play in two-player teams rather
than individually. Like all team variants, it uses all of the rules under “Team Variants” above.

```
Hand Size: 7
```
```
Potion Tokens: 2 per team
```
**Setup:** You need an even number of players. Divide into teams of two. Teammates sit next
to each other so that they can see each other’s cards.
Each team takes one player mat to track Fortitude and Alcohol Content. The other teammate
may also use a player mat to hold their Character Deck, discard pile and Drink Me! Pile if they
choose, but that player mat should not have Fortitude and Alcohol Content markers on it, since
Fortitude and Alcohol Content are shared.
Each individual player has their own Drink Me! Pile that starts the game with one face-
down Drink Card.
Each player shuffles their Character Deck and draws 7 cards from it.
Each **team** takes 10 Gold and 2 Potion Tokens.

**Order a Drink Phase:** During a team’s shared Order a Drink Phase, that team orders
two Drinks, which they may place face down on any other players’ Drink Me! Piles. Drinks
ordered by a team may go to the same player, to the two players on an opposing team, or to
two different teams.

###### Boss Battle

Since Petra is a villain, she can be played as the Boss in a Boss Battle! Boss Battle is a
team variant in which one player (the Boss) plays against a team of 2, 3 or 4 other players (the
Challengers). Like all team variants, it uses all of the rules under “Team Variants” above. For
the purposes of this variant, the Boss counts as a “team of one”. So, for example, the Boss is
always the team Champion when such a choice is needed.
_Playing as the Boss is tough! We recommend this variant only for experienced Red Dragon
Inn players._

**Hand Size:** 7 for the Challengers; 8, 9 or 10 for the Boss depending on whether there are
2, 3 or 4 Challengers, respectively.

**Potion Tokens:** X for the Boss; X for the Challengers, where X is the number of
Challengers. (Note that the Challengers get X Potion Tokens _total_ , not X per player.)

```
Challenger Setup: The Challengers sit on one side of the table so that they can see each
other’s cards. The Challengers use one player mat to track Fortitude and Alcohol Content.
The other Challengers may also use player mats to hold their Character Decks, discard piles
and Drink Me! Piles if they choose, but those other player mats should not have Fortitude and
Alcohol Content markers on them, since Fortitude and Alcohol Content are shared.
Each individual Challenger has their own Drink Me! Pile that starts the game with one
face-down Drink Card.
Each Challenger shuffles their non-Boss Character Deck and draws 7 cards.
The team of Challengers takes 10 Gold and X Potion Tokens, where X is the number of
Challengers.
```
```
Boss Setup: The Boss player chooses a villainous character to play and takes the cards
and player mat for that character. (It is not possible to play a Boss Battle with a non-villain
character as the Boss.)
The Boss shuffles their Boss Cards into their Character Deck. For most Bosses, including
Petra, this will result in a 55-card Character Deck. (The Boss Cards are the ones with the
dragon heads in the upper corners.)
The Boss draws up to their hand size (8 if there are 2 Challengers, 9 if there are 3
Challengers, and 10 if there are 4 Challengers).
The Boss puts one Drink Card face down on their Drink Me! Pile.
The Boss takes 10 Gold and X Potion Tokens, where X is the number of Challengers.
```
########## The Boss’s Turn

```
The Boss always goes first. On the Boss’s turn, they take the usual phases in the usual
order, but with some different rules:
```
```
Discard and Draw: The Boss discards any cards they don’t want, then refills to their hand
size (8, 9 or 10, depending on the number of Challengers). Petra must discard Plotted Cards
before this step and may Plot a card immediately after it.
```
```
Action: The Boss may play up to X Action Cards, where X is the number of Challengers.
( Exception: during the Boss’s first turn, they may play up to 1 Action Card if there are 2
Challengers, or up to 2 Action Cards otherwise.)
If the Boss plays Action Cards that require her to pick one or more players, she may pick
any of the Challengers. The Boss is not required to target a different player with each Action
Card.
The Boss’s Action Cards are played and completely resolved one at a time. The Boss leaves
the Action Cards they play face up near their player mat so that players will remember how
many Action Cards the Boss has played so far. (This is particularly important after a long
Gambling Round!)
```
```
Example: Boss Petra is playing against Dale, Jett and Terci. She plays “Hot and
sharp, just like me!” to make Dale lose 2 Fortitude. Jett plays “Rise above adversity”
to defend Dale. Petra leaves her first Action Card near her player mat and plays her
second Action Card, “Pick your poison” to make Terci lose 1 Fortitude. The team cannot
defend, so they lose 1 Fortitude. Finally, Petra plays her third Action Card, “Do you smell
burning?” to make each other player lose 1 Fortitude. The Challengers lose 3 Fortitude.
Since Petra’s Action Phase is over, she discards the three Action Cards she played and
proceeds to her Order a Drink Phase.
```
```
Order a Drink: The Boss orders X Drinks, where X is the number of Challengers.
( Exception: during the Boss’s first turn, they order 1 Drink if there are 2 Challengers, or 2
Drinks otherwise.)
Ordered Drinks may be placed on any Challengers’ Drink Me! Piles. The Boss may
give the ordered Drinks to any Challengers (all to a single Challenger, spread out among all
Challengers, or any combination thereof).
```
```
Example: Boss Nerodia is playing against the team of Dale, Jett and Terci. During
her Order a Drink Phase, she orders 3 Drinks. She decides to give 1 to Dale and 2 to Jett.
```
```
Drink: The Boss reveals the top Drink from their Drink Me! Pile and drinks it.
```
```
(Observant readers will note that the Boss’s special first turn is essentially a “half-turn”,
rounded up.)
```

########## The Challengers’ Turn

The Challengers take their shared turn exactly as described in “Shared Turn Structure” on
page 10. An important point to remember is that each player may play up to one Action Card
during the shared Action Phase. If a Challenger doesn’t play an Action Card, that doesn’t allow
one of her teammates to play an extra one!

**Order a Drink:** During the Challengers’ shared Order a Drink Phase, they order one Drink
for the Boss (one Drink **total** , not one Drink per Challenger).

###### Two-Headed Boss Battle

The Two-Headed Boss Battle variant is the same as the Two-Headed Dragon variant, but
with each player playing a Boss Deck!

```
Hand Size: 7
```
```
Potion Tokens: 2 per team
```
**Setup:** Each player follows Boss Setup as described under Boss Battle above, but with a
hand of 7 cards.

**Order a Drink Phase:** During a team’s shared Order a Drink Phase, that team orders
two Drinks, which they may place face down on any other players’ Drink Me! Piles. Drinks
ordered by a team may go to the same player, to the two players on an opposing team, or to
two different teams.

###### Leaders and Lackeys

The Leaders and Lackeys variant is the same as the Two-Headed Boss Battle variant, but
with each team consisting of one Boss and one non-Boss character. The hilarious combinations
are nearly endless with this variant!

```
Hand Size: 7
```
```
Potion Tokens: 2 per team
```
**Setup:** Each Boss player follows Boss Setup as described under Boss Battle above, but
with a hand of 7 cards (regardless of the number of players in the game). Each Lackey player
shuffles their puny non-Boss Character Deck and draws a hand of 7 cards.

**Order a Drink Phase:** During a team’s shared Order a Drink Phase, that team orders
two Drinks, which they may place face down on any other players’ Drink Me! Piles. Drinks
ordered by a team may go to the same player, to the two players on an opposing team, or to
two different teams.

## Other Variants

######## Otto, Our Mechanical Friend

```
The mechanically-minded adventurers Wizgille and Wrench have teamed up to build an
automaton to join in on the party when the tavern is a little empty. Otto adds an automated third
player to a two-player game! The Red Dragon Inn works for two players even without this
variant, but you may want to try playing with Otto if you want a more tactical and unpredictable
mode of play where gambling takes on more importance. (If you’ve never played the game
before, however, we recommend at least one game without Otto to familiarize yourself with
the basics.)
This product includes 10 new cards for Otto, which come in two different factions that
determine his style of play:
```
```
Setup: Place Otto’s player mat so that one of his 0-6 tracks is oriented toward one player
and the other is oriented toward the other player. Place a Fortitude marker on each of the 6’s
and an Alcohol Content marker on each of the 0’s. Choose two of Otto’s factions and shuffle
them together so that he has a 10-card deck. The other factions will not be used this game.
(Note that you can mix any of Otto’s ten factions if you also have factions from another RDI
product!)
Because Otto counts as a third player, the non-Otto players start the game with 10 Gold
instead of 8. Otto always goes first.
```
```
General Rules: Otto cannot win or lose the game - he simply acts as a foil to the two other
players. When one of the non-automated players is eliminated, the other immediately wins.
Player turns, including Otto’s, proceed clockwise around the table as usual.
Otto does not have a hand of cards, so he may not draw or discard cards. Otto has no Gold.
If he would pay Gold, he pays with Gold from the Inn. If a player pays Otto Gold, that Gold
goes to the Inn. Otto does not have a Drink Me! Pile - when he must drink, he drinks from the
Drink Deck. Players may not Order Drinks for Otto. There is one exception: The Wench (from
RDI 7) may give her Special Reserve Drinks to Otto.
```
```
Two Fortitude-Alcohol Tracks: Otto has two separate Fortitude-Alcohol tracks - one for
each player in the game. If a player causes Otto’s Fortitude or Alcohol Content to change, only
that player’s track is affected. Other actions (such as drinking on his turn) cause both tracks
to be affected.
If Otto “passes out” on a track, reset that track to 0 and 6, then that player may either gain
1 Gold from the Inn or draw 2 cards from their Character Deck. Otto is never eliminated
from the game.
```
```
Otto’s Deck: At various points in the game, you will
reveal a card from Otto’s Deck and follow the instructions
in one section of the revealed card. If Otto’s Deck runs out,
shuffle his discard pile and use that as the new Otto Deck.
This happens immediately, with one important exception: if
Otto runs out of cards during a Round of Gambling, do
not reshuffle his deck until the Round is over.
```
```
Otto’s Turn: Otto only has two phases on his turn:
Action and Drink. He does not Discard and Draw, and he
does not Order Drinks.
On Otto’s Action Phase, reveal and discard the top card
of the Otto Deck and follow the instructions in the “Action”
box. If the instructions specify a player such as “the player
with the most Fortitude” and the players are tied on the
specified attribute, both players take the effect.
```
########## Berserker Spelunker

```
Otto deploys climbing spikes!
Each other player loses 1
Fortitude.
```
```
“Pass.”
```
```
Action, Sometimes, Anytime:
The player who played the card
loses 1 Fortitude. (The card still
takes effect.)
```

On Otto’s Drink Phase, he drinks a Drink (with possible Chasers) from the Drink Deck.
Any Fortitude or Alcohol effect he takes from that Drink affects **both** of his tracks. This
remains true even if one player alters Otto’s Drink.

**Targeting Otto:** Otto counts as a player in the game, which means that he can be affected
whenever a player plays a card that uses wording like “pick another player,” “each other
player,” or “each player.” When a player plays an effect that affects Otto’s Fortitude or Alcohol
Content, only that player’s track is affected.

```
Example: Petra plays “This is fine” to make each other player lose 1 Fortitude. Jett
loses 1 Fortitude, and Otto loses 1 Fortitude on the track closest to Petra. Otto’s track on
Jett’s side is not affected.
```
If a player card causes Otto to be affected by a Drink or an Event (for example, Deirdre’s
“Let’s toast the Goddess!”), only that player’s track is affected.

**Gambling:** Otto always antes with Gold from the Inn. If it is Otto’s turn to act in a Round
of Gambling, reveal the top card of his deck and follow the instructions in the bottom box,
labeled “Gambling” or “Cheating”. If the play he makes would be illegal (for example, an
effect labeled “Gambling” after a “Winning Hand!”), he passes instead.

```
Example: Dale plays “Winning Hand!” to take
control of the Round of Gambling. Berserker Otto
reveals a Gambling Card with the effect “Otto leaves
the Round of Gambling.” Since a Gambling Card can’t
take effect after a “Winning Hand!”, Otto does not
leave the Round. He passes instead.
```
Remember that Otto’s Deck does not reshuffle during
a Round of Gambling. If he runs out of cards during a
Round, he passes until the Round is over. Reshuffle his deck
afterward.

**Responses:** When Otto is affected by a Drink, Action,
Sometimes or Anytime Card that affects his Fortitude,
Alcohol Content or Gold, reveal the top card of the Otto
Deck and follow the instructions in the “Sometimes” box.
The instructions may refer to a certain card type in bold,
such as “ **Action, Sometimes or Anytime** ” or “ **Drink** ”. In that case, the response only applies
to that type of card. If the card that triggered Otto is not of the specified type, Otto does not
respond.
Otto’s “Sometimes” effects count as Sometimes Cards. This means, for example, that they
can be Negated by “I don’t think so!”
Some of Otto’s response effects refer to “the affected track(s)”. This means the track(s) that
are affected by the effect that triggered Otto. If an effect triggers Otto but affects neither of his
Fortitude-Alcohol tracks, then any response that refers to “the affected track(s)” does nothing.
If a non-Otto card says that it can be affected as though it were an Action Card, then Otto
reveals a Sometimes effect in response.
If Otto would reveal a response during a Round of Gambling, but his deck has no cards,
he does not respond.

**Choices:** If a non-Otto card gives Otto the choice to pay Gold, discard cards, lose Fortitude,
gain Alcohol Content, or split a Drink, Otto chooses not to do so, suffering the consequences
of that choice.
If a card would force Otto to discard cards, nothing happens. If there is a penalty for not
discarding enough cards, Otto ignores it.
For any choices not covered by the previous paragraphs, Otto always chooses the first
option. For example, the Dungeon Event “Staring Contest” (from RDI 6) causes Otto to lose
2 Alcohol Content on both tracks.
If a card requires Otto to bid or secretly choose some amount of something, he always
chooses zero.

**Other Otto Rules:** If Otto would ever make an illegal play, he instead does nothing.
Otto may not be used in a Team Variant game.
Some cards refer to the player to Otto’s left or right. The player to Otto’s left is the one after
him in clockwise turn order.

```
If you are playing with the Prize Variant and Otto starts a Round of Gambling, he does not
add a Prize to the pot. If Otto wins a Prize, it returns to the Inn with no effect.
Otto is affected normally by Natyli’s Debuffs, Remy’s Marks and Amundyr’s Scarabs.
Extra damage from such components affects only that player’s track.
If Otto would get an Artifact from Keet, that Artifact is discarded instead.
Otto never targets Wrench’s Gizmos or Torglesnarf’s Minions except with cards that affect
“each other player”.
Daareka may not target Otto with a card that allows her to make choices for a player.
The Wench may give Special Reserve Drinks to Otto. If Otto has Special Reserve Drinks
in front of him, he treats those as the top cards of the Drink Deck whenever he must drink
during his Drink Phase.
Warthorn may not give his Story Cards to Otto.
If Otto gets a Blessing from Murgath, he immediately reveals it and plays it for its healing
effect. The effect is applied only to the Otto track closest to Murgath. If the Blessing doesn’t
have a healing effect, it is discarded.
If Otto gets a Drink that instructs Otto to keep it in front of him, he takes its initial effect,
then discards it.
If a card would force Otto to play an Action Card, or give him the opportunity to play an
additional Action Card, he instead does nothing.
```
###### The Bar Deck Variant

```
The Red Dragon Inn is designed to be played with a 30-card Drink Deck, so that the deck
will run out during the game and force everyone to pay Gold to the Inn. However, there are
now many more than 30 unique Drink Cards available across all expansions. If you’d like to
play with a Drink Deck of more than 30 cards, use this variant.
```
```
Setup: Shuffle together all of the Drink Cards you wish to use for the game. This is the
Bar Deck. Count out 30 cards from the Bar Deck face down and use those cards as your Drink
Deck at the start of the game.
```
```
When the Drink Deck runs out, each player pays 1 Gold to the Inn, as normal. Then, take
the next 30 cards from the Bar Deck and use them as your replacement Drink Deck. If the Bar
Deck runs out during this process, shuffle all of the discarded Drink Cards and use that as your
new Bar Deck.
```
```
The Bar Deck must be made up of Red Dragon Inn Drink Cards, with the backs marked
“Drink Deck”. Tavern Drink Cards for the Pub Crawl Variant may not be used in the Bar Deck.
However, it is possible to play a game with both the Pub Crawl Variant and the Bar Deck
Variant. Simply use the Bar Deck as the Red Dragon Inn Drink Deck and use the usual Tavern
Decks for the other taverns.
```
###### The Prize Variant

```
Some promotional cards, including Dale’s Finest
Mushroom, Speedy Runner’s Stopwatch and Straw of
Misdirection in this product, have the type “Prize”. The
Prize Variant provides an optional way to spice up Rounds
of Gambling. To play with this variant, add any number
of unique Prize Cards to the Inn at the start of the game.
Whenever a player starts a Round of Gambling, that
player must choose one of the Prize Cards in the Inn and
add it to the pot before players ante. The player who wins the pot also takes the Prize and
follows its instructions at the appropriate time.
Using a Prize will cause it to move to the Prize Bin, a holding pile for used Prizes. The
Prize Bin ensures that each Prize must be won once before any Prize can be won again. If a
player starts a Round of Gambling and there are no Prizes in the Inn, move all Prizes from the
Prize Bin to the Inn, then choose a Prize as normal. If a player starts a Round of Gambling and
```
```
The next time you would drink a Drink during another player’s turn, add this card to the Prize Bin and give that Drink to another
player. This effect counts as though you played a Sometimes Card on that Drink.
```
```
Straw of Misdirection Prize
```
```
OTTO ANGRY NOW!
Reset both of Otto’s tracks.
```
```
Action, Sometimes, Anytime:
The player who played the card
loses 2 Fortitude. (The card still
takes effect.)
Otto leaves the Round of
Gambling. (If that is illegal,
Otto passes.)
```

there are no Prizes in the Inn **and** no Prizes in the Prize Bin, that Round of Gambling simply
doesn’t include a Prize.
If the pot goes to the Inn, the Prize in that pot goes to the Inn with it.

**Stealing Gold from the Pot:** A Prize is not Gold, so it cannot be stolen from the pot with
cards like Jett’s “Wanna see a coin trick?”. Stealing Gold from the pot does not cause you to
win the Prize, even if you happen to steal the last Gold from the pot.

**Taking the Pot Without Winning the Round:** A few characters, including Gerki,
Torglesnarf, and The Wench can take the pot without actually winning the Round of Gambling.
If they do this, they get the Prize.

**Captain Whitehawk:** If Captain Whitehawk takes half the pot with “What a coincidence,
I happen to have the same hand!”, the original winner chooses whether to give the Prize to
Captain Whitehawk or to keep it for themselves.

**Events:** If an Event Card starts a Round of Gambling, the active player chooses which
Prize to add to the pot.

**Teams:** In a team game, a Prize is won by the individual player who takes the pot. That
Prize may only be used by that player, not by that player’s teammates.

###### Card-Specific Notes

**A race? You’re on!:** This card’s first effect includes a number, so it can be affected by cards
that change numeric effects, such as Strength Potion. However, this card’s second effect does
not include a numeric effect, so cards that change numeric effects won’t do anything.

**Can’tcha see I’m sharpenin’ my tools?:** This card may Ignore any Event, including
Drink Events, Sea Events, Dungeon Events and Tavern Events.

**Folks say I’m outstanding in my field!:** This card ends your turn, but unlike some other
turn-ending cards, it does not cause you to be “out of the game” for a time. Your turn simply
ends, then the game proceeds normally.

**Here’s a tough row to hoe:** When you play this card, you must choose whether to Plant or
Grow, as well as which player will lose 2 Fortitude, before any player has a chance to respond.

**Hot five!:** This card’s first effect includes a number, so it can be affected by cards that
change numeric effects, such as Strength Potion. However, this card’s second effect does not
include a numeric effect, so cards that change numeric effects won’t do anything.

**I guess I’ll stick with this hand:** This card counts as a Cheating card if you choose its
first effect and a Sometimes card if you choose its second effect. Disregard the card type
corresponding to the unplayed ability.

**Look. Dastardly schemes don’t plan themselves:** This card may Ignore any Event,
including Drink Events, Sea Events, Dungeon Events and Tavern Events.

**Ridiculously flexible:** This card may Ignore any Event, including Drink Events, Sea
Events, Dungeon Events and Tavern Events.

**Something on the Rocks:** This Drink always gets a Chaser, even though its title doesn’t
include the phrase “with a Chaser”.

**Sorry, I’m on patrol duty:** This card may Ignore any Event, including Drink Events, Sea
Events, Dungeon Events and Tavern Events.

**Straw of Misdirection:** After you win this Prize, you must play it on the next Drink that
you would drink on another player’s turn, even if that Drink would be beneficial to you. You

```
may give the Drink to any other player - the active player or some other player. Players may
respond to this effect with cards like “The Barkeep thinks you should stop playing with the
drinks.”
```
```
That tears it!: You may play this card with its Harvest effect in response to a card that can’t
be Ignored. If you do, you won’t Ignore the card, but you will cause the player who played it
to lose 2 Fortitude. You may also play this card against Fortitude loss that doesn’t allow you
to hit back, such as Amundyr’s Scarabs. In that case, you will Ignore the Fortitude loss, but
not hit back.
```
```
The monsters kicked open the door!: Discarding an Action Card in this way does not
count as playing it. It has none of its usual effects. The Action Card you discard must be in
your hand. You may not (for example) discard a Plotted Card, a Mushroom or a Waiting
Patient. Terci may discard a Patient from their hand with the subtype Action, though.
```
```
The Star Mole Drinking Hole: A Character Card is any card that could legally be shuffled
into your Character Deck. It includes any card that started the game in your Character Deck,
as well as any card that could be added to it, such as Vlazlo’s Forms and Roxana’s Recipes. It
does not include side deck cards like Mushrooms or Patients (even Patients in Terci’s hand).
If a player is unable to put a Character Card on top of their Character Deck, they do nothing.
```
```
Too hot to handle: You may play this card in response to a card that can’t be Ignored.
If you do, you won’t Ignore the card, but you will cause the player who played it to lose 1
Fortitude. You may also play this card against Fortitude loss that doesn’t allow you to hit back,
such as Amundyr’s Scarabs. In that case, you will Ignore the Fortitude loss, but not hit back.
```
```
Wanna hold one?: You must reveal the Pet Card you get out of your discard pile before
putting it into your hand.
```
```
Who wants a Spelunker Snack?: If your Character Deck runs out of cards while revealing,
shuffle your discard pile into a new Character Deck, then continue revealing.
